7,10,Grey Dawn,41073,Cartman,Old people gone mad! ;;;
7,10,Grey Dawn,41143,Cartman,So our only solution is to cut off their life force. ;;;
7,10,Grey Dawn,41145,Cartman,No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply. [runs his finger along the map to its destination] Here. ;;;
"7,10,Grey Dawn,41147,Cartman,""Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do. """;;;
7,10,Grey Dawn,41149,Cartman,Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. ;;;
"7,10,Grey Dawn,41152,Cartman,""I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight. """;;;
"7,10,Grey Dawn,41153,Cartman,""We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.

"7,10,Grey Dawn,41154,Cartman,""Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. """;;;

"9,2,""Die Hippie, Die"",47085,Cartman,""These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard. """;;;

"9,2,""Die Hippie, Die"",47089,Cartman,""Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony. """;;;

"9,2,""Die Hippie, Die"",47150,Cartman,""I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.

[connects the projector to the laptop, and the projector turns on. Everyone then looks at the screen. Cartman goes to it and points a few things out] Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour.

"9,2,""Die Hippie, Die"",47152,Cartman,""It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks.

I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. [the adults don't get it, Cartman sighs heavily] """;;;
"9,2,""Die Hippie, Die"",47154,Cartman,""I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast! """;;;

"11,2,Cartman Sucks,54887,Cartman,""This picture I like to call """"The Pierre"""". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads """"THE PIERRE 3/10/07."""" Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture """"The Sleeping Menstrual"""". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call """"Hot Fudge Mondae"""".

"11,2,Cartman Sucks,54889,Cartman,""Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it """"New Moon Rising"""". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here.

"11,2,Cartman Sucks,54913,Cartman,""It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness] """;;;

11,2,Cartman Sucks,54944,Cartman,It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever! ;;;

11,2,Cartman Sucks,54960,Cartman,Uh! [quickly gets dressed up] ;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54985,Cartman,Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me! ;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,54987,Cartman,""[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said! """;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,54989,Cartman,""[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right.

"11,2,Cartman Sucks,54991,Cartman,""Right, except for you. """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54993,Cartman,[turns around] Why would you tell anybody? ;;;

"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55022,Cartman,""Where is it, you filthy Jew?! """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55024,Cartman,[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what! ;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55027,Cartman,""I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?! """;;;

[grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA! """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55043,Cartman,Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski. ;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55045,Cartman,""It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back! """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55047,Cartman,[long pause] Why... why does that matter? ;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55049,Cartman,All right. It's a picture ...of me. ;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55051,Cartman,It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth. ;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55053,Cartman,""No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture! """;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55055,Cartman,""Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep. """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55057,Cartman,I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell! ;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55074,Cartman,That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW! ;;;

"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55085,Cartman,""But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay!

"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55087,Cartman,""[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee! [turns to her and cries into her chest] """;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55089,Cartman,""You, you will? """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55114,Cartman,It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her] ;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55116,Cartman,[his smile vanishes] What? ;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55118,Cartman,""Mom, she's lying! """;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55120,Cartman,""Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time! """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55122,Cartman,[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh. ;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55142,Cartman,""Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction! """;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55146,Cartman,""HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call """"Moods of Winter"""" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps? """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55148,Cartman,And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to] ;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55167,Cartman,And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps] ;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55170,Cartman,Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft. ;;;
"11,2,Cartman Sucks,55172,Cartman,""What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that- """;;;
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55174,Cartman,[longer pause] ...Lame. ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55177,Cartman,""Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem. [points to Kyle, but blocks Kyle's view of his left hand with his right.] Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it. """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55182,Cartman,Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny. ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55197,Cartman,""[answering] They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. [Butters gasps] """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55199,Cartman,This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home. ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55264,Cartman,""Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened? """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55271,Cartman,""Well who was it? [points to Kenny] It was Kenny, right? """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55273,Cartman,""Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who! [points to Kenny again] It was Kenny, wasn't it? """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55276,Cartman,[pounds on his desk] That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast! ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55294,Cartman,""All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! [Opposite Cartman are Jimmy, Tweek, Clyde, Anne, Bebe, Red. and two other kids. With Cartman are Craig, Tolkien, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Kevin, Butters, and Wendy] """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55296,Cartman,""Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself! """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55298,Cartman,Me?! ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55300,Cartman,""I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me! """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55302,Cartman,""That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. [Stan is stunned] """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55304,Cartman,And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face] ;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55309,Cartman,There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! [turns left and walks away. Clyde looks around] ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55331,Cartman,""All right, lock that door, Craig! [Craig goes to lock the door] """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55333,Cartman,""I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice. [whips out a little propane torch from his right pocket] We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties. [whips out a lighter from his left pocket, strikes the lighter on, and uses the lighter to light the torch. He puts the lighter away. Clyde is scared now.] Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air. """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55336,Cartman,""[figuring out how to respond] This is a scientific test, designed to- """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55338,Cartman,""I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?! """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55340,Cartman,""If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice! """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55345,Cartman,Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you. ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55347,Cartman,""All right, now everyone back over there! [the boys head back to the bench] We'll start with what I already know. [moves the heated coil tip over the blood sample. Only steam comes from it] """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55350,Cartman,""Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle! [takes Kyle's Petri dish and ...the same thing happens] Huh, I guess you're clean. [tries another Petri dish] """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55352,Cartman,""It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! [sticks the tip into the Petri dish, causing the blood to heat up and jump out of the dish. He gets the blood all over himself, and for good measure, tosses the rest of the blood onto himself.] """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55354,Cartman,Kenny! ;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55357,Cartman,""Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! [silence for a second or two, then Kenny bolts for the door, pushing Craig aside, opening the door, and running down the hall] """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55375,Cartman,""He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen. [beat] Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! [they turn and head off] """;;;

"11,3,Lice Capades,55379,Cartman,""All right, see you there! [the guys turn around and leave] Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it! """;;;

"11,3,Lice Capades,55409,Cartman,""All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! [the boys gang up on Kenny and give him the sock bath] """;;;
"11,3,Lice Capades,55419,Cartman,""Oh I get it. [walks up to Stan and Kyle] This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?! """;;;
11,3,Lice Capades,55421,Cartman,Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?! ;;;

11,4,The Snuke,55464,Cartman,[stops suddenly] That's funny. ;;;
11,4,The Snuke,55466,Cartman,He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182. ;;;

"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59510,Cartman,""How do I reach these keeds? [faces the class, his left hand tucked under the left pant pocket] The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time. [holds up a picture] This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top. """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59512,Cartman,""No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy. """;;;

"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59529,Cartman,""What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn. [the boy is on offense. He dribbles for a few seconds and moves to the basket, but Cartman again takes out his pointer and whacks the boy's left shin. The boy falls again, and Cartman steals the ball and scores again. The boy at the scoreboard updates the score: 2-0 Visitors] That's two to nothing, amigoo. [his opponent stands up] """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59531,Cartman,""Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. [throws the ball back at the boy] """;;;

"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59552,Cartman,""Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time. [hops onto a box so he could write on the chalkboard. He draws a video camera aimed at a box marked D] When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- [the errant student returns] """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59554,Cartman,""Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack. [the student takes his seat] All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: """"I mis-interpreted the rules."""" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! """"I mis-interpreted the rules."""" Say it with me. """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59556,Cartman,Good. Again. ";;;

"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59586,Cartman,""[sighs] How do I reach these keeds? [turns around and faces her] All right, let's go get you an abortion. """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59588,Cartman,Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you? ";;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59590,Cartman,""Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself. [Melita turns right and walks off a bit] Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life. """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59592,Cartman,""Mexicans are told not to cheat. """"Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."""" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.

"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59629,Cartman,Uh what? ";;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59634,Cartman,""Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them. """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59636,Cartman,""How do I reeeach these keeeeds?! [the boy, cowed, slips back into his seat. Cartman faces the board] Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, """"Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."""" You know what happened? [dryly] They lost. [faces the class] Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives. """;;;
"12,5,""Eek, A Penis!"",59638,Cartman,You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water. ";;;

13,5,Fishsticks,63352,Cartman,Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. [the audience applauds and cheers] ;;;
"13,5,Fishsticks,63355,Cartman,""Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia. """;;;
13,5,Fishsticks,63357,Cartman,Uhhh excuse me? [the crowd gets rowdy.] ;;;
"13,5,Fishsticks,63361,Cartman,""Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials. """;;;

"13,5,Fishsticks,63384,Cartman,""Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy. """;;;

"13,5,Fishsticks,63398,Cartman,""Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now. """;;;
"13,5,Fishsticks,63400,Cartman,""All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently.

"13,5,Fishsticks,63402,Cartman,""I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.

How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!

He's harvesting berries with the Smurfs] They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette. [He and the diminutive Smurfette sit on a log watching the sun set] We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion. """;;;
"13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65368,Cartman,""Papa Smurf was displeased at first, [Cartman tries to catch up to Smurfette as her father takes her into their mushroom house] He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland. """;;;
"13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65379,Cartman,""And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it?

[rings a bell and leaves his chair] Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon. [presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast] You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? [shows a birthday cake] Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.

"17,7,Black Friday,78111,Cartman,""Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters. """;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78114,Cartman,We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! [the boys cheer this good news] ;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78118,Cartman,""That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday. """;;;

"17,7,Black Friday,78172,Cartman,""You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances. """;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78174,Cartman,""[with his right hand over his nose] Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners. """;;;

"17,7,Black Friday,78226,Cartman,""I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever... [picks out a yellow rose and gives it to Kenny] switch sides, [Kenny sniffs it] it could make Stan's army problematic for us. """;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78228,Cartman,""True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours. [stops and faces Kenny] Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors. """;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78230,Cartman,""You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other? """;;;

"17,7,Black Friday,78270,Cartman,""Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth. """;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78296,Cartman,""Alright, stop, stop, stop! [leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters] This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! [swings his staff at Scott's mouth and lands it, making Scott's tongue go back in his mouth] """;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78298,Cartman,""There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! [leaves] """;;;

"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78308,Cartman,""Stupid asshole!

Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.

"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78344,Cartman,""Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick. """;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78346,Cartman,""Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. [picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.] How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones? """;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78348,Cartman,Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you? ;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78350,Cartman,So what happens when the dragons show up? ;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78352,Cartman,Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny. ;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78354,Cartman,Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers. ;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78356,Cartman,""He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not.

17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78358,Cartman,[shoots back] Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here! ;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78360,Cartman,Why don't you mind your own business?! ;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78404,Cartman,""Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan. """;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78406,Cartman,""It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army [picks a rose out for Kyle], but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.

17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78408,Cartman,That could be up to you. ;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78410,Cartman,""Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right. [begins walking] Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security? """;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78412,Cartman,""Seems a little convenient, doesn't it? [stops and faces Kyle] Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now?

"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78414,Cartman,""Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops! """;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78416,Cartman,Yeah! ;;;

"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78440,Cartman,""Forward, men! [the bearers try to fit Cartman through the door, but they can't fit through.

"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78444,Cartman,""I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick? """;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78448,Cartman,""You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday. """;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78451,Cartman,""Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess! """;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78454,Cartman,That doesn't even make sense. ;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78459,Cartman,""You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! [Stan and Kenny look at each other, then Stan thinks a minute] """;;;

"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78473,Cartman,""Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.

"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78579,Cartman,""Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay? """;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78581,Cartman,""Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess. """;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78585,Cartman,""We know a way inside the Red Robin. [this stops Stan, Jimmy and Craig] You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how. """;;;

They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with. [An image of the office appears, with the new changes] To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting. [a pair of tits and male genitalia are added to the original logo, to much cheer and applause] Now when people hear the name """"Redskins"""", they will immediately think """"titties"""" and """"balls"""". It's just a bold new way that we can say """"We don't fucking care."""" Go Redskins! [cheering and applause] """;;;

"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94865,Cartman,""[while looking at Stan and Kyle] You guys, Kenny and I are feeling like, even though things are supposedly getting better with the pandemic, we're more depressed than ever.

Kenny was saying he wants to do everything he can to save the broship, and I agree with him. So we had a really positive talk about it during lunch, and Kenny shared some ideas of how maybe we can navigate through this, and I think we came up with a great idea. Okay, so, you know how chicks have periods right? """;;;
"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94867,Cartman,""It's true! Women have """"periods"""" where they bleed from their vagina. Remember earlier today, Stan, you said our teacher was wearing white?

There was lots of ketchup laying around. So me and Kenny snuck into the classroom during recess and put it on the teacher's chair, and now when we get back to class there's gonna be a bunch of ketchup [Stan and Kyle look at each other] on the teacher's chair and when she stands up it's gonna totally look like she got her period!

"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94881,Cartman,""Which one should we post, you guys? Should we post the one where you can see the most blood on teacher's ass or the one where she makes the dumbest face? """;;;
"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94885,Cartman,""Hey, at least Kenny and I were doing something to try and get that spark back. You know 30 percent of broships didn't make it through the pandemic? """;;;
"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94888,Cartman,""Yeah, you missed it! It was the best thing ever! [shows the phone] We put ketchup in the teacher's seat and made her think it was her period! """;;;

"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95293,Cartman,""But we all want what's best for Kenny, so we have to find a way to compromise and move on with our lives. So how do we do it? We use... a 2-2-3.

A place that people from all over Colorado would want to come and see! And we would be the owners. And we could have all the hot dogs we wanted. """;;;
"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98091,Cartman,""Aren't you sick of living like this, Kenny? All we need is an investor, and we can make our dreams come true. And I know somebody who has a bank account and gets paychecks every week. """;;;

"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98141,Cartman,""Yes, we're the owners. """;;;
"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98143,Cartman,""So, what does that mean? """;;;
"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98145,Cartman,""Well, obviously, we're not going to lose the zip line, so let's see what we can do. """;;;

"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98148,Cartman,""Alright, everyone, it's looking good, but we have aways to go. I don't know about you, but I am exhausted. I think we should all just take the rest of the day off because it's Wet's-Not-Work-Too-Hard Wednesday. """;;;

26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98173,Cartman,Butters. Butters! Would you relax? ;;;
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98175,Cartman,You said to get things moving. We needed the funds to go faster. ;;;
"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98177,Cartman,""Butters, we're about to reopen a historic landmark that means something to people. You think I'm just doing all this for the fun of it? Hang on a second. """;;;

26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98186,Cartman,Hey! Hey! Excuse me! You want to come work at DikinBaus for minimum wage? ;;;
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98189,Cartman,That's 'cause your generation is lazy! You got all comfy during the pandemic! Nobody knows how to work anymore! ;;;

"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98231,Cartman,""Butters, the truth is, we tried. The fact of the matter is, the U.S. government failed this generation by shutting down businesses in the pandemic, and now they don't know how to go back. I'm sorry, but we lost all your money. But there is a good side to this because, as you can see, I now have a house that has slides, and games, and a mermaid grotto. And you can come and hang out all you want. """;;;
"26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98239,Cartman,""You guys, it's working! We're doing it! """;;;

"6,1,Jared Has Aides,32568,Kyle,""Yeah, you're still fat! """;;;
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32575,Kyle,Why are you doing this to us?! ;;;
"6,1,Jared Has Aides,32581,Kyle,""[faces Stan] Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip. """;;;
"6,1,Jared Has Aides,32585,Kyle,""Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. [Cartman picks up one end of the tube and inserts it into the incision] """;;;
"6,1,Jared Has Aides,32589,Kyle,""The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. [Cartman stalls, then picks up the other end and starts sucking the fat out] """;;;

"6,1,Jared Has Aides,32602,Kyle,""It's out of control! [Stan has stopped pounding, but the fat is pulsing out and Cartman can't control it.. Butters gets thinner by the second and headed for shock] """;;;

"6,1,Jared Has Aides,32729,Kyle,""Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it.

"6,2,Asspen,32767,Kyle,""No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee. """;;;

6,3,Freak Strike,33133,Kyle,We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know. ;;;

7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39702,Kyle,Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it. ;;;

7,13,Butt Out,41872,Kyle,[seizing the opportunity] Yeah. This is really their fault. ;;;
7,13,Butt Out,41878,Kyle,[to Stan] Who's Rob Reiner? ;;;
"7,13,Butt Out,41884,Kyle,""You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke. """;;;

7,13,Butt Out,42017,Kyle,No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded. ;;;

8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42986,Kyle,[pulls out his nunchucks] So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons. ;;;
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,42996,Kyle,They're Olympic games for handicapped people. ;;;

"8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43072,Kyle,""No you're not! [whips out the brochure] I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics. """;;;

"8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43158,Kyle,""Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. [they look at each other and Cartman closes a book he had open for reference] """;;;
"8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43160,Kyle,""I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell.

"8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43404,Kyle,""Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over. """;;;

8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43410,Kyle,But how can the Jews make it better?? ;;;

"8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43448,Kyle,""Thank you, rabbi. [Sheila smiles and gets Gerald's attention. Kyle clears his throat.] In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus. """;;;

15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70458,Kyle,Lots of people will when I tell them! ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70460,Kyle,You what? ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70462,Kyle,A thousand dollars. ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70467,Kyle,There's a big wait to sit down. ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70473,Kyle,Jesus Christ. ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70478,Kyle,Wow... ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70487,Kyle,""[turns away from the window and walks a few steps] And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side. """;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70491,Kyle,""Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest. """;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70493,Kyle,""I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff. """;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70495,Kyle,Crack baby... basketball. ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70497,Kyle,""No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.

[soon, babies are heard. Kyle is showing Stan one of the Crack Baby Fight videos] I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before. [Stan stays quiet] It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits. [Stan stays quiet] Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's? """;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70519,Kyle,""Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need. [glances at Stan] Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything. [glances at Stan again] Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society.

"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70521,Kyle,""[puts his right hand on his stomach as if punched there] Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault! """;;;

15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70528,Kyle,I need to talk to you. [puts a folder down on the desk] ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70530,Kyle,[opens the folder] In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies. ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70532,Kyle,But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that. ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70534,Kyle,Gut they're the ones risking injury. ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70536,Kyle,""The government could come after us, Cartman. """;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70538,Kyle,So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go? ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70540,Kyle,A hot tub?! ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70542,Kyle,Gravy? ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70544,Kyle,No way. ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70546,Kyle,""I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal. """;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70548,Kyle,What other companies? ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70566,Kyle,""Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies. [Stan just blinks, still half-awake. Kyle turns and looks at him] Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken! """;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70568,Kyle,It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! [turns around and walks out] ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70577,Kyle,""[setting up] Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies. """;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70579,Kyle,""I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care! """;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70581,Kyle,...What? ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70605,Kyle,""And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course. [gets no reaction from Stan] Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter? """;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70612,Kyle,What? ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70622,Kyle,""Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all! """;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70625,Kyle,Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing. ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70627,Kyle,You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go! ;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70631,Kyle,""You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to! """;;;
"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70635,Kyle,""It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go. [something grabs his attention] No way!

"15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70637,Kyle,""This is it, Stan! [runs across the street and enters the orphanage. Stan trails behind.

15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70639,Kyle,But who paid for all this? [Stan catches up and the nurse leaves] ;;;
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70641,Kyle,You don't think that-? But he isn't real. ;;;

"17,7,Black Friday,78138,Kyle,""No! We can't divide like this! [Stan leaves the XBox group] Stan? [Stan turns around] You're on our side, right? """;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78140,Kyle,""[stunned, then] Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One. """;;;

17,7,Black Friday,78144,Kyle,I know. ;;;

"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78455,Kyle,""[steps forward] Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control. """;;;

In the past, Jews were shut out of most professions, so they came to dominate vaudeville, which back then was considered too low-brow for good Christians.

4,3,Timmy 2000,22149,Stan,I know! ;;;
"4,3,Timmy 2000,22166,Stan,""Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded. """;;;
4,3,Timmy 2000,22168,Stan,But he is- ;;;
4,3,Timmy 2000,22215,Stan,He doesn't have to do homework? ;;;

4,3,Timmy 2000,22295,Stan,But he's funny. ;;;
"4,3,Timmy 2000,22313,Stan,""Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is. """;;;
"4,3,Timmy 2000,22315,Stan,""Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff. """;;;
4,3,Timmy 2000,22326,Stan,Because we're on Ritalin. ;;;

4,3,Timmy 2000,22399,Stan,Let's watch something else. ;;;
4,3,Timmy 2000,22404,Stan,Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up? ;;;
"4,3,Timmy 2000,22407,Stan,""Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter. """;;;
4,3,Timmy 2000,22410,Stan,Sounds good. ;;;
"4,3,Timmy 2000,22412,Stan,""Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny. """;;;

"4,3,Timmy 2000,22491,Stan,""No! [steps forward] You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be """"protected"""" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules! """;;;
"4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22520,Stan,""Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns """;;;

"6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37231,Stan,""Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully. [the applause dies down] This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? [puts his hand to his temple] They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter. """;;;
"6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37234,Stan,""No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, """"Peter was your husband?"""" """;;;
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37238,Stan,[getting annoyed] Stop it! I didn't do anything! ;;;
"6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37240,Stan,""[reminding] I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, """"They want me to acknowledge Peter."""" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, """"I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely."""" """;;;
"6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37245,Stan,""[frustrated, with right hand over his clenched eyelids] Okay. Let's back up. [each audience row backs up to the one behind it] Not literally! """;;;
"6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37266,Stan,""Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience. """;;;

"6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37274,Stan,""Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going?

"6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37303,Stan,""You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all  just stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole? [the audience is listening] We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. [more audience listening, reflection. Kyle is present.

"7,10,Grey Dawn,41186,Stan,""Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it. """;;;

7,12,All About Mormons,41599,Stan,That's not what the Harrisons said. ;;;
7,12,All About Mormons,41601,Stan,The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right. ;;;

7,12,All About Mormons,41707,Stan,What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground? ;;;
"7,12,All About Mormons,41709,Stan,""Yeah, but... how? """;;;
"7,12,All About Mormons,41732,Stan,""Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat? """;;;
"7,12,All About Mormons,41734,Stan,""It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri. """;;;
7,12,All About Mormons,41736,Stan,But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa. ;;;

"7,12,All About Mormons,41778,Stan,""No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up.

"17,6,Ginger Cow,77946,Stan,""Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too. """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,77948,Stan,""...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much? """;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,77950,Stan,You like... how they smell? How they taste? ;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,77952,Stan,They're really that good? ;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,77954,Stan,Should I try them? ;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,77962,Stan,""...Kyle, maybe you should get some help. """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,77965,Stan,""I don't get it, Kenny. """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,77967,Stan,""Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head. """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,77990,Stan,""Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world. """;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,77995,Stan,Hey Kyle. ;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,77997,Stan,""Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop. """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,77999,Stan,""If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it. """;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,78001,Stan,All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else! ;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,78003,Stan,See? You sound like a dick. ;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,78005,Stan,""Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick. """;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,78008,Stan,I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on. ;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,78010,Stan,""This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this! """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,78020,Stan,""Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been [Stan's phone rings] So- sorry, hang on. [pulls the phone out of his jacket pocket and answers it.] Hello? """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,78022,Stan,""No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth! """;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,78024,Stan,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,78027,Stan,""Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle! """;;;
"17,6,Ginger Cow,78029,Stan,""You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all """"Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"""" """;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,78031,Stan,You should apologize to Kenny too. ;;;
17,6,Ginger Cow,78035,Stan,The red cow... I saw it too. It came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle. ;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78076,Stan,[stands on his chair] It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have? ;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78093,Stan,The House of Greyhawk? ;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78139,Stan,I like the PS4's controller better. ;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78141,Stan,""[tears welling up] The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because... [gets mad] because that's how XBox people are. """;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78143,Stan,""[determined] If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside. """;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78208,Stan,""We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s? """;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78212,Stan,Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall! ;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78214,Stan,""No, you can't do that! """;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78216,Stan,""Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS. """;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78218,Stan,Exactly! ;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78220,Stan,""...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in! """;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78249,Stan,And who do we have on our side? ;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78251,Stan,Did you ask the Vamp kids? ;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78253,Stan,""[walks towards the tent's entrance] There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. [looks at the campfire outside, around which sit Tweek and two other boys] """;;;
17,7,Black Friday,78257,Stan,So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest? ;;;
"17,7,Black Friday,78286,Stan,""When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own! [the army is shown, and it includes the Goths, the Vamps, the handicapped kids, and some first graders. The house behind them only has one story, and it looks run down. A security grill is falling off one of the windows and the fence is in tatters. The army cheers for itself] I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided. [more cheering. A familiar figure sits on a throne...] Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! [he turns around and unsheathes his sword, raising it to honor the new leader]All hail the Princess! [points the sword at her, and more cheering follows. Princess Kenny, Lady McCormick, has arrived] """;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78445,Stan,Let them pass! [the PS4 army makes way for the XBox army. Cartman is carried over to Kenny's throne] ;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78447,Stan,[translating] The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose. [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig] ;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78450,Stan,""The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it. """;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78453,Stan,The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian. ;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78456,Stan,What I started? How dare you! ;;;
"17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78458,Stan,""I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing! """;;;
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78460,Stan,The gods will find us a way! ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78568,Stan,""Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here. [points to the location] Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. [points to a location outside cardboard Red Robin] """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78571,Stan,The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts. ;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78573,Stan,I have no idea. ;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78575,Stan,Yes? ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78577,Stan,""What? [moments later, outside, Stan walks towards Cartman as the two armies face each other] """;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78584,Stan,""So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. [turns around and walks away] """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78589,Stan,And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again? ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78591,Stan,""[turns around] Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. [as he walks away with Jimmy and Craig, the camera reveals that Kyle had his fingers on the hand behind his back crossed during the swear.] """;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78616,Stan,""Yeah, sure, what about it? """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78618,Stan,Why? ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78620,Stan,""Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s. """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78626,Stan,Who is that? ;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78632,Stan,Did Kyle know about this? ;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78634,Stan,Did Kyle know about this?! ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78669,Stan,""[startled out of his sleep] Huh? Hello? Who is that? [next to him is a glass of milk, a sandwich with a bite in it, and a tin cup] """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78671,Stan,Get out of here! ;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78673,Stan,You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had. ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78675,Stan,""[stands and turns to address Kyle] I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle! """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78677,Stan,...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity. ;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78679,Stan,You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again. ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78681,Stan,""Get out of here! I'm done with you! [grabs the tin cup and raps it against his bedroom 'jail cell' door as in classic prison movies] Mom! Mom! [Kyle stands up straight] Get him out of here! [Sharon arrives, and Kyle back away from the door] Get him out! [Kyle leaves] """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78732,Stan,We're done with betrayals! It's time to put an end to this! ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78740,Stan,""I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block. [stops between the two presidents] Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad? [throws his sword at the Sony president] Then you fucking fight! """;;;
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78762,Stan,[flatly] Yay. ;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78774,Stan,""Yes, it is. """;;;
"17,9,Titties and Dragons,78780,Stan,""Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games? """;;;

17,10,The Hobbit,78899,Stan,She looks pretty hot here. ;;;

"17,10,The Hobbit,78962,Stan,""A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are. """;;;
"17,10,The Hobbit,78964,Stan,""Wendy, why is it such a big deal? """;;;

23,7,Board Girls,93607,Stan,What? Who says? ;;;
"23,7,Board Girls,93609,Stan,""Well, who made up that stupid rule? """;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93716,Stan,""Dude, Kyle, why are you talking about all this? """;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93723,Stan,""Yeah, he wants it. """;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93735,Stan,""Dude, you realize we won't get that game 'till Christmas. We could be playing it tomorrow. """;;;
23,8,Turd Burglars,93739,Stan,She's in. Kyle's mom just squatted in the toilet. [gets off his perch and walks over to Cartman] ;;;
23,8,Turd Burglars,93745,Stan,You think she'll poop a big enough log? [Kyle appears on the steps behind them.] ;;;
23,8,Turd Burglars,93794,Stan,How can answer that to which we have no knowledge? ;;;
23,8,Turd Burglars,93799,Stan,You want us to steal some of Kyle's mom's poop for you? ;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93815,Stan,""Yes, we do understand. We just... well, since you're his publicist. we thought that... you could give Mr. Brady our message. [begins crying] """;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93818,Stan,""Well if Mr. Brady could just, you know, have Kenny stay over at his house for a night. """;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93848,Stan,""[thinking, """"People just keep looking at me like I'm supposed to say something.""""] """;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93863,Stan,""So, you're all here to meet Tom Brady too? """;;;
"23,8,Turd Burglars,93874,Stan,""Kyle, dude, what are you doing here? [Kyle moves forward] """;;;
23,9,Basic Cable,93914,Stan,About what? ;;;
23,9,Basic Cable,94071,Stan,PC Babies? What the hell is this? [The four are at Jimmy's house with Clyde]  ;;;
23,9,Basic Cable,94085,Stan,What do you mean? This isn't just happening here? ;;;
23,9,Basic Cable,94089,Stan,Let's just hurry and get to Tolkien's house! ;;;
"23,9,Basic Cable,94109,Stan,""Uh, my name's Stan Marsh. [Kyle and Kenny introduce themselves] """;;;
"23,9,Basic Cable,94112,Stan,""Well, it looks like nobody's streaming shows tonight. Sorry, Sophie. """;;;

"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94382,Stan,""I'm, I'm here. """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94411,Stan,It's not school! It's a freakin' joke. We're not even learning anything. ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94413,Stan,""No, I'm fine, Mom! You know, I'm strong. I'm just worried about how this is all affecting weaker kids like, you know, like Butters. """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94419,Stan,""Yeah, Uncle Jimbo. """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94428,Stan,""Wow, that's great! """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94451,Stan,""If they're letting us go back to school, then soon we can get back to everything! I mean, doesn't this mean things are finally going back to normal? Dad? """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94513,Stan,Oh cool! Turn it up! ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94516,Stan,They think they're about to find the vaccine. ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94529,Stan,""What's a pangolin, Mom? """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94531,Stan,""Do you know what a pangolin is, Dad? """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94577,Stan,""Uh, we were there, and Token was actually taken to the hospital because you guys shot him. """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94580,Stan,That doesn't make any sense! ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94615,Stan,""[notices the officers moving towards Butters] Butters, Butters, you gotta calm down. """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94631,Stan,""Kyle, I need to talk to you. """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94633,Stan,I'm really worried. About Butters. I think he's sick. ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94635,Stan,""No! It's all the other stuff. The isolation and the uncertainty. [put his hands in his jacket pockets and wanders off] I'm just really worried what all the stuff around COVID is doing to some kids. You know, not every kid is like us. There's some kids who really can't take it anymore. """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94637,Stan,[getting emotional] And what if he's not? What if Butters is actually starting to lose his mind? What if he feels his body shutting down right now? ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94639,Stan,It's time for us to ask for help. From someone who has more authority at this school than these cops. ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94647,Stan,""Uh, hi, it's Stan Marsh. """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94649,Stan,""I'm sorry. We had to get your attention. Listen, we're being kept at the school, and one of the students here is really sick. """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94651,Stan,""Nono, Mr. President, please! You gotta come back to South Park. Our teachers are shooting people. Everyone's arguing and, and there's a facility outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine! You might be able to stop the pandemic. """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94653,Stan,...Huh? ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94655,Stan,But the pandemic isn't just killing Mexicans. ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94657,Stan,You're just gonna sit there and not do anything?! ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94659,Stan,God dammit! ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94702,Stan,Butters. Butters! ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94704,Stan,Don't worry. I'm going to save you! ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94706,Stan,""Guys, guys! [claps. The kids begin to stir] """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94708,Stan,""Shhh. You guys, we have to get Butters out of here. """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94710,Stan,No! We have to get him out of here! Now! We need to take him... to Build-A-Bear. ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94712,Stan,He has to go out and do something normal! ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94714,Stan,""We can't wait around and wait for people to figure things out, okay?! It's not gonna happen! They just keep taking everything from him and saying it's for his own good! But who's to say he can't go out and have a little goddamn fun?! If we want things to go back to normal, then we just gotta go do it! """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94716,Stan,""They're just gonna be making more restrictions, and more rules, and who's gonna fight to go back to the way things were? """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94718,Stan,""We can make things normal for Butters again, and make school the way it was! """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94720,Stan,""Wait, what? No, in a class, with real teachers! """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94722,Stan,""I'm talking about normal, like back in March. What normal are you talking about? """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94724,Stan,Look it doesn't matter. We just gotta break the fuck out of here. ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94750,Stan,""Okay, all clear! Come on! Go go go! [Butters is lying down in a small wagon, the other three wheel him down the sidewalk] All right, you ready to have some fun, Butters? """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94753,Stan,""Shit shit, get back, back, back, back, back! [they hide in Parking Lot A. Death rides by and they come back out] Okay, all good. Come on. [They reach a plaza] """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94755,Stan,""Butters, Butters. [wakes Butters up] Look! [Butters looks up and sees Build-A-Bear Workshop] """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94757,Stan,""Yeah, it's real. Come on! We got an appointment! [helps Butters out of the wagon. They reach the entrance, only to see James the shopkeeper closing the shop.] Oh, uh hey, excuse me. We had an appointment. """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94759,Stan,But I called. Y-you said you were open today for appointments. ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94762,Stan,""Ple-hease, my friend has to build a bear. """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94764,Stan,""Ohoh, just give us one minute! """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94767,Stan,We can't go. ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94769,Stan,We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to break in. ;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94771,Stan,And then build him a bear. ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94773,Stan,""If we have to, yes! """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94775,Stan,I don't care! I'm not following the rules anymore! ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94785,Stan,""Here we are, Butters! Look! You made it! """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94787,Stan,""No, it's not a dream! We are really here, and we are going to build you a bear! Which one you want? You want the panda? You want the Bronco koala? """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94789,Stan,""Caballero Grizzly. [gets the materials needed] Okay, we just find the sh-shell and the uh, the outfit. """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94791,Stan,""It's gonna fucking work! Just fucking shut up! [take the shell to a stuffer] Okay! Okay, Butters. Look! [starts the machine] We're gonna put the stuffing in! """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94793,Stan,""Okay, uh, um... [starts pressing buttons. All of a sudden, the shell is pumped full of cotton and explodes] """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94795,Stan,It's okay! We can start over! We can start over! There'a do-over machine right over there! Look! [walks over to a shredder and drops the mangled bear in. The shredder has a window through which the bear is seen being destroyed.] ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94805,Stan,""God dammit! [looks out the window and sees Death there. Stan tries one more time to fill the shell, but the gust of air knocks him to the ground. Stan gets right back up to try again] """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94807,Stan,""No, Kyle, we can't let Butters down! """;;;
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94811,Stan,No! I'm not giving up! ;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94822,Stan,""Cartman, no! [follows Cartman inside with Kyle. Cartman prepares to drop the pangolin into the store's shredder] Don't do it, Cartman! That thing is our only chance! """;;;
"24,1,The Pandemic Special,94824,Stan,""You guys were right, okay? This hasn't been about Butters. I've been acting like this because I can't take these shutdowns anymore, and I'm scared what it's doing to me! I'm looking for whom to blame.

[Cartman looks at him] I wanted to see that I could go out in the world and do things that I used to do, but I can't. I'm not any better, and I don't care any more than anyone else. And I did all this [tears well up in his eyes] because I just want my life back! I just want my life back... [begins to weep silently. Cartman's look softens. He looks at the shredder, at the boys, then steps down from the shredder, carries the pangolin out of the store, and gives it to the Chief Scientist] """;;;

"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95007,Stan,""Yeah, we assist senior citizens who need the vaccine, but then need help getting to the right place. """;;;

"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95019,Stan,""Just pay her, Cartman. """;;;

24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95092,Stan,[angry] What the hell did I do?! ;;;
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95126,Stan,[walking up to Kyle] I don't see anybody. I think we're safe here until school starts in the morning. ;;;
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95130,Stan,[turns to look at Cartman] What? ;;;
"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95141,Stan,""I say we take the vaccines ourselves. I mean, why are us kids last? This whole pandemic has been about doing what's best for adults. Maybe for the broship we do what's best for us. """;;;
"24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95179,Stan,""Kyle? [Kyle, startled, drops the can of Cactus Cooler and tries to hide the vaccine] What are you doing? """;;;
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95181,Stan,[walking towards Kyle] So then why are you replacing some of the vaccines with Cactus Cooler? ;;;
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95183,Stan,[angry] I don't want my mom to die either! I can't believe that you would lie to me. That you would hide shit from me. ;;;

24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95188,Stan,[walking towards Kyle] I'm just gonna try and pretend this didn't happen. But only because it's what's best for Kenny. [he turns and walks away] ;;;
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95191,Stan,I just want this over with. Let's get these stupid things to the teachers and go home. ;;;

24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95296,Stan,A week is a long time for Kenny to be with one person. ;;;

"25,2,The Big Fix,95639,Stan,""Dude... my head is reeling, you're not gonna believe this. """;;;
25,2,The Big Fix,95641,Stan,Token's name isn't Token. It's Tolkien. ;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95643,Stan,""No, no, no, no. He's named after the guy who wrote The Hobbit and stuff! """;;;
25,2,The Big Fix,95645,Stan,[horrified] You knew it was Tolkien like the writer. ;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95647,Stan,""No, no, no! No, no, no, no! I distinctly remember Cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it T-O-K-E-N. """;;;

"25,2,The Big Fix,95652,Stan,""Dude, Cartman, did you know that Tolkien is named after J.R.R. Tolkien? """;;;

25,2,The Big Fix,95682,Stan,I kinda wanted to talk about something in private. ;;;
25,2,The Big Fix,95684,Stan,I think... I might be horribly racist.[pause] ;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95686,Stan,""So... there's this kid at my school, and... he's black. And his parents named him after the guy that wrote Lord of the Rings. """;;;

"25,2,The Big Fix,95702,Stan,""Okay, what should I read? """;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95716,Stan,""Guys... lately I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I've had to ask myself hard questions, because for a long time now, I've misinterpreted some amazing writing. I've done a lot of reading... And I've learned why Sauron built the black gate of Mordor across the path of Cirith Grogor, which led into the enclosed plain of Udun. I've learned that the Mouth of Sauron was once a man, who commanded the armies of Gorgoroth and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King. """;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95718,Stan,""I firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books.

Tolkien? """;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95722,Stan,""[glares] My point is, we need to petition the school to make Tolkien required reading. To better understand our classmate. I think maybe we all haven't done enough to make sure than Tolkien doesn't feel isolated and left out. """;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95724,Stan,""Not yet, Token. Just another couple minutes. """;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95726,Stan,""[pause] Just a couple minutes, bro. [Tolkien leaves, closing the door] """;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95746,Stan,""Sup, guys. You know, I've done a lot of reading lately. And I'd like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today J.R.R. Tolkien appreciation day! [the crowd is silent] These books go so much deeper than the Hollywood movies. And we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture. In fact, how many of you knew that our classmate Tolkien was named after J.R.R. Tolkien? [every audience member raises their hand] But you don't know that Lord of the Rings was an analogy for World War II, did you?! And I'll bet you didn't know that there was originally 19 Rings of Power that were forged by Celebrimbor! So there's much we need to understand. And so I would like to bring up the man himself.

"25,2,The Big Fix,95750,Stan,""Nope. Not any better, Mom. """;;;
"25,2,The Big Fix,95752,Stan,""Tolkien is... here? [he walks downstairs into the living room] Hey, Tol-kien. """;;;

"25,2,The Big Fix,95766,Stan,""Oh, my God, this is great! [he grabs Tolkien's hands and takes him into the kitchen] Mom, Dad, guess what?! Tolkien's family bought the farm across the street! We're neighbors! """;;;
