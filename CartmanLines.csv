1,3,Volcano,1072,Cartman,Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt? 
1,3,Volcano,1074,Cartman,"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top. "
1,3,Volcano,1076,Cartman,"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body. "
1,3,Volcano,1078,Cartman,"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has... "
1,3,Volcano,1081,Cartman,No! A piece of celery. 
1,3,Volcano,1083,Cartman,"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy. "
1,3,Volcano,1085,Cartman,"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink. "

1,3,Volcano,1096,Cartman,Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell! 
1,3,Volcano,1100,Cartman,They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow! 
1,3,Volcano,1152,Cartman,"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg. "
1,3,Volcano,1158,Cartman,[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared. 
1,3,Volcano,1161,Cartman,Holy crap! 
1,3,Volcano,1164,Cartman,What the hell is wrong with you people?! 
1,3,Volcano,1167,Cartman,"Hey, wait, aah! "

1,3,Volcano,1247,Cartman,Help! 
1,3,Volcano,1250,Cartman,What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?! 
1,3,Volcano,1307,Cartman,"Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.] "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1316,Cartman,"Eh. You're making me sick, dude. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1318,Cartman,No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1321,Cartman,"Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1324,Cartman,I'll put a dollar on Sylvester. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1329,Cartman,"Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1333,Cartman,"Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1335,Cartman,That dog is a gay homosexual. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1343,Cartman, Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.   
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1348,Cartman,What's homecoming?

1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1391,Cartman,Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1401,Cartman,"...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1403,Cartman,"Ah, dammit! "

1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1415,Cartman,That's not fair! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1417,Cartman,Stupid puppet. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1430,Cartman,You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1432,Cartman,"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1437,Cartman,"Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1448,Cartman,He still looks pretty gay to me. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1480,Cartman,There he goes! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1487,Cartman,"No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1508,Cartman,"Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1565,Cartman,Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!

1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1811,Cartman,"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. "

1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1841,Cartman,"I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"" "

1,6,Death,2353,Cartman,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it! "
1,6,Death,2355,Cartman,"[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been? "
1,6,Death,2381,Cartman,What? 
1,6,Death,2395,Cartman,"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom! "

1,7,Pinkeye,2908,Cartman,You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?! 
1,7,Pinkeye,2910,Cartman,[In a mocking voice.] Wookies don't live on Endor. 
1,7,Pinkeye,2912,Cartman,What?! What did you say? 
1,7,Pinkeye,2934,Cartman,"Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? [As Kenny.] No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. [As himself.] Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2942,Cartman,Eating Kenny's pudding. 
1,7,Pinkeye,2951,Cartman,"Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2953,Cartman,"That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool. "

1,7,Pinkeye,2989,Cartman,"Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2991,Cartman,Hey Chef. 
1,7,Pinkeye,2994,Cartman,"Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh? "
1,7,Pinkeye,2999,Cartman,What is that? 
1,7,Pinkeye,3006,Cartman,Who? 
1,7,Pinkeye,3042,Cartman,"Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3044,Cartman,Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3046,Cartman,"Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3048,Cartman,"God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!! "

1,7,Pinkeye,3062,Cartman,"Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3065,Cartman,"Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3067,Cartman,"I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3069,Cartman,"I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate. "

1,7,Pinkeye,3117,Cartman,"Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3121,Cartman,"You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3152,Cartman,Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3159,Cartman,Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.

1,7,Pinkeye,3177,Cartman,I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3186,Cartman,"Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3188,Cartman,Aaah! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3195,Cartman,It was Kyle. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3199,Cartman,"Remember candy, focus on the candy. "

1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3468,Cartman,Ahh! 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3482,Cartman,"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3484,Cartman,Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too? 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3486,Cartman,"You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers. "

1,10,Damien,4255,Cartman,"Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan... "
1,10,Damien,4257,Cartman,They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend. 
1,10,Damien,4259,Cartman,"Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... "
1,10,Damien,4261,Cartman,That's right. 
1,10,Damien,4263,Cartman,That's ri-aayy. 
1,10,Damien,4265,Cartman,"[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember! "
1,10,Damien,4267,Cartman,I shoved it up my ass! 
1,10,Damien,4269,Cartman,"Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap! "
1,10,Damien,4271,Cartman,"Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde... "
1,10,Damien,4273,Cartman,"No, my birthday isn't until Saturday. "
1,10,Damien,4275,Cartman,Eeeeeeh! 
1,10,Damien,4291,Cartman,"Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party? "
1,10,Damien,4293,Cartman,"Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder? "
1,10,Damien,4296,Cartman,Byah. Oof! 
1,10,Damien,4301,Cartman,[Getting up off the floor.] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! 
1,10,Damien,4306,Cartman,"Eheh. [Taunting.] You got in trouble, you got in trouble. "
1,10,Damien,4310,Cartman,Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday. 
1,10,Damien,4313,Cartman,"Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see? "
1,10,Damien,4316,Cartman,"Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then. "
1,10,Damien,4318,Cartman,"Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. "
1,10,Damien,4321,Cartman,"Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo! "
1,10,Damien,4325,Cartman,"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two. "
1,10,Damien,4327,Cartman,Eeyy! 
1,10,Damien,4344,Cartman,"Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man! "
1,10,Damien,4394,Cartman,"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... "
1,10,Damien,4440,Cartman,"Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday! "
1,10,Damien,4443,Cartman,Cartman's birthday! 
1,10,Damien,4445,Cartman,"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel. "
1,10,Damien,4447,Cartman,"Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?! "
1,10,Damien,4455,Cartman,"Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish. "
1,10,Damien,4509,Cartman,"[Sees Damien coming.] Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch! "
1,10,Damien,4512,Cartman,"[Farts and moves away.] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! "
1,10,Damien,4559,Cartman,"You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents? "
1,10,Damien,4573,Cartman,"Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef. "
1,10,Damien,4598,Cartman,Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here? 
1,10,Damien,4616,Cartman,Yeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased] 
1,10,Damien,4620,Cartman,"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves.] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[She leaves.] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?! [Thumps the table in anger.] "
1,10,Damien,4622,Cartman,You son of a bitch! [Lunges towards Kyle.] 
1,10,Damien,4624,Cartman,"You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can't make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap! [Slapping him around by now.] "
1,10,Damien,4626,Cartman,I hate you! I want you to die! Die!! 
1,10,Damien,4627,Cartman,Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!! 
1,10,Damien,4630,Cartman,That's it! Party is over! 
1,10,Damien,4632,Cartman,Everybody go home! 
1,10,Damien,4634,Cartman,"Get the hell out, I said! The party's over! Get out goddammt!! "
1,10,Damien,4638,Cartman,Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
1,10,Damien,4726,Cartman,Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.

1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4803,Cartman,"She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4806,Cartman,Until you puked on her.

1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4957,Cartman,"Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4961,Cartman,"Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4964,Cartman,"Oh, hi, Chef. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4986,Cartman,"You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4989,Cartman,"I am, too! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5000,Cartman,My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5007,Cartman,This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5027,Cartman,I'm a bigger lesbian than you! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5035,Cartman,"Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John. "

1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5257,Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5259,Cartman,"Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5261,Cartman,"Okay, ready? I'll go first. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5264,Cartman,"Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5266,Cartman," Day is never finished, Massa got me working...   Oh, look, I found another one.  "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5268,Cartman,"Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! "

1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5286,Cartman,"I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5289,Cartman,"[To Kyle.] Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5295,Cartman,"...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5297,Cartman,"Screw you, triangle thief! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5301,Cartman,Eeyy!

1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5359,Cartman,"No! I found it, he stole it! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5361,Cartman,"I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5375,Cartman,Na-ah! She's being a total bitch! 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5414,Cartman,"[Revealing himself.] You scared the crap out of me, Ike! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5416,Cartman,"I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back? "

2,12,Clubhouses,11740,Cartman,"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11742,Cartman,"No, Kenny. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11744,Cartman,"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11746,Cartman,Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11748,Cartman,"[Sliding into a whine.] But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11750,Cartman,"Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11753,Cartman,And stop your bitchin'! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11770,Cartman,"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11772,Cartman,"We'll see about that. [To Kenny.] Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11801,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11854,Cartman,"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11856,Cartman,"Oh, man! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11858,Cartman,"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11860,Cartman,"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11862,Cartman,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11864,Cartman,"Mom, can I watch American Gladiators? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11914,Cartman,What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11916,Cartman,"Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11921,Cartman,[Amazed.] Holy crap! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11923,Cartman,Behold! The Ewok Village 2000! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11925,Cartman,[Enunciating properly.] Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? [Rubs his stomach.] 
2,12,Clubhouses,11928,Cartman,"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11930,Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11934,Cartman,"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11952,Cartman,"Ahaw, that's weak. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11954,Cartman,That's killer. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11956,Cartman,That's totally weak! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11958,Cartman,Sweet. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11960,Cartman,"Killer weak, sweet! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11964,Cartman,"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"" "
2,12,Clubhouses,12067,Cartman,"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts! "
2,12,Clubhouses,12072,Cartman,"[Voice shaking.] Coming, Mom. [To the girls.] Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick! "
2,12,Clubhouses,12076,Cartman,Who the hell are you?! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12078,Cartman,How many people? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12126,Cartman,Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12128,Cartman,This is bullcrap! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12131,Cartman,"This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse! "
2,12,Clubhouses,12137,Cartman,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! "
2,13,Cow Days,12247,Cartman,Wwow! 
2,13,Cow Days,12249,Cartman,"[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play? "

2,13,Cow Days,12314,Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over. "
2,13,Cow Days,12316,Cartman,I'm right!

2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13761,Cartman,"Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13763,Cartman,"[not pleased] Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! [lifts it out] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13765,Cartman,"[really upset] Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13775,Cartman,I can't believe I got a stupid shirt! [he didn't have to wear it...] The holidays are bullcrap! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13781,Cartman,"[flatly] Hi, cousin Elvin. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13789,Cartman,Yup! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13795,Cartman,Amen. [his feelings exactly] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13799,Cartman,Bad Jimmy! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13811,Cartman,"Whatever it is, it's getting closer. [Stan pinches him] Ow! What the hell was that for! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13813,Cartman,Ow! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13815,Cartman,"Yuhwell, you're not dreaming! [Kenny flies at him with a punch] Ey! Cut the crap! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13817,Cartman,Uncle Howard! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13819,Cartman,"Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13822,Cartman,"Wow, cool! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13824,Cartman,Okay. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13826,Cartman,Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13837,Cartman,[waking] What? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13839,Cartman,"[putting his coat on over his BEEFCAKE muscle shirt] All right, keeps your pants on. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13841,Cartman,[follows the boys up the stairs] Okay. [puts on his cap] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13844,Cartman,Can somebody drive us to the mall? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13847,Cartman,"[insistent] Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13849,Cartman,"[pops up in front of Stinky] Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13851,Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13853,Cartman,[leaves grumbling] Damn his Goddamned authorituh! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13862,Cartman,I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13864,Cartman,All right. Give me $10. [she reaches into her purse and gives it to him] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13872,Cartman,[coming down the stairs with his friends and Elvin] My family sucks ass! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13875,Cartman,Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. [hands the bag to Howard] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13881,Cartman,"My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13889,Cartman,"Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. [walks away] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13910,Cartman,"How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. [a display is seen of Mr. Hankey caps, T-shirts, cups, figurines, and posters] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13912,Cartman,And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13914,Cartman,"So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13919,Cartman,"Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin. [Elvin looks at his hands and sees nothing to lick, then begins to cry] God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin! [grabs a stick and whacks him on the back of the head. Elvin is now catatonic, but manages a blink] No, Elvin, bad Elvin! [seeing that Elvin is not responding, he looks around] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13962,Cartman,[the boys regroup] I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13969,Cartman,"Oh, uh that's pretty cool. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13978,Cartman,"[outside, falling behind with Elvin] Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. [the officers follow] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13981,Cartman,Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13998,Cartman,Lock the door! [Terrance and Phillip are on] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14100,Cartman,"See ya, Uncle Howard. [mad] Thanks for being such a great role model for me. [very softly] Piece of crap. "
2,17,Gnomes,14120,Cartman,"Yeah, that's fine. "
2,17,Gnomes,14166,Cartman,"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond. "
2,17,Gnomes,14177,Cartman,"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go. "
2,17,Gnomes,14222,Cartman,"Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny? "
2,17,Gnomes,14224,Cartman,"Heheh, you suck, Kenny. "
2,17,Gnomes,14234,Cartman,"[running around the rim of a throw rug like an Olympian] You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that. "
2,17,Gnomes,14238,Cartman,"[rushing up] Ey, let me have some grounds. [take some, swallows, and throws up] "
2,17,Gnomes,14250,Cartman,No...more...coffee. Blech. [the vomit falls back on him and on the ground] 
2,17,Gnomes,14271,Cartman,"[steps forward] What will become of the endeavoring American family?"" "
2,17,Gnomes,14280,Cartman,Neither did we. 
2,17,Gnomes,14318,Cartman,"[pissed] Aw, man, this sucks! "
2,17,Gnomes,14366,Cartman,This guy sucks ass! 
2,17,Gnomes,14375,Cartman,[screen left to screen right] I believe in the family-owned enterprise. 
2,17,Gnomes,14414,Cartman,What now? 
2,17,Gnomes,14421,Cartman,Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time? 
2,17,Gnomes,14425,Cartman,"[""until we have underpants""] I think my mom is a corporation. "
2,17,Gnomes,14434,Cartman,"[""until we have underpants""] Well, I'll be damned. "
2,17,Gnomes,14438,Cartman,Bad! [whacks the gnome with a stick] 
2,17,Gnomes,14440,Cartman,What?! 
2,17,Gnomes,14442,Cartman,"Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. [whacks him again] "
2,17,Gnomes,14444,Cartman,What?! [advances] 
2,17,Gnomes,14446,Cartman,"Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy! "
2,17,Gnomes,14448,Cartman,Ey! 
2,17,Gnomes,14457,Cartman,"[muttering] Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome. "
2,17,Gnomes,14460,Cartman,"Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house? "
2,17,Gnomes,14462,Cartman,"Oh, your pussy village? "
2,17,Gnomes,14465,Cartman,[the boys look at him] I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker. 
2,17,Gnomes,14476,Cartman,"[exhales] No it isn't, you guys! "
2,17,Gnomes,14478,Cartman,So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal? 
2,17,Gnomes,14487,Cartman,"Oh, I get it. "
2,17,Gnomes,14539,Cartman,I love you guys. [more laughter] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14551,Cartman,I told you guys. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14557,Cartman,"[with Aussie accent] There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14559,Cartman,"[advancing towards Kyle] Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14561,Cartman,"Come 'ere, crocky. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14568,Cartman,"Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. [backs up] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14570,Cartman,"Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! [turns around and walks off] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14574,Cartman,"I'm right here, Kyle. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14576,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14580,Cartman,"[moves away] Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14585,Cartman,"Screw you, hippie! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14593,Cartman,"Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14597,Cartman,"Really? [to Kenny] Hey, there's a frozen guy down there. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14599,Cartman,"Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about ""Greased Lightning."" [no response] You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the- "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14601,Cartman,"Aww, screw you guys anyway! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14605,Cartman,For what? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14618,Cartman,"I think we're almost there, you guys. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14634,Cartman,"Yeah, like the kid with the wallet. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14693,Cartman,"Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14732,Cartman,Sweet. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14734,Cartman,Killer. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14737,Cartman,Fine. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14764,Cartman,"Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14864,Cartman,"Well, I don't see any crocs out here. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14866,Cartman,"[walks over to a cat nearby] Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got! [the cat leaps up and scratches his face] Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14869,Cartman,You son of a bitch cat! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14889,Cartman,"Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14892,Cartman,"He might have been, by crikey. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14895,Cartman,Wow! Kick ass! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14919,Cartman,"Yeah, I think the same thing. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14923,Cartman,"Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14929,Cartman,I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14983,Cartman,"They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15017,Cartman,"[still hunting] Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15020,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my- [turns left and goes Aussie] Aha! There's a king croc right there! [a cow grazing on a tiny patch of grass. Cartman sneaks up] And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its- "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15023,Cartman,"Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15029,Cartman,Okay. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15038,Cartman,What if you don't have any rhythm? 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15040,Cartman,"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15045,Cartman,"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. [the other kids laugh] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15058,Cartman,"Hey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15070,Cartman,"[drops down and pleads] Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15076,Cartman,"[as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15081,Cartman,Whoopee. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15083,Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15093,Cartman,[hushed] The nightmare begins. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15096,Cartman,"Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15098,Cartman,"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15100,Cartman,"[sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15103,Cartman,"Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15106,Cartman,Okay. [pretends] Cleek! [grins] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15110,Cartman,"[rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15112,Cartman,"[covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15116,Cartman,"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15118,Cartman,Why? 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15120,Cartman,Eh-heheh! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15144,Cartman,I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15159,Cartman,"[impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We hear this a million times back up in the States. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15162,Cartman,[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15164,Cartman,"[stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15166,Cartman,[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15168,Cartman,[throws the branch at the sloth] Re’spect my authoritah! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15174,Cartman,"[fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15181,Cartman,"He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15185,Cartman,"Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15190,Cartman,"[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15238,Cartman,"[moves forward] Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. [the soldier listens] We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. [rubs his belly] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15240,Cartman,Y taco. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15242,Cartman,Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15283,Cartman,[turns and walks back the way they came] This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15285,Cartman,I'm going this way! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15287,Cartman,"[stops] Look: you can stay over nyah [gestures towards her], but I'm going over nyah. [Gestures away from her] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15289,Cartman,"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! [gestures forward and backward] Screw you guys, I'ma going home. [walks away] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15292,Cartman,God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- [finds himself at a clearing full of bulldozers moving wood around] Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! [rushes in] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15298,Cartman,[reaches the foreman] Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15300,Cartman,"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15302,Cartman,Food! I have to have food! [falls on his face] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15304,Cartman,[lifts his head] Chicken wings. [drops it] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15306,Cartman,[lifts his head] Medium spicy. [drops it] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15353,Cartman,[arriving] Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15399,Cartman,"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15401,Cartman,"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't- "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15405,Cartman,What the hell happened to him? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15484,Cartman,I'm gonna be Jesus! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15486,Cartman,"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15488,Cartman,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! [gestures his intent.] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15490,Cartman,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. [gestures again, and again] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15492,Cartman,"[retorts] Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15502,Cartman,"This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home. [walks off] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15511,Cartman,"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15515,Cartman,"[now carrying the cross] This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15517,Cartman,Peter! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15519,Cartman,"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15535,Cartman,Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15537,Cartman,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. [Stan replaces Cartman's cap with the crown] So I guess it's cool. [Stan returns to the pulpit] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15539,Cartman,"[on his way out the door] Hi, mom. [Stan leaves the pulpit and the priest returns] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15544,Cartman,"Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15546,Cartman,Up your ass with broken glass! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15550,Cartman,"Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! [they stop and turn] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15553,Cartman,"Well, get me down from here! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15555,Cartman,What?! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15558,Cartman,"Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home! [looks around] Okay, I'm getting pissed now! [struggles to get loose, but doesn't get anywhere] God! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15574,Cartman,"[wakes up] Hey, there you guys are! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15576,Cartman,You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15578,Cartman,"You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15580,Cartman,...Really? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15582,Cartman,"[watches them leave] ...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet! [to himself] Dude, superpowers are sweet. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15614,Cartman,"[vultures hover above him] You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15616,Cartman,Officer Barbrady! [Barbrady looks up to see Cartman on the cross and says nothing for a while] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15618,Cartman,"Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch! [to himself] Huh, I'm gonna die up here. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15644,Cartman,"You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15646,Cartman,"Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen. [prepares for a bit of ventriloquism] Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15648,Cartman,"[still in falsetto] Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15650,Cartman,"You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15654,Cartman,"Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my ""I hate Stan and Kyle"" song?! Ahem. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15655,Cartman, I hate Stan and Kyle I seriously hate Stan and Kyle...   
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15669,Cartman,"[whispering, hoping...] Hey you guys. Seriously. [Chef walks into view] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15671,Cartman,Chef! Chef! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15673,Cartman,"Just get me down from here! [Chef does] Oh, finally! My arms are killing me! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15676,Cartman,"Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15678,Cartman,What? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15680,Cartman,What?! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15682,Cartman,"[waking up] Oh, damnit! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15772,Cartman,Hello-o. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15793,Cartman,"[in a slight falsetto] Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15795,Cartman,Get me down from here! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15797,Cartman,"[who is now incredibly thin] Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts! "
3,3,The Succubus,15800,Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave? "
3,3,The Succubus,15802,Cartman,But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat. 
3,3,The Succubus,15804,Cartman,"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason. "
3,3,The Succubus,15806,Cartman,[enters the examination room] Weak. [the assistant follows him in to close the door.] 
3,3,The Succubus,15809,Cartman,"[resigned] Hi, Doctor Lout. "
3,3,The Succubus,15811,Cartman,[points his finger at him] Ey! Don't call me a little piggy! 
3,3,The Succubus,15813,Cartman,"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself! "
3,3,The Succubus,15815,Cartman,[turns around and sits] God damn it! 
3,3,The Succubus,15817,Cartman,Yes. 
3,3,The Succubus,15819,Cartman,I am a little piggy. Ey! [the optometrist laughs. Cartman stands up on the chair and pushes the refractor away.] That does it! Mom! 
3,3,The Succubus,15821,Cartman,Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian! 
3,3,The Succubus,15823,Cartman,They look exactly the same. 
3,3,The Succubus,15825,Cartman,"I don't know, two! "
3,3,The Succubus,15827,Cartman,"Uh, one. "
3,3,The Succubus,15829,Cartman,[chooses the cake] Two. 
3,3,The Succubus,15831,Cartman,Ow! I hate you! 
3,3,The Succubus,15838,Cartman,[with very dilated pupils] Hey dudes. 
3,3,The Succubus,15840,Cartman,My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated. 
3,3,The Succubus,15842,Cartman,"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it! "
3,3,The Succubus,15844,Cartman,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do. "
3,3,The Succubus,15846,Cartman,"Hey, yeah! [The four enter the kitchen, but Cartman runs into the entrance and falls on his way in.] Ow! "
3,3,The Succubus,15850,Cartman,"[rubs his eyes] Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy. "
3,3,The Succubus,15862,Cartman,Can I have the yellow with a side of white? 
3,3,The Succubus,15866,Cartman,"I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. [chuckles] "
3,3,The Succubus,15869,Cartman,[runs into the door] Ow! 
3,3,The Succubus,15895,Cartman,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean. "
3,3,The Succubus,15904,Cartman,Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is. 
3,3,The Succubus,15908,Cartman,"Bitch, I hate that bitch! "
3,3,The Succubus,15914,Cartman,"[sits on the chair, his pupils normal again] Stop calling me piggy! "
3,3,The Succubus,15916,Cartman,"So, what does that mean? "
3,3,The Succubus,15918,Cartman,"[seething] All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair [throws a fit] and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands! "
3,3,The Succubus,15920,Cartman,"[after seeing how they look and fit] Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me. "
3,3,The Succubus,15922,Cartman,I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave! 
3,3,The Succubus,15924,Cartman,Ow! Son of a bitch! 
3,3,The Succubus,15927,Cartman,"Hey dudes. [the others study him, then laugh. Cartman's hurt, but jabs] Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha! "
3,3,The Succubus,15929,Cartman,"I can't! They're stapled to my head! [they study him again, then laugh harder.] I hate you guys. "
3,3,The Succubus,15940,Cartman,"[dismissively] Uh, yeah, sure sure. "
3,3,The Succubus,15942,Cartman,Ey! 
3,3,The Succubus,15959,Cartman,"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses. "
3,3,The Succubus,15961,Cartman,Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef! 
3,3,The Succubus,15978,Cartman,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind? "
3,3,The Succubus,16008,Cartman,"Oh, no! "
3,3,The Succubus,16010,Cartman,"Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow. "
3,3,The Succubus,16012,Cartman,But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus! 
3,3,The Succubus,16049,Cartman,Hey! You son of a bitch!

3,3,The Succubus,16075,Cartman,"Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus? "
3,3,The Succubus,16078,Cartman,"Okay. [Liane leaves, and Veronica soon enters] "
3,3,The Succubus,16080,Cartman,"Aaah! It's the succubus! [looks in her direction as the others jump, and Kenny pulls his hood tight] "
3,3,The Succubus,16092,Cartman,What? What happened? 
3,3,The Succubus,16118,Cartman,"You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep. "
3,3,The Succubus,16120,Cartman,"You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. [rolls over] "
3,3,The Succubus,16131,Cartman, [picks up] If we can hold on to the night. We've got to find our way together...   
3,3,The Succubus,16138,Cartman,[rattled] What what what? 
3,3,The Succubus,16140,Cartman,"I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard! "
3,3,The Succubus,16157,Cartman,Okay. [Stan and Kyle leave] 
3,3,The Succubus,16171,Cartman,"Ow! [Veronica reaches Stan and Kyle, but the backwards version of ""A Morning After"" soon plays] "
3,3,The Succubus,16178,Cartman,"Oh no! The tape jammed! [Veronica transforms again, this time tearing through the gown, revealing her huge wings and succubus body. The congregation reacts with groans and screams] "
3,3,The Succubus,16187,Cartman,[pressing every button on the tape player] I can't see anything! 
3,3,The Succubus,16194,Cartman,[presses the right button] Got it! [music resumes] 
3,3,The Succubus,16202,Cartman,What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay? 
3,3,The Succubus,16214,Cartman,"After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again! "
3,3,The Succubus,16216,Cartman,"No, not with my eyes. With these! [takes Kenny's frozen head out of the box to show the eyes] Ha ha ha ha ha ha! "
3,3,The Succubus,16218,Cartman,Eh-sure. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16222,Cartman,"You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":  [plays four notes before each line] I hate you guys. You guys are assholes. Specially Kenny. [the other three glare at him] I hate him the most.   "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16223,Cartman,"Okay now, let's try one all together:  I hate you guys.   Come on, you guys know the words.  Specially Kenny.   "

3,4,Jakovasaurs,16232,Cartman,Well what do I sit on? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16235,Cartman,"[moves away] God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules! [he squats some distance away and begins] Urgh. Come on, now. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16237,Cartman,"Stop, you guys! I can't think! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16239,Cartman,"I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... [a dump is heard] Oh, that did it. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16242,Cartman," Poopin' outside, [a rear shot] Makin' self-serve ice cream For my friends Specially Kenny.   Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves? [a yellow creature peeks out between the trees. It is the one looking at Cartman's rear.]  "

3,4,Jakovasaurs,16326,Cartman,Should I get it? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16328,Cartman,Okay. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16331,Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! [opens the door and screams. An angry jakovasaur glares at him. Cartman backs into the living room] Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16334,Cartman,You mean the other jakovasaur? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16336,Cartman,"[""You're a jakovasaur that's what they call you. ""]"
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16338,Cartman,But the other jakovasaur talked different. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16340,Cartman,"[""I have to call my friends over they're never gonna believe it. ""]"
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16343,Cartman,"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. [the others stay silent, looking at him] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16345,Cartman,"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16348,Cartman,"No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. [the closet door opens and the jakovasaur comes out] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16350,Cartman,"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16352,Cartman,"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny? "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16355,Cartman,We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16357,Cartman,No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16365,Cartman,"[laughing] Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16389,Cartman,"[reading his acceptance speech] ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."" "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16391,Cartman,"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."" "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16396,Cartman,"[walks to the podium and speaks] Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction. "

3,4,Jakovasaurs,16618,Cartman,"[after some study] That's Kenny with branches on his head. [looks again] Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys? "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16620,Cartman,"Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! [drops his notepad and rushes back to town] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16640,Cartman,[arriving and running up the stairs] Jakov! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16642,Cartman,[pounding] Open this door!

3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16672,Cartman,Ooooohh. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16680,Cartman,"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16686,Cartman,Told ya! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16696,Cartman,I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? [cuts out two slabs] 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16699,Cartman,"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. [Craig leafs through some wood scraps, and Tweek approaches a belt sander on the floor] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16701,Cartman,"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16703,Cartman,"Yeah, I'll bet. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16705,Cartman,Five bucks. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16716,Cartman,"Craig, could I talk to you real quick? [Craig flips him off, and Cartman puts his palms up to calm him] Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16718,Cartman,"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16720,Cartman,"I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16722,Cartman,"[blocks his way] No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16742,Cartman,You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16744,Cartman,Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16746,Cartman,"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16759,Cartman,Those sons of bitches! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16781,Cartman,"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16783,Cartman,"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16785,Cartman,"[aloof] Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16787,Cartman,"[hushed] Egh. God damn it! [knocks again, and Craig answers] Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16789,Cartman,"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16791,Cartman,"Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow? "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16793,Cartman,"[being gracious] After Red Racer, of course. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16832,Cartman,"[covers Craig's mouth] However long Craig wants it to last. [the kids laugh] T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16834,Cartman,Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16836,Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! [jumps on him, and they start fighting. Kenny and Stan soon join in, leaving Tweek and Craig looking at them] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16843,Cartman,"When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16845,Cartman,"Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16863,Cartman,"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16866,Cartman,Come on! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16870,Cartman,"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16877,Cartman,"You just hit each other, smack each other around. [Tweek slaps Craig, and Craig slaps Tweek. No effect] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16885,Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16887,Cartman,"[faking fear] Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! [serious] I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16889,Cartman,Fine! [the parties part ways] 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16891,Cartman,"Fine, that's fine! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16920,Cartman,"I'm ready! [comes out, speaks softly] Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. [stops to pull some salt out of a kettle and pats his hands together] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16922,Cartman,Respect my authoritah! [he and Craig engage in pushing each other] 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16924,Cartman,"[turns around to back Craig out of the ring] Dude. Come on, now. Come on. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16930,Cartman,I win! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16932,Cartman,"Hey, maybe. [plants his feet again] "

3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16984,Cartman,"Come on, Craig! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17003,Cartman,'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17042,Cartman,"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17048,Cartman,"Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17054,Cartman,"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17059,Cartman,"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17072,Cartman,I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17074,Cartman,What did you call me? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17076,Cartman,[indignant] That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment! 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17079,Cartman,You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17082,Cartman,"Oh, you did it again! You all heard him! "

3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17092,Cartman,"Th... That is correct, my honor. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17094,Cartman,He talked about having oral sex with my ass. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17096,Cartman,"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. [sniffs, Gerald comforts him] I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. [hides his face in Gerald's coat and begins sobbing] "

The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... [the door opens] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17401,Cartman,"[begging] But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West. "

3,7,Cat Orgy,17439,Cartman,"[huffs] God dammit! [goes for a chair and props it up in front of the refrigerator. As he hops onto the chair, Kitty walks in still pining] Shut up, Kitty! [turns and sees the note on the freezer door, then grabs it and reads it] Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha! [hops off the chair, moves it back to the table, and sits on it. He grabs a telephone] I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! [he picks up the receiver, only to find a familiar voice on the line] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17441,Cartman,"[hangs up] Dammit! [waits for a moment, then picks up the receiver again. Kitty now pines on the stove] "

3,7,Cat Orgy,17454,Cartman,Who the hell are you? 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17457,Cartman,You know this guy? 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17459,Cartman,"Christ, he's like 50 years old! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17461,Cartman,"Dude, that's not cool. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17464,Cartman,"Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. [Skyler enters and pulls Cartman's underwear over Cartman's head. Shelly grins and Skyler drops him.] Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit! "

3,7,Cat Orgy,17490,Cartman,[rises] I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick! [thinks for a moment] Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over. 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17492,Cartman,"God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. [goes to the sink, opens the doors, and starts looking] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17494,Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. [pulls out a box of Playful Pussy Catnip and pours some onto the floor in front of Kitty] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17509,Cartman,"[with Polaroid camera in hand and a fresh picture] Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17511,Cartman,"Aaaaa! [runs away, and she gives chase. He runs up the stairs, but she catches up and grabs him by the foot halfway up the stairs. He kicks her off, then hurries to his room, closing the door on her as she reaches him] Yes! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17513,Cartman,I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17517,Cartman,You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17519,Cartman,"[sees his toy frog on the bed and walks over] What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? [dons his cowboy hat] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17521,Cartman,"Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog. [doffs his hat and sees Kitty on his dresser rubbing her ass on the wall. He walks over] Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar. [the banging subsides] You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me. [walks to the window and sets Kitty on the sill] Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope! [Kitty jumps from the window to the garage roof, then from the roof to the trashcan, then to the ground] That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! [Kitty ends up at the front door] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17523,Cartman,Oh! God dammit! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17531,Cartman,Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17533,Cartman,[wary] You just want me to open the door! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17535,Cartman,What?? Ih- is she okay? 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17537,Cartman,Huh?! [quickly opens the door] 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17539,Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17541,Cartman,"Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17543,Cartman,"O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, dammit! [he turns away defeated, and she gives him another wedgie over the head] AAAAH! [she pulls him downstairs by his underpants and enters the living room. Cartman groans at every step he hits] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17546,Cartman,"Aw, man, you guys suck. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17548,Cartman,You're the crappiest band I have ever heard! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17557,Cartman,"[rocks back and forth on his hook, hands to ears] Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17559,Cartman,"Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh! [Shelly walks to the coatrack] You get out now and respect my authoritah! [she pulls Cartman down a bit so the coatrack can act like a slingshot. She lets go and Cartman hits the ceiling] Ow! [lands on his feet as Shelly turns to walk away. She stops to watch the band and he picks her pocket to get his mom's note.] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17583,Cartman,Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17585,Cartman,"Well, there's a whole crappy band here! [""TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!""] Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? [directs the receiver towards the music] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17587,Cartman,"[""TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin'...""] Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17590,Cartman,I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here! [looks at his Mr. Microphone-type radio] My Speak and Record bear. Of course. 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17605,Cartman,"[softly] Testing, testing, 1 2. [stops and rewinds, then plays the tape. The recording worked] Sweet. [Shelly enters and Cartman hides his radio] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17607,Cartman,Okay. See you in a while. 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17609,Cartman,"Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17611,Cartman,"Well, I just, I kind of like having you around. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17613,Cartman,"No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. [Shelly's face softens] I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17615,Cartman,"Yuh, you mean it? "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17617,Cartman,"Hooray! [Shelly exits, Cartman speaks softly] Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17619,Cartman,"[recording] Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17621,Cartman,"That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17623,Cartman,"I'm just thinking out loud. [walks over to the bench and sits with his back to Skyler] Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh? "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17625,Cartman,"I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler? [Skyler simply bumps him off the bench] Agh! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17642,Cartman,Gotcha! [Skyler drives away in the red van] 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17644,Cartman," Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh wicky wicky Wild West! Shelly, guess who's busted! [Shelly continues crying] Hey! I said, guess who's busted! [Shelly doesn't seem to realize he's there] Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!   "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17646,Cartman,"Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway? "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17648,Cartman,You're not ugly. 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17650,Cartman,"Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls? "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17652,Cartman,"Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17654,Cartman,"If you want, I could help you. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17656,Cartman,Just let me get my cowboy hat. 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17663,Cartman,"[dressed as James West, reaches the open door] Okay, it's clear. [Stands watch as Shelly makes her way inside] "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17667,Cartman,We don't have much time! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17671,Cartman,Hurry up in there! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17686,Cartman,That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17688,Cartman,Oh my God! [the orgy is well under way] 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17690,Cartman,"You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty! "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17692,Cartman,"[gets the catnip and holds it up high] Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. [points the way out, then goes towards the door. The cats follow] That's it. Come on, come on. [opens the door, only to find Skyler waiting for him] Uh oh. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17695,Cartman,Yeah. I think we get along okay. 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17697,Cartman,Heh. [all are afraid. Two cats hide behind Kitty] Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat! 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17701,Cartman,"Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush. "
3,7,Cat Orgy,17703,Cartman,That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. [raps once more] 
3,7,Cat Orgy,17704,Cartman," [Shelly watches him perform and grins, then joins him in the dance] Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's Age, wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang [End credits roll] Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save Salma Hayek from the big metal spider Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh Cowboy from the Westside.

3,11,Chinpokomon,18829,Cartman,"[affecting an anime look] No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18831,Cartman,[exults] Hooray! [hops off the sofa and begins to walk away...] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18833,Cartman,Yes. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18837,Cartman,Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18841,Cartman,"[turns off TV and rushes to the kitchen, tossing the chicken tenders away] Mom! Mom! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18843,Cartman,"[pants] Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18845,Cartman,Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18847,Cartman,"[breathless] Mom-Mom! I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18849,Cartman,"[stops] ...But Mom, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18851,Cartman,"[shriek] ...But Mom, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18853,Cartman,Sweet. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18855,Cartman,"Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. [Liane opens the door, and both are shocked to find the store full of kids looking around and walking with Chinpokomon dolls. The class is there...] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18860,Cartman,"Oh, god damnit! [walks in and runs into Stan] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18862,Cartman,"Hey, dickhole. I guess you saw the commercial, too. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18864,Cartman,"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the cutest. [walks to the Pengin canister and finds it empty] God damnit, there's no more Pengins! [Kenny walks over with one] Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. [starts pulling] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18866,Cartman,C'mon. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18868,Cartman,"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha-- "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18870,Cartman,C'mon. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18872,Cartman,C'mon. Give me Pengin! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18874,Cartman,C'mon! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18884,Cartman,"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18886,Cartman,"God damn it, you're supposed to trade, you little asshole! Give me Pengin! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18890,Cartman,[haltingly] You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18892,Cartman,"Oh, please! Cyborg Bill is so yesterday. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18896,Cartman,"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18898,Cartman,It's all Chinpokomon now. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18901,Cartman,You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18905,Cartman,"[exasperated] Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18907,Cartman,Duhhh! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18909,Cartman,Duhhh! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18938,Cartman,"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18942,Cartman,"[haltingly] Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! [Cartman presses ""START"" on game controller] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18956,Cartman,Cool! This game rules! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18990,Cartman,I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...

3,11,Chinpokomon,19019,Cartman,I haven't made any money yet. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19021,Cartman,Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19024,Cartman,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19027,Cartman,[sighs] The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19032,Cartman,"Oh, my God, that's so yesterday! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19035,Cartman,"Like, eight days ago. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19050,Cartman,Get outta the way! Move it! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19062,Cartman,Ohhh. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19068,Cartman,Is this cool or not? I can't tell. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19080,Cartman,"Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. [""Ooo, Mr. Garrison is such an asshole!""] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19085,Cartman,"Minna-san! Kite kite, churi... [farts. The class laughs] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19131,Cartman,...Gay.

3,11,Chinpokomon,19211,Cartman,"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19216,Cartman,"Where are you going, Stan? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19218,Cartman,"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. [follows] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19230,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, that's way over. [a rat is on Kenny, trying to nibble] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19239,Cartman,"[sees rats on Kenny and swats them off] Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19241,Cartman,"Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19244,Cartman,"Me, too. [Kenny starts to tremble] I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- [Kenny falls and trembles harder. The others watch] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19246,Cartman,"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! [Stan and Kyle laugh as Cartman looks on, the credits play the instrumental theme that played in the Wild Wacky Action Bike & Alabama Man commercials] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19250,Cartman,"[suddenly excited] A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19252,Cartman,"[drops and sighs heavily] Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19254,Cartman,"[after a while] What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"" "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19257,Cartman," [finally responds, keeping the beat] C, H. ""Ch."" Chalk.   "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19259,Cartman," T, H. ""Th."" There.   Hey, this is easy! [raps] I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19266,Cartman,"You're going down, bitch! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19268,Cartman,"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! [signals something with a thumbs-up. The monkey and drums are next to him, on the floor.] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19271,Cartman,Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19277,Cartman,What?! What the fuck that that mean? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19283,Cartman,[as the bell rings] Holy crap! [the crowd is stunned] 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19286,Cartman,"Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum! [it looks around] Come on! [it begins to drum something else, getting excited. Cartman looks resigned] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19288,Cartman,Uuh. Definition?

3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19292,Cartman,Could you please use it in a sentence? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19294,Cartman,"Uh- chair. C H A R E [the buzzer sounds and Eric panics] God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! [races off the stage] Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19318,Cartman,Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. [the finalists come off the stage and stand in front of it.] 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19323,Cartman,"[mocking] Oh, yes. We must do it again. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19326,Cartman,How come you don't go to school? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19330,Cartman,You what? Stay at home? All day? No school? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19332,Cartman," [waxes poetic]Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?   "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19334,Cartman,"You shut up, [backhand slap] butthole. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19336,Cartman,"You shut up, [backhand slap] ass-logger! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19375,Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19377,Cartman,Ey! How come you never pick me?! 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19380,Cartman,"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19384,Cartman,That does it! [gets off his seat and moves towards the door] I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on! 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19386,Cartman,"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! [leaves and closes the door] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19464,Cartman,[sighing drowsily] Eeehhh. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19466,Cartman,"Eehh, shut up. [stretches] Ooohhh, yeasss. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19468,Cartman,"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19470,Cartman,Mom? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19472,Cartman,Could you turn up the heat just a little? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19474,Cartman,"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. [turns to his right side] Yeeehhhhhhss! [goes to sleep.] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19502,Cartman,"Ahhhhhhhhh. [""Jesus and Pals"" is heard in the background] Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19504,Cartman,"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. [sighs] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19506,Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. [she looks over and sees the Fonics Monkey tossing a box of Snacky S'mores around. She withdraws and Cartman yawns again. Stan and Kenny enter] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19508,Cartman,"[sleepily] Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19510,Cartman,"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. [moves to sleep again] Maybe tomorrow. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19513,Cartman,[sleepily] That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19515,Cartman,"No, Fonics Monkey! [the monkey throws Kenny up against the ceiling and stomps on him] No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! [the monkey smashes Kenny against the foot of Cartman's bed several times, then stomps on him until he no longer responds] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19517,Cartman,"You're damn straight, he did. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19606,Cartman,Now you're gettin' it. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19637,Cartman,Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19643,Cartman,"Oh, dude, this is not cool! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19645,Cartman,"No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19647,Cartman,"Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19649,Cartman,[pointing] Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! [Kenny looks at him] 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19653,Cartman,"Whoa, cool. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19655,Cartman,Totally! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19657,Cartman,"Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19661,Cartman,Oh. We don't know him. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19663,Cartman,"[""Kyle's makin' mudpies you guys want one? [the agents walk away and talk with each other. The boys laugh for a long time...] ""]"
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19690,Cartman,[gasping] K-kill me. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19693,Cartman,"No wait. I'll tell you. [the agents take off their ear muffs] He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19696,Cartman,Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19701,Cartman,"Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19720,Cartman,"Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? [a shot of Pat Robertson asking for pledges on the CBC channel.] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19722,Cartman,"Oh, my God, this guy again. [""What we do is- ""] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19727,Cartman,"Oh! Aww! [Part of the second story of the house falls away.] Oh, weak! [Marvin hops down from the ship] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19731,Cartman,"Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19743,Cartman,"Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? [""And it's a wonderful day 'cause something-""] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19758,Cartman,"No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19760,Cartman,"Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? [presses a big red button on the left side of the display panel. The ship bucks and heads into space.] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19778,Cartman,Ey! I'm the leader of Earth! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19780,Cartman,"Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! [the Marklar leader looks a bit confused. Marvin steps forward and smiles. The land around the group is green and lush, water is plentiful...] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19798,Cartman,"No, never. It's perfect. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19831,Cartman,"Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19835,Cartman,Forget him! He's done for! [Stan climbs up and looks back] 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19838,Cartman,"No, no, he's done for. Come on! [the windshield rolls down and the ship takes off. It zooms into the distance, then straight up into space. The helicopters could not catch up] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19855,Cartman,U-u-huh. I don't remember. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19858,Cartman,"Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. [presses the big red button] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19879,Cartman,Holy shit! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19896,Cartman,It's Sally Struthers! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19899,Cartman,Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19901,Cartman,"Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. [Sally looks moved] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19905,Cartman,"Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. [Sally considers Cartman's statements for a moment, then...] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19908,Cartman,She bought it. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19914,Cartman,"Wait. I remember. It was the red button! [presses it, and the ship zooms away. The wormhole appears again and the ship head for it] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19940,Cartman,"Alright, "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19951,Cartman,"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19953,Cartman,What? We're not gonna come visit him. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19955,Cartman,"T'heh, whatever. [the Ethiopians chatter over their new home and head for the lake at the foot of the waterfall] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19959,Cartman,"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! [answers himself] Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19961,Cartman,I'm playing the drum. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19963,Cartman,"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! [to the drum, hitting it once in a while] Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fucking drum!! [to Kyle] That's how you rock, dude. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19965,Cartman,"[""I am keepin' the beat your flute-playing sucks! ""]"
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19967,Cartman,"Ey, I'll get it! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19969,Cartman,Yes I will! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19971,Cartman,"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damn it! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19973,Cartman,What? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19975,Cartman,No way! Flutes are totally gay! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19978,Cartman,"Oh! Well, you know what I say?! [drops his drum and jumps on it] Screw you guys, I'm going home! [walks away, leaving the drum split in two] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19980,Cartman,Later. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19994,Cartman,"[arrives dressed in the Grey] Good morning, gentlemen. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19997,Cartman,"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19999,Cartman,"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20002,Cartman,"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20004,Cartman,Yes we are! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20008,Cartman,"Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20010,Cartman,Right. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20012,Cartman,"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. [walks away] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20032,Cartman,Yippie! Long live the Confederacy! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20038,Cartman,[skating by on the bell] Hooray for the South! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20043,Cartman,But why? Why should they get the bell? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20045,Cartman,But we don't have to lose. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20047,Cartman,"[assuming command] Gentlemen, we can win this battle! [paces] Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" [some of the men drink schnapps] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20066,Cartman,God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20081,Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and Kyle] So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20085,Cartman,[sighs] I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. [the men are getting more drunk] 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20091,Cartman,[walks up to Jimbo] Perhaps we should take Topeka. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20093,Cartman,"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20095,Cartman,No. I say we take Topeka. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20101,Cartman,[throwing his voice] I'll bet you can't. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20103,Cartman,"[fake voice] I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20113,Cartman,"[trailing, stops by his friends] Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20115,Cartman,"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20136,Cartman,[walks by] Excuse meh. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20144,Cartman,"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20184,Cartman,"Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle [her brows rise in surprise] on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20190,Cartman,"[with pipe in mouth] Where did the Confederates go, son? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20192,Cartman,"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go. "

3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20212,Cartman,[at his tent entrance] Where are you going? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20214,Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! [Randy stops by] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20216,Cartman,[watching the sober Confederates walk away] No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!

3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20229,Cartman,"Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20240,Cartman,"[intervenes] Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20247,Cartman,Yes! Yes! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20253,Cartman,Take the fort! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20260,Cartman,Suck my ass! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20262,Cartman,We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20268,Cartman,I knew they would! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20272,Cartman,Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20279,Cartman,"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20295,Cartman,"I don't. I made it up. [Kyle and Stan approach Clinton as Lincoln and Davis, respectively] "

3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20319,Cartman,"Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20321,Cartman,Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20323,Cartman,The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20326,Cartman,Hahahaha haa ha!

[Formal Cartman before a starry sky] It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie. [Present-day Cartman finishes decorating the tree, helps himself to a pie] Jesus was born, and so I get presents.

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20698,Cartman,"I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! [grins] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20701,Cartman,Yes! I really did. 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20703,Cartman,"Well, because yesterday I got my period. [lets the words hang there for a moment] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20705,Cartman,"My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20711,Cartman,"Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture. [begins to dance away backwards] I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. [skips out of view] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20763,Cartman,"Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people. [drops the Breeze and picks up the Plug-Ups. Softly] Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm. [swaps the Plug-Ups for the Cotton Cork] Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh. [swaps the Cotton Cork for the Beaver Dam] Oh, this one's got wings, you guys! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20765,Cartman,[pleased] You did? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20768,Cartman,"Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve. [Stan shrugs, but looks worried] But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20795,Cartman,"Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20797,Cartman,Tampon? What's a tampon? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20799,Cartman,"Ew, doesn't that hurt? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20802,Cartman,"Wow, cool! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20805,Cartman,"All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20807,Cartman,"Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve! [Stan is left alone, but Cartman returns] Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. [walks away] "

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20831,Cartman,Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?! 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20833,Cartman,"And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20836,Cartman,"Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20838,Cartman,"What's the matter, Kyle? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20840,Cartman,"...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20898,Cartman,"Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. [tips the bowl towards Kyle, who reaches in and takes a slip of paper] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20901,Cartman,"Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20906,Cartman,"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20908,Cartman,"Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20910,Cartman,"Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she- "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20912,Cartman,"Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has- "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20914,Cartman,"Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20940,Cartman,"[walks in with Kyle] Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. [Jesus takes the stage and speaks] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20944,Cartman,"Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20947,Cartman,"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. [he and Kyle walk off] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21007,Cartman,"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21009,Cartman,"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. [Kenny laughs so hard he falls off his seat] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21030,Cartman,That was pretty cool. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21033,Cartman,"[with recorder] Okay, how about this one, Kenny? [plays an A note] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21035,Cartman,No? How about this? [plays a G note] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21037,Cartman,"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? [plays a Gb note. Kyle and Stan turn around on their seat] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21039,Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21041,Cartman,That's a scientific term for crapping your pants. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21043,Cartman,Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21045,Cartman,"How about this one, Kenny? [plays an F note] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21048,Cartman,That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21082,Cartman,"[aside, to Stan, softly] Stan, what's a queef? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21086,Cartman,"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21088,Cartman,Aaaa- 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21099,Cartman,"[reading another book, jumps for joy] Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21102,Cartman,"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise."" "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21105,Cartman,"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21138,Cartman,"How about geebo, or, or mung? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21184,Cartman,"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21226,Cartman,"[rushing into the room with Kenny wearing earmuffs] You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21229,Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. [places some earmuffs on Stan's head] There, okay. Let's see here. [places some earmuffs on Kyle and rushes back to his side of the room] Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21233,Cartman,"[removes his earmuffs] Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. [leads them outside where a UPS delivery man is offloading packages, and the three put on their earmuffs. He whispers] Okay. [plays that bass note again] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21236,Cartman,I told you guys! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21238,Cartman,That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21240,Cartman,Ooooh. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21242,Cartman,"They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21294,Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. [shows it to them on his book] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21296,Cartman,"Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21324,Cartman,Uh-oh. [Kenny finally shows up] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21354,Cartman,"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21362,Cartman,"Mom! MOOOM! Mom! [races down the stairs in pajamas, cap, and coat in the right hand and two dollars in the left one, and stops at Liane's feet] Seriously! Something wonderful has happened! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21364,Cartman,"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! [shows them off] She's only given me a lousy quarter before! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21366,Cartman,[hops onto the sofa] Yeah! This is so tits! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21368,Cartman,"Oh, I mean, this is so cool! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21370,Cartman,"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! [dons his coat] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21372,Cartman,"Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! [turns and walks out] Aw, man, this is so tits! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21374,Cartman,"[off camera, heard running up] Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at Cartman] Oh my God, you guys, seriously! [runs around them] Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! [turns to face them] Aren't you stoked?! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21377,Cartman,"[pants, then] Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! [presents the two dollars] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21381,Cartman,For one tooth. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21384,Cartman,"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21386,Cartman,"Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21388,Cartman,All we need is teeth. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21394,Cartman,"[moves to Kenny's side] Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21396,Cartman,"[ignoring the answer] Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21406,Cartman,"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. [tugs on Kenny's hood] ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21424,Cartman,How are we gonna get it from him? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21431,Cartman,"Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21434,Cartman,"Higher, you guys. "

4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21438,Cartman,"[in falsetto] I am the tooth fairy, my child. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21440,Cartman,"Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. [reaches under and grabs Butters' tooth, then beholds the treasure. He then places some money under the pillow as Butters sneaks a peek.] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21442,Cartman,Ey! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21444,Cartman,['Do not open your eyes until morning. [Butters has them shut real tight Cartman tugs on the rope and is pulled out of the room] Or else I will kick you in the nuts. [drops down] Square in the nuts. ']

4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21450,Cartman,"I love that song, Mom. Sing it again. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21452,Cartman,Okay.

4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21458,Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! [runs around them counterclockwise] Holy crap, you guys! I mean- "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21460,Cartman,Four dollars. [the other three answer at the same time] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21464,Cartman,Do you what this means? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21479,Cartman,Tih- [the tooth he placed under his pillow is still there] Tooth? [picks it up and looks at it in disbelief] What the hell? Mom! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21481,Cartman,"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21483,Cartman,"[laughs] You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... [mother and son sit silently for a while] M- Mom? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21485,Cartman,Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21487,Cartman,"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21489,Cartman,"How can I trust you? [hops off the bed] How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. [tugs at his pajama shirt] Myself and Willikins Bear, of course. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21491,Cartman,"[covers his ears] No, Mother! No more lies! [runs out of his room and shuts the door] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21494,Cartman,[flatly] There is no money. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21497,Cartman,I know! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21499,Cartman,"[stops, then faces them sadly] You guys... [turns away] Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21501,Cartman,"[faces them again] You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. [turns away again] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21503,Cartman,"My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21506,Cartman,"But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. [Kenny approaches him and reaches out, but Cartman bushes him off] Don't touch me, Kenny. [Kenny steps back] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21508,Cartman,"Kyle, open your eyes, man! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21526,Cartman,"Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21528,Cartman,"No, man, that's just a TV show. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21530,Cartman,"What? That your parents lied to you, too? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21532,Cartman,How? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21538,Cartman,"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21541,Cartman,Yeah. [leaves with Stan and Kenny] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21546,Cartman,"Wow, look at the size of these houses! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21548,Cartman,"Hey, [points across the street] that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. [the boys head for a rambling ranch house. They skip the front door and head for the back] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21550,Cartman,Got it. [Stan and the others lift Cartman up.] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21552,Cartman,What the-? [the camera peels back to show another group of kids on the other side of the bush] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21558,Cartman,Yeah! You ripped off our idea! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21562,Cartman,It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21578,Cartman,We were there first! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21592,Cartman,"Man, that is tits! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21598,Cartman,"Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see... "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21602,Cartman,"Two percent, have my penis cut off. [Kyle gets mad at him] Two percent- "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21624,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. [tosses Chef a wad of bills] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21626,Cartman,"That's right. Keep the change, my man. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21653,Cartman,"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21655,Cartman,"Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21657,Cartman,"Sure, Kyle. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21666,Cartman,"So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21668,Cartman,[takes a scope out and analyzes a tooth] How much? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21670,Cartman,"Can I ask you a question, Weasel? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21672,Cartman,[rests his scope] Do you think I'm an idiot? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21674,Cartman,"These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! [Weasel starts acting like a monkey. Kyle is seen reading another book] Get out of my sight! [Weasel hops off the chair and splits] Lousy little scum! [the phone rings] What?! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21676,Cartman,I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! [hangs up] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21703,Cartman,"Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! [leaves the tub] This is gonna be tits! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21705,Cartman,[returns] Will somebody take those books away from him? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21713,Cartman,"Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21725,Cartman,"[thinking aloud] Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21732,Cartman,[retrieves the cash] I got it! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21741,Cartman,Kyle? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21750,Cartman,"Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face. "

4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21776,Cartman,We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21791,Cartman,"Tolkien, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time [walks to a rock and picks it up] I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! [Kyle draws near to Tolkien] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21793,Cartman,There! [chucks the rock and it knocks Tolkien down] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21795,Cartman,[sees what he's done] Heh. Huh. Uh-oh. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21799,Cartman,"[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Mom. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21801,Cartman,"[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Tolkien. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21803,Cartman,"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? [drops from his chair] The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. [turns and heads for the door] See ya later. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21805,Cartman,No way! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21813,Cartman,...What the hell is a hate crime? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21816,Cartman,What? A federal offense? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21818,Cartman,Oh no?? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21826,Cartman,"Uh, yes? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21828,Cartman,He's a black kid that goes to my school? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21830,Cartman,He is black. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21832,Cartman,I did? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21834,Cartman,No! I hate hippies! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21836,Cartman,"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21839,Cartman,"[off camera] Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21846,Cartman,No! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21853,Cartman,"[jumping excitedly] Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21855,Cartman,They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21857,Cartman,"[slaps Kenny] Calm down, Kenny! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21859,Cartman,Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21861,Cartman,"Well, come on! I don't have much time! [heads for the garage. Outside, the garage door opens and a tiny truck creaks out with Kenny at the wheel and Cartman in the back seat] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21866,Cartman,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21888,Cartman,Huh-who's Romper Stomper? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21910,Cartman,Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.

4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21914,Cartman,"[softly] Oh, thank you, Jesus. [normally] So we're friends now? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21917,Cartman,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21959,Cartman,Hey you guys. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21961,Cartman,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think? "

4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21969,Cartman,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21972,Cartman,"[a guard walks past him] Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21974,Cartman,Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21976,Cartman,"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, [hushed] then I need those cigarettes. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21978,Cartman,Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21980,Cartman,"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. [Stan and Kyle look at him and bust out laughing] Shut up, you guys! It's not funny! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21982,Cartman,"Well, okay... here... l'see... "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21985,Cartman,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. [leaves the visiting area] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21987,Cartman,"[at the door] Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. [the guard opens the door and Cartman walks in] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21994,Cartman,Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21996,Cartman,"Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. [groans some more until a plop is heard] There's one.

[flushes the toilet and Romper looks up horrified] Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! [walks back to Romper crestfallen] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21998,Cartman,"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22000,Cartman,Son of a bitch! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22028,Cartman,"[moans and tries until a small splash is heard] Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. [walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground] Here you go, God-damnit! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22030,Cartman,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22032,Cartman,But you said- 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22034,Cartman,I thought that- 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22036,Cartman,I want my Mo-omm [cries some more and rubs his eyes] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22038,Cartman,"Mommy, I want my Mommy! [continues crying] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22040,Cartman,You will? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22061,Cartman,[turns around] What's the matter? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22063,Cartman,Uhokay. [turns and runs] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22065,Cartman,Oh. Really?

4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22069,Cartman,Okay. [retrieves them] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22071,Cartman,Oh. I can't take these. [offers them back]

4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22075,Cartman,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22077,Cartman,"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22079,Cartman,"[takes it] O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. [walks away] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22095,Cartman,[Butters looks up] You guys! [runs over a hill into view and races towards the group] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22098,Cartman,"That's right! I'm back! [Clyde walks over and hugs him, and he is surprised] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22100,Cartman,What the hell's wrong with Clyde? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22104,Cartman,I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22106,Cartman,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22108,Cartman,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's- "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22115,Cartman,Hey. [pulls out the pails and tosses them at the girls' sled] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22126,Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22128,Cartman,Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22130,Cartman,Sweet. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22134,Cartman,"Hey, Romper Stomper. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22136,Cartman,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22138,Cartman,You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22140,Cartman,"[begins grunting. A few moments later, and a grin breaks out on Stomper's face. A big splash follows] Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22142,Cartman,Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. [splash. Romper is stunned] Ogh! Wait-

4,3,Timmy 2000,22151,Cartman,"[praying softly at his desk] Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22153,Cartman,Phew! 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22156,Cartman,"[praying] Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you- "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22158,Cartman,"Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus! "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22220,Cartman,"Yeah, me too. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22228,Cartman,[sleepily] Hoo-ray. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22259,Cartman,That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22292,Cartman,That was awesuhome! 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22314,Cartman,"[arrives with Kenny and speaks mellowly] Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin? "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22316,Cartman,"No, dude, you gotta try it. [hands a bottle to Kyle] It makes you feel good. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22329,Cartman,"It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. [shakes two pills out of his bottle and swallows them] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22340,Cartman,Did you guys see that? 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22356,Cartman,"[Clyde is a bit shocked] What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison? "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22359,Cartman,"There you go. [smiles, then frowns] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22361,Cartman,Whah! 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22408,Cartman,"I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22411,Cartman,"So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. [a Christina Aguilera bug is crawling all over Kenny] Hooray. [looks] Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. [takes his pan and swings it at Kenny. It strikes, and Kenny's face is smashed in. Kenny falls forward, hits the floor, and a puddle of blood forms under him] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22439,Cartman,"Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! [runs around] She's on my back! Hah! [leaves] "

4,3,Timmy 2000,22480,Cartman,"Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh[the monster still munches on him as he rolls on the ground] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22532,Cartman,"He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! [Liane smacks him on the back of the head] Ow. [the clown tries once more with Stan. Stan rolls his eyes, takes the umbrella, and is showered by it when the clown presses the horn. The crowd roars with laughter as the clown revels in his cleverness] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22534,Cartman,"[comments] Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts from bursting out of my sides! [the clown gets mad as Cartman talks, then takes the umbrella from Stan and walks away in a huff] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22536,Cartman,"[echoes the announcer] Sarque du Son Bleu. [sticks his tongue out. A performer comes out and starts singing] Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22544,Cartman,"Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? [the quints pile on to make an X, then roll off and reposition themselves into a circle] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22553,Cartman,"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22555,Cartman,"Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! [they pass ""LE SOUVENIRS,"" a booth manned by a clown dressed in yellow.] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22558,Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22585,Cartman,"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22648,Cartman,What's going on? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22655,Cartman,No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22668,Cartman,"But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22695,Cartman,"[in a low voice] You guys, come here. [steps forward. The others join him] This is totally awesome. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22698,Cartman,"Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22705,Cartman,Hooray! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22747,Cartman,Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down. 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22749,Cartman,"Damn, we might be screwed. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22752,Cartman,"[in a log ride with the other seven, passes a lumberjack scene] You see, in America we have… log rides! [Kenny and his mom are at a bus terminal in Denver.

Next day] Sheep-shearing contests! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22756,Cartman,[showing the others around a three-story shopping mall] And shopping malls! Hooray! [the girls are grinning. Kenny finally lands in Europe and goes out through gate 96]

4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22912,Cartman,"[Front of board game box is seen with 'Kurtis' spelled incorrectly with a 'C'] It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22914,Cartman,"Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. [presses an electronic Bill Kurtis head] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22918,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! [tosses the card in front of him] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22920,Cartman,I just gave you AIDS. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22923,Cartman,"Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns [Kyle turns angry] and 800 points. [camera pans back, and Kenny's parents appear at the door with arms around each other] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22927,Cartman,"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22929,Cartman,"...You see. [stands] Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22931,Cartman,"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here [hovers his right hand at eye level], and all my friends are down here [hovers it at stomach level]. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22933,Cartman,"Nononono! Me h'myah [hand at eye level], you guys myah! [hand at chest level] — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. [hand at foot level. Then he straightens up] SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. [turns around, walks out, and towards the front door.] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22936,Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. [looks at Clyde Frog for a few seconds, then] Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! [walks over to the chair and hops on] I can meet new friends on the Internet! [clicks the mouse and presses a few keys, then the computer chimes. A list of chat rooms comes up] Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys"" [moves the cursor to the title and clicks on it] That's perfect. [starts typing] Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- [replies start cascading over his message] Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. [click on Tony's reply and starts typing] Hi Tony. [clicks and reads the reply] ""So what are you into?"" [replies] Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. [clicks and reads the reply] ""Kewl. Wanna get together? [softer] Smiley-face?"" [replies] Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.

4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22942,Cartman,"[takes the bag] Wow, cool! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22944,Cartman,"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends [Tony places his hand on Cartman's back and starts rubbing with an open smile]; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22946,Cartman,"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. [two agents burst through the main door and head for Tony and Cartman] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22949,Cartman,Huh? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22952,Cartman,[concerned] What the hell just happened? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22977,Cartman,"Okay, we'll try this again. [starts typing as BigBoned] Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- [More quickly than before, his screen fills with cascading replies. He picks one] Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. [starts typing] Hello, HungDaddy. [reads the reply] ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. [Says out loud:] Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. [Types and says:] Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. [clicks and moves on] Lemme see, how about this one? "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22979,Cartman,[draws close to the man] Mister Hammerhead? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22981,Cartman,Mr. Garrison?? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22983,Cartman,You wanna be my friend? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22985,Cartman,"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first? "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22991,Cartman,"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22999,Cartman,"[walks up] Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23001,Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! [Stan and Kyle are confused and look at each other] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23003,Cartman,"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23005,Cartman,"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23007,Cartman,YES I AM!! [Stan and Kyle back up a bit. Cartman turns and walks away] 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23031,Cartman,"Dr. Mephesto, I need help. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23033,Cartman,"[follows Mephesto and Kevin in] You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23035,Cartman,Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23037,Cartman,NAMBLA? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23039,Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! [turns and walks out] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23048,Cartman,Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23050,Cartman,Sure. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23052,Cartman,[looks around] ...Sweet. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23062,Cartman,[rushes up from the other direction] Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23064,Cartman,"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! [turns and walks away] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23089,Cartman,"Thanks, dude. [poses in his beefcake swim pants for several shots before a curtain that says ""I LOVE NAMBLA""] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23091,Cartman,Really? Awesome![continues to pose in various ways as camera shutter sounds are heard] 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23093,Cartman,"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, [looks back at the camera and mumbles] excluding Stan and Kyle, of course. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23095,Cartman,KIIICK ASS! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23114,Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23116,Cartman,"We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23118,Cartman,"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23120,Cartman,You can't go. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23122,Cartman,"No, you CAN'T go. [turns around and walks away] Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23142,Cartman,"[sees them] What the hell? [hops off his chair and walks towards them] Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23144,Cartman,"Hunh. [rolls his eyes] Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23148,Cartman,"[graciously, amid some applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [takes a bow] Thank you. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23227,Cartman,They're all over the place. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23232,Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23234,Cartman,"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. [the other boys are shocked at the thought] And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. [presents him] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23236,Cartman,"Now, are you a team player or not?! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23238,Cartman,"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team."" "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23240,Cartman,"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23242,Cartman,"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23260,Cartman,"Well, what? "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23263,Cartman,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23265,Cartman,"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. [the paramedics finish putting Stuart into the ambulance and head for the cab] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23279,Cartman,"[in a low voice] Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23286,Cartman,"[raises his hand] Here. [he, Stan, and Kenny laugh heartily. A few seconds later his nose bleeds a white liquid all over his desk] Oh, hoho. Ow. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23288,Cartman,"Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23290,Cartman,Huh? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23292,Cartman,"Not with me, man. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23297,Cartman,[drawn out] He's fakin'! [the other kids get busy decorating the card] 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23299,Cartman,But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23402,Cartman,"""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew [grabs for the yellow ship] Give me the space cruiser, Kenny. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23404,Cartman,"Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser [pulls the cruiser his way] so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23406,Cartman,"No, mine. M'yah! [the ship breaks in two, with Kenny getting the short end] Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha [his nose spurts out white fluid again] bluh oh, ha-ow! [blocks his nostrils] "

4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23410,Cartman,"Okay, mom. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23412,Cartman,"What's goin' on, guys? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23414,Cartman,Oh-kay. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23416,Cartman,Uh huh. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23418,Cartman,"Oh, I think I see where this is going. [Kyle moans] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23420,Cartman,"Stan, why don't you just ask the question? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23422,Cartman," [sings and dances] No no, no no, no! No no, no no, no!   "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23424,Cartman," 'No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!   "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23427,Cartman,"Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23430,Cartman,"I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23432,Cartman,"Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23435,Cartman,"What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23437,Cartman,"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. [they return to the floor to continue play] ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23511,Cartman,No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies! 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23522,Cartman,"[smacks her] Shut up, Fluffy! [she quiets down and Cartman goes back to sleep, closing his door.] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23525,Cartman,"Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! [Stan rises from the other side of the bed with the medical book, and Butters rises, too] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23529,Cartman,"[rises quickly] whatwhatwhatwhat? [sees Stan and Butters] Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23531,Cartman,"[faces them] Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23533,Cartman,I do! I do care! Look how much. [a blank expression is on his face] Look. Look how much I care. [the expressionless face persists] 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23592,Cartman,"Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! [jumps back. His Kidney Blocker 2000 lies at the foot of his bed over streaks of blood] That son of a bitch! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23594,Cartman,"[fuming] Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23596,Cartman,"It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23598,Cartman,"Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23602,Cartman,"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! [sits] Please. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23604,Cartman,"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23606,Cartman,Thank you. [signs the release form] 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23615,Cartman,"[wakes up] Heh. Hey, what what's going on? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23617,Cartman,Huh? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23621,Cartman,Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF! 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23626,Cartman,[livid] I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!! 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23629,Cartman,"Oh good, you got the crappy kidney. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23650,Cartman,Thaaat's ri-ight. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23653,Cartman,Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23655,Cartman,"Yes, I do! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23657,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! [rises from his seat, heads for the door, and exits] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23728,Cartman,"[enters] It's okay, I'm here. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23730,Cartman,"[begins pacing] Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23732,Cartman,"That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility! [starts barking orders] Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23734,Cartman,"The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23736,Cartman,[takes out some Cheesy Poofs] Mmmm. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23738,Cartman,"You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again? "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23740,Cartman,"Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on? "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23742,Cartman,"Whoa! Calm down, ho. [eats some poofs] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23780,Cartman,"I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! [as Bog Monster] O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23782,Cartman,[as Captain Candycone] Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! [as Bog Monster] Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! [as Captain Candycone] I'll kick you in the nuts! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23784,Cartman,You won't let me help. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23786,Cartman,"[thinks a moment…] …Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it. [Wendy remains mad at him. He does Bog Monster] Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih. [she averts her gaze, then breaks into a smile] Wendih. Seriouslih. [she chuckles] The Bog Monster speaketh. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23829,Cartman,[aloof] Uh huh. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23831,Cartman,Why don't we just talk about the swastika? 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23833,Cartman,"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23835,Cartman,Yeah. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23837,Cartman,Cool. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23839,Cartman,"Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs."" "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23841,Cartman,No way! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23843,Cartman,Me neither. [Romantic music starts to play] 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23845,Cartman,Huh. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23847,Cartman,Whoa. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23849,Cartman,"[withdraws his hand] Ur, s-sorry. [shoves the plate to her a bit] Go ahead. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23875,Cartman,"Ahh! [they run into each other's arms and tumble down, laughing all the while. At the bottom, Wendy's on her back and Cartman is on top of her] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23877,Cartman,"Okay, It will be like this forever. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23969,Cartman,"Me, too! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23971,Cartman,"[fronting] Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23973,Cartman,"Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, [finger points at her] huhuh, he, haha. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23978,Cartman," [steps forward for a solo bridge as the others sway back and forth] And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy You're my girl, you're my girl   "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23980,Cartman," [continues] My... girrrrrrrl... [lifts up his shirt to show off the right breast—um, pec. The others turn to their right while maintaining their gaze and pointing their gun fingers at the audience. The music builds as women scream at the sight]   "

Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don't you? That's it! [rushes out of bed] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23985,Cartman,"[pacing back and forth] Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. [stops and faces them] God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23987,Cartman,Boy band. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23989,Cartman,Boy band. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23991,Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23993,Cartman,"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! [pulls out a tape from his back pocket] I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23995,Cartman,"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. [intense] So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it-- "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23997,Cartman,So?

4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24019,Cartman,"[through the mic] We'll let you know, Butters. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24021,Cartman,"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24024,Cartman,"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better do it better than that. [into the mic] Next! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24026,Cartman,Kyle's brother?

She walks to the piano player, gives it to him--] Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryout's for a boy band! [a grinning Wendy suddenly frowns and her head hangs.] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24039,Cartman,[moves the mic away] No way! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24041,Cartman,"Okayokay, fine. Wow me. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24043,Cartman,"Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. [Wendy is angered] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24045,Cartman,"Dude, she's a chick! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24047,Cartman,"""Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! [Wendy looks down at her chest] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24051,Cartman,"Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24054,Cartman,Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24056,Cartman,"We have to rehearse all that we can! [moves away] Now, check this out: [returns with a box of clothes and sets it on the floor] My mom made us costumes! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24058,Cartman,"Yeah. [starts handing out the costumes] This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... [she looks a little embarrassed] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24060,Cartman,"'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24062,Cartman,"[looks back blankly] ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not-- "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24064,Cartman,You can't be the tough one because you're Jewish! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24066,Cartman,Since when?! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24068,Cartman,"Alright, fine! Here! [tosses the tough costume at Kyle, knocking him down] Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! [moves away. The band dresses. Kenny is a baseball player, Stan is a fighter pilot, Cartman is an Elvis impersonator, Kyle is a tough dude with nose ring and Fu Manchu mustache] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24070,Cartman,"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... [waves his finger around] pretend to use your finger like a gun or something. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24073,Cartman,"[testy] Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24075,Cartman,"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24078,Cartman,"[leading the band members through the mall] Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24080,Cartman,We're goin' to see the mall manager. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24084,Cartman,"[pleading] But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, [the veteran guard pulls out a small bottle of pepper spray and shakes it up] so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the-- [the veteran guard sprays his face all over] Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..! [squeezes his eyes shut and rubs them] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24086,Cartman,"Oh, God, I can't see! [rubs his eyes] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24089,Cartman,[coughs a few times] The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! [all join him down the mall] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24099,Cartman,[over the PA system] Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. [crowds rush off to get their Nissans] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24101,Cartman,"Alright, guys, here we go. [enters the office with the others] Hello, sir! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24103,Cartman,We... are Fingerbang! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24105,Cartman,We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24107,Cartman,"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24109,Cartman,"Alright! Let's do it, boys! [moves aside and sets the boom box down, then sets the tape to play. He returns to the group, and they begin. All of them are all off-key, They all sing too ahead of the music and Wendy's voice is squeaky and lags behind the others...] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24111,Cartman," [goes into his solo, and back into his dream] And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl You're good, You're gonna be--   "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24113,Cartman," --you're my fantasy, you fanta--   "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24115,Cartman,"[backs up into the band] Well, so can we play here? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24117,Cartman,No?? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24119,Cartman,Why not?! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24121,Cartman,"You don't think we're any good, do you?! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24123,Cartman,"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. [goes to get his boom box] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24143,Cartman,"[eyes downcast] Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24145,Cartman,I just don't know what I'm gonna do. [lets himself in] Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. [goes to the sofa and pulls out some Cheesy Poofs to eat] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24147,Cartman,"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, [with feeling] I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? [the woman sits on Chef's left side and strokes his arm] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24149,Cartman,What's the Gomlich effect? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24151,Cartman,So how do boy bands use that? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24153,Cartman,Thanks! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24155,Cartman,"Okay. [Chef watches as Cartman drops down and heads for the front door, exits...] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24157,Cartman,[outside] Cucumber in the pants. Got it. [and closes the door] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24159,Cartman,"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24161,Cartman,"I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. [Timmy sits in the cameraman's chair] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24164,Cartman,"Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. [the band walks across the ground in front of the girls] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24166,Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24168,Cartman,"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24171,Cartman,Fine! Who would you go crazy for? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24173,Cartman,"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24175,Cartman,Roll camera! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24178,Cartman,Jesus Christ! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24181,Cartman,"Aaand cut! [music stops] Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24183,Cartman,"Oh uh, Kyle has it. [the girls move to Kyle. Cartman walks away] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24202,Cartman,"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. [crowds of mall shoppers head for the orange smoothie machine] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24204,Cartman,[enters the manager's office] Hello again! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24206,Cartman,I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24208,Cartman,"[retrieves a TV cart with VCR and pops the VCR in. The video pops up] If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! [at first, only the boys' hats are seen, near the play elephants. The camera spins right, then down, and the girls' feet are seen. The camera spins up and left, and finally rests on Timmy] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24210,Cartman,"Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. [the camera gets a glimpse of the four girls, then moves off them a second after Cartman appears] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24212,Cartman,Son of a bitch! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24214,Cartman,[dead air on tape] You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24216,Cartman,Really? You will? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24218,Cartman,That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24220,Cartman,"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! [a previous recording is shown:] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24224,Cartman,"Aw, Mom! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24285,Cartman,Where the hell is Stan?! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24287,Cartman,"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24289,Cartman,"Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24291,Cartman,Yeah. We'll start right away. [the manager walks away. Cartman turns to Kyle] We'll have to do it without him. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24294,Cartman,"Oh, god-dammit! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24311,Cartman,God dammit! People are walking away! [drops back behind the curtain] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24313,Cartman,Just another minute. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24315,Cartman,"[stops and looks up] Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24318,Cartman,"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! [walks off smiling as Stan arrives] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24320,Cartman,"[approaches the manager] Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24322,Cartman,"We will! [moves to the front of the stage and addresses the audience] Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."" [the manager takes offense] And so, without further ado, all five members of the... "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24326,Cartman,[traumatized] No! He can't be dead! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24328,Cartman,No! We were so close! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24330,Cartman,But we have to perform! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24334,Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24336,Cartman,"Chuh! [only four shoppers remain to clap for them] Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24342,Cartman,"Ok-Okay, okay. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24346,Cartman,"Okay, yeah, maybe. [the mall cops walk away] God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24348,Cartman,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"" "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24354,Cartman,"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. [the stage is empty now, but Cartman returns and looks up] You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. [turns and walks off again] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24360,Cartman,"[as Mackey speaks] Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation. [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" [stops] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24363,Cartman,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] to increase the population of the younger generation."" "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24365,Cartman,"No no, no. Separation. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24368,Cartman,[falls off the pew and onto the floor] Ugh! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24408,Cartman,"Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. [runs out after the other two.] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24431,Cartman,"A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24433,Cartman,"Yeah, what if we haven't? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24435,Cartman,Jesus was made of crackers? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24441,Cartman,So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24452,Cartman,"[unconvinced, closes his Bible] Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! [rests his head on his left hand] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24454,Cartman,[startled] Nno! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24456,Cartman,"But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24485,Cartman,"Oh yeah, okay. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24487,Cartman,"Right, I already got that one. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24493,Cartman,"Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24495,Cartman,"No, you're already going to hell. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24497,Cartman,"You are, too! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24501,Cartman,Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24507,Cartman,What'd we do to Timmy? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24510,Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24530,Cartman,[approaches] How was it? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24532,Cartman,Huh? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24534,Cartman,Who's in there? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24536,Cartman,"Well, here goes everything. [walks to the penitent side of the confession box and enters.] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24538,Cartman,"[hesitantly] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24540,Cartman,"Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass... "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24555,Cartman,"And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24557,Cartman,"Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24559,Cartman,"No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. [Cartman looks up for a response, but nothing happens] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24561,Cartman,"Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. [the priest grows more concerned and his jaw drops] And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog. [Priest Maxi's worry has turned to anger he's trying to contain] And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of- [an arm tears through the partition and grabs Cartman by the throat] -eh- Ow! [throttles him back and forth] D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow! [the priest pulls him up into the partition a few times] Eh! Oh! Help. [The confession box rocks back and forth] Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24564,Cartman,[the door opens and he falls to the floor] Uh-huh- [Stan and Kenny rush up] Oho! Ohoho. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24566,Cartman,"I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God. [Stan and Kenny get afraid] He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24625,Cartman,[points the hose at Kyle] Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24627,Cartman,Turn around so I can clean out your ass. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24629,Cartman,What? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24631,Cartman,"Oh, now you've said it, too! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24634,Cartman,"Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24636,Cartman,"Ugh. Oh, I know. [runs away, but returns with an attachment] We can use Wacky Water Weasel! [sets everything up, and the Weasel sets to work spraying Timmy, Kyle, and Ike.] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24679,Cartman,And he never took Communion! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24682,Cartman,Yeah. [the kids make their way slowly across the street] 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24702,Cartman,"Come on, hurry up! [Stan reaches the door] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24704,Cartman,[moves in and tries to open it] What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24707,Cartman,"I'm first, I'm first! [trips Tolkien and runs past Stan. Tolkien quickly gets up and walks with the others. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24709,Cartman,"[closes the door] What the? [opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins. The kids look back in horror, and his face changes] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24714,Cartman,You're doing unnatural things in the house of God! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24716,Cartman,"Oh, this guy is so gonna burn! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24719,Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24724,Cartman,"We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh! [Chef and Mr. Garrison arrive] If thy hand offend thee, cut it off! [Stan's parents and the nun are there] It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed- "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24726,Cartman, 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24728,Cartman, 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24730,Cartman,There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24732,Cartman,"It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there! "
4,10,Probably,24761,Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves! "
4,10,Probably,24769,Cartman,"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! [a group of adults gathers just outside the rear school doors. Kyle joins Cartman on the platform...] "
4,10,Probably,24778,Cartman,"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was [throws himself down face-first] smacked down by the Lord-uh! [rises] God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! [kids gasp, adults go glum] But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, [Kyle has left and now returns with an easel with a picture of a church on it] so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya [near the top of the left-side wall] to this part hmya. [the grass down below] Who will help us? "
4,10,Probably,24780,Cartman,Praise God-uh! 
4,10,Probably,24818,Cartman,This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed. 
4,10,Probably,24824,Cartman,"Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. [the boys turn left and walk towards Cartman's house] "
4,10,Probably,24829,Cartman,"No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress! "
4,10,Probably,24831,Cartman,"This is a distraction from our work on the church! [grabs a doughnut] Do not think that you can tempt us with toys [takes a bite out of his doughnut] and new games [munches away] and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! [finishes the doughnut off] Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!! "
4,10,Probably,24838,Cartman,"Let us get back to our work at the church. [the phone rings] Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. [answers it] Hello? "
4,10,Probably,24840,Cartman,"[grins mischievously, then] Oh my God!! "
4,10,Probably,24842,Cartman,It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave! 
4,10,Probably,24845,Cartman,Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail! 
4,10,Probably,24873,Cartman,"[on stage wielding a Bible] Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. [the kids gasp] It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. [the kids are frightened] He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish. "
4,10,Probably,24875,Cartman,"He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh! "
4,10,Probably,24877,Cartman,"And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh! "
4,10,Probably,24882,Cartman,"[quite animated, hops twice] We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! [points] "
4,10,Probably,24884,Cartman,"Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?! "
4,10,Probably,24887,Cartman,"The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh! "
4,10,Probably,24889,Cartman,"Let us pray. [an organ is played] Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry. "
4,10,Probably,24918,Cartman,"Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. [Sister Anne approaches] "
4,10,Probably,24920,Cartman,"Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. [Liane leaves] "
4,10,Probably,24922,Cartman,"Sister, have you read this book? "
4,10,Probably,24924,Cartman,Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh. 
4,10,Probably,24926,Cartman,Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true? 
4,10,Probably,24928,Cartman,"We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! [resumes his work] "
4,10,Probably,24931,Cartman,Well... 
4,10,Probably,24956,Cartman,"Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh? "
4,10,Probably,24958,Cartman,Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?! 
4,10,Probably,24960,Cartman,"That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! [smacks him on the face] Theah! "
4,10,Probably,24962,Cartman,Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya? 
4,10,Probably,24964,Cartman,Praise the Lord-uh! 
4,10,Probably,24966,Cartman,"For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! [Timmy rolls up in his wheelchair] This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk! "
4,10,Probably,24969,Cartman,We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh! 
4,10,Probably,24971,Cartman,Devil be [smacks him on the face] gone-uh! 
4,10,Probably,24973,Cartman,"Now walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed] "
4,10,Probably,24975,Cartman,"[turns away, then back] Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh! "
4,10,Probably,24977,Cartman,"The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed] "
4,10,Probably,24979,Cartman,He walks-uh! 
4,10,Probably,24982,Cartman,Yes! Praise the Lord! 
4,10,Probably,24995,Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? [this boy wears glasses] "
4,10,Probably,24997,Cartman,And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it? 
4,10,Probably,25000,Cartman,"Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! [smacks the boy in the face and knocks him out] "
4,10,Probably,25003,Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?! "
4,10,Probably,25005,Cartman,He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at! [smacks her on the face] Bah! 
4,10,Probably,25007,Cartman,"[moonwalks] Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!"" "
4,10,Probably,25034,Cartman,"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! [The clapping stops as confused faces appear in the congregation, and the music quiets a bit. Stan and Kyle look at each other as Cartman goes for the collection box] So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, [sets the box at center stage] and putting a dollar in the box-ah! [kids begin to approach the stage] Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! [rolls on his back as the donations come in] "
4,10,Probably,25061,Cartman,"[offscreen] Yeess. [the camera looks at him, now rolling around shirtless in $1 bills, now grabbing a bunch and bathing in them] Yeess. [sees Stan and Kyle] It worked, you guys, it actually worked! "
4,10,Probably,25063,Cartman,Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all! 
4,10,Probably,25066,Cartman,"Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! [grins big] Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route. "
4,10,Probably,25068,Cartman,"It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school. "
4,10,Probably,25070,Cartman,"Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that. "
4,10,Probably,25072,Cartman,"My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow! "
4,10,Probably,25074,Cartman,[rolls around in the money] Suck my balls! 
4,10,Probably,25091,Cartman,Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! [Sister Anne enters the church] 
4,10,Probably,25093,Cartman,Sister Anne is a blasphemer! 
4,10,Probably,25097,Cartman,[worried] Uh-oh. 
4,10,Probably,25099,Cartman,"[tugs on Jesus' robs, then softly] Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay. "
4,10,Probably,25101,Cartman,"[goes for the collection box again] Ee-yes, by doing that, [brings it out] and, putting a dollar in the box-uh! "
4,10,Probably,25106,Cartman,"[on his knees] No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! [the last congregant leaves the church] Wait! No! No! [pounds the floor with his fists a few times] I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit! "
4,10,Probably,25110,Cartman,You're gonna send me to hell? 
4,10,Probably,25114,Cartman,"[sees Kenny] Aw, crap! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25150,Cartman,"Yeah, [punches Pete down] get out of here! [withdraws] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25152,Cartman,"There, that's better. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25155,Cartman,"U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. [Kevin arrives] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25161,Cartman,"[softly] Why, that's PERfect! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25175,Cartman,"[takes a seat] Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks? "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25184,Cartman,"[chuckles, leaps up on his desk, and moons Ms. Choksondik] KISS MY ASS!!! [no one else moves a muscle, as they are still awed by the teacher's appearance. Cartman looks left, then right...] Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25186,Cartman,"[with his back still to Ms. Choksondik] Oh, I'm sure I do. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25188,Cartman,I'm trying. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25190,Cartman,"[pulls his pants up and sits down again] Fantastic, then. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25195,Cartman,You guys are all such pussies! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25199,Cartman,Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25201,Cartman," Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was. [wistfully] Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade? We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade [a classroom scene, then a playground scene as heads of Cartman and Kenny float by] We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice [Mr. Garrison is dressed as a pirate before a happy class] Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles [Their desks turn into marshmallow seats and float up as the classroom fades into sky. A teddy-bear face floats by] The world seemed to all make sense but that sense seems to slowly fade [They float towards a rainbow and sun, and the scene fades to black, then to the playground] After Third Grade In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons [Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land] We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue [Cartman makes a glitter picture of a cow's face] We had warm cookies and hearts full of love [Kenny makes one of a clown holding a bloody knife in one hand and a boy's bloody head in the other] And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you... [Cartman sings to the audience and points] There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute [Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land, then gives each kid a happy spanking in a room full of huge wrapped presents. The scene fades to the playground again] To Third Grade [A moment of silence, and Clyde starts to cry. Butters draws near and consoles him]   "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25204,Cartman,[wistfully] I wish I was still there. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25211,Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25213,Cartman,"Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25216,Cartman,"Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25256,Cartman,"[hops up on his seat] Suck my balls!!! [no one else moves] Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously- "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25258,Cartman,"We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makes-me-sick! We didn't feel like it! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25260,Cartman,"Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? [a handheld controller with two thumb joysticks is activated. The two nerds get to work] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25265,Cartman,"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! [the wheelchair is launched and Timmy moves towards the chalkboard] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25270,Cartman,You're damn right they do! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25389,Cartman,"Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him? "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25416,Cartman,Who the hell cares?! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25422,Cartman,"God, these guys are such geek dumbasses! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25460,Cartman,"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25462,Cartman,"Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck [the contraption is shown and the duck quacks.] Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? [the nerds activate their controllers] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25470,Cartman,"There it is! Come on, everybody! [the kids move towards the portal] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25472,Cartman,"No way, lady! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25474,Cartman,You can suck my balls! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25476,Cartman,...What? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25479,Cartman,"Touché, teacher. Touché. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25485,Cartman,What?? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25512,Cartman,"[walks up with his own folder] Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. [slight pause. Kyle reacts angrily] Yeah, well, [opens his up] it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, [opens it up again] flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25515,Cartman,"Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25517,Cartman,"[""He's not a genius he's a little douchebag. ""]"
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25520,Cartman,"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. [soft music plays and Cartman starts to dance] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25531,Cartman,"Yeah, that's me. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25533,Cartman,"Yeahhh, you already know about it? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25535,Cartman,"Well... [mocking] ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"" "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25539,Cartman,"[stick the notebook out] Here, Kyle. [Bill stares at Cartman's Trapper Keeper] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25553,Cartman,And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. [Kyle glares at him with arms crossed.] I can take something as simple as this calculator [a Wellington Bear model] and... Trapper Keeper? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25555,Cartman,Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25557,Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25560,Cartman,"Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. [wiggles them outstretched] If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25562,Cartman,"Oh really? [hands the folder over to Kyle] Then, why don't you hold it? [Kyle looks at it in Cartman's outstretched hand.] Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. [inches closer and whispers] Hold it. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25564,Cartman,[inches closer and whispers] Hold it. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25581,Cartman,"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25583,Cartman,"Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25585,Cartman,"Okay, that's cool. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25587,Cartman,"A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- [by this time, ""Bill"" has pulled away from the pole and Cartman, and has the tether taut and ready to release] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25589,Cartman,"Ugh..! [""Bill"" goes after the Trapper Keeper and runs away with it] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25591,Cartman,Ey! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25594,Cartman,"You son of a bitch! [recalls something] Wait a minute. [whips out a small gadget and activates it] Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. [walks towards the source of the sound heard in the device and away from his friends] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25616,Cartman,Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25618,Cartman,"[grabs Barbrady's ] It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- [spots ""Bill""] There he is! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25620,Cartman,Got ya! [grabs the steering wheel from Barbrady] 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25626,Cartman,"Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25628,Cartman,"[takes his place] Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25640,Cartman,[long pause] You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25642,Cartman,"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25644,Cartman,"Aw, damnit! [throws his Trapper Keeper to the ground] Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! [walks off to his left sadly] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25670,Cartman,"[walks up with another Trapper Keeper] Hey, dudes. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25672,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! [holds it up high] So everything worked out. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25675,Cartman,Why the hell not?! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25677,Cartman,Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25679,Cartman,[holds his Trapper Keeper close] But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25681,Cartman,"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. [moves off to his left] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25683,Cartman,Ech! Screw you guys. Home. [walks away] 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25716,Cartman,"Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away.[singing his own Dawson's Creek theme song] I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap-- "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25718,Cartman,"Oh, cool. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25720,Cartman,[softly] Whoa... 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25734,Cartman,"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get-- "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25736,Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr-- "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25738,Cartman,Huh? [walks towards his computer] 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25741,Cartman,"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? [cables come from the monitor and grab him] Ugh--! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25783,Cartman,"[à la HAL 9000] What are you doing, Kyle? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25785,Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25787,Cartman,"Hey, screw you. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25789,Cartman,"Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25842,Cartman,"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25844,Cartman,"Awww, man... "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25846,Cartman,"Alright, alright. [sighs] Kyle... "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25857,Cartman,"[in the second front row, directing] Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25860,Cartman,"No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25865,Cartman,"God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25869,Cartman,How good? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25875,Cartman,"Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25877,Cartman,"Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25882,Cartman,"That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25884,Cartman,This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25906,Cartman,"Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25912,Cartman,"Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey! [Timmy's turkey sidles in with its head on the ground. Kyle and Timmy follow] What the hell is that? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25915,Cartman,And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25918,Cartman,"[looks at Kyle for a long time] Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second? [they walk off to one side of the stage and stop, out of earshot] Kyle? Why do you do these things to me? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25920,Cartman,"You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"" "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25927,Cartman,Cool! Can you get it for us? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25933,Cartman,"No no! [tosse another sheet over his shoulder, to join other wads on the floor. His mother enters the room] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25935,Cartman,"I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25937,Cartman,"[whining a bit] But [turns around] Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25939,Cartman,"[spins around and gets back to work] Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?! [looks at a small portrait of Helen Keller on his desk, picks it up and studies it] Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice. [after looking at the portrait some more, he gets frustrated and slams the portrait onto the desk] Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25943,Cartman,[in the audience] OP-pression! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25950,Cartman,Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25952,Cartman,Yeh. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25954,Cartman,Whoa. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25958,Cartman,"Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody! [the kids move back...] Where the hell is Timmy? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25961,Cartman,"Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. [Timmy takes his lighter and sets his hoop on fire, then lowers it for his bird] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25966,Cartman,"No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25968,Cartman,"No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25970,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! [Alinicia protests vigorously, shedding feathers everywhere] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25972,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25975,Cartman,"[walks up] Dude, we need your turkey for our play! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25977,Cartman,"I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25979,Cartman,I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25981,Cartman,"Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show? [laughs, but realizes he's alone in this] Oh. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25983,Cartman,"Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. [walks off] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25991,Cartman,"Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second. [whisks himself onstage] Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2 [starts moving Gobbles along] stand just a little bit more over... [puts it behind the Comedy Central logo] here. [mulls over the position] Let's see, maybe a little more up in here. [moves it a bit towards stage center] And just a wee bit over here. [Gobbles is back behind the logo, a bit] And right about... [moves Gobbles a bit back] hm'ere. [steps back] There we go. Good. [goes off stage. A cable whips out of place somewhere. A lighting fixture falls on Kenny and kills him] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25994,Cartman,"Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26002,Cartman,"[Jeffrey continues his dirge] Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work! [looks at Lamond] All of us! [Lamond crosses his arms] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26020,Cartman,"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see. [writes] no [writes] No. [writes] NO! [writes] God-damnit [takes the sheet and squeezes it into a wad] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26022,Cartman,Terrible! [turns and faces Jeffrey] I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26024,Cartman,Like what? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26026,Cartman,"Hey, that's not a bad idea. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26029,Cartman,"Oh, man! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26031,Cartman,"No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26033,Cartman,Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire! [starts writing furiously] Yes! Yes! I have it now! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26061,Cartman,"[cheerfully] Alright everybody, let's take our places! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26063,Cartman,"I don't know. [Stan and Kyle cross their arms] I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26091,Cartman,"[rushes up] Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26094,Cartman,Union Mafia bastards! [Timmy looks at Lamond in fear] 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26100,Cartman,Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26102,Cartman,"...Alright, fine! Get in costume! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26110,Cartman,What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26132,Cartman,"[walks up with Kyle] Okay, we're ready for the- [stops in his tracks and stares at the dead Alinicia.] What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26135,Cartman,[exults] They loved it! They LOVED it! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26145,Cartman,That's it? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26460,Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26463,Cartman,Whoa! That totally surprised me! [his mom looks at him] I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26465,Cartman,"[sweetly] Mom, can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? [grins] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26467,Cartman,"God, I have to do everything around here! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26470,Cartman,"I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.] What the hell's going on? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26473,Cartman,[incredulous] What?! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26475,Cartman,You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26478,Cartman,Fat camp? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26480,Cartman,"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, [grabs his creation and drops the plate on the floor] but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26483,Cartman,"[pleading] Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26509,Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off, Rick! How are you? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26512,Cartman,[darkly] Don't touch me! [moves away a bit] 
4,15,Fat Camp,26516,Cartman,No. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26530,Cartman,[miffed] Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26554,Cartman,[resumes jogging] This... is... bullcrap! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26557,Cartman,[in withdrawal] I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26560,Cartman,[shoves his plate to the boy] Take it! I can't eat this crap! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26562,Cartman,"[to the girl] Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26564,Cartman,"Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26566,Cartman,"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. [sees the entrance and races for it. He exits and races through the meadow until he reaches a road.] We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? [an ice cream truck approaches him] An ice cream truck! Hey wait! [races up to the truck. The driver exits the cab] Boy, am I glad to see you! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26568,Cartman,"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26570,Cartman,"Hunh? [is lifted up] Uuh! [and tossed into the truck. The doors are closed behind him, and he looks up. Before him sit four other kids who have tried to escape] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26572,Cartman,"[stands up] Aw, God-damnit! [turns] LET ME OUT OF HMYA! [pounds on the back doors] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26600,Cartman,Memememeee! [the group heads for the kitchen while Stan and Kyle stay behind] 
4,15,Fat Camp,26655,Cartman,Is anyone starting to suspect anything? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26657,Cartman,"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26659,Cartman,What?! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26661,Cartman,Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26663,Cartman,"[soft gasp] Suck my balls, 20! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26665,Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! [the new Cartman looks trapped] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26695,Cartman,"[turns around] Alright, they're gone! [walks to his bed and pulls out a suitcase from underneath] The Cartman store is open! [the other kids leave their bunks and head for Cartman] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26697,Cartman,"[quickly as he hands the goods over] Two donuts and a pack of licorice. [she walks away,and a big, tall boy is next] Well, Tony, the usual? [Tony, with squinty eyes, blinks and Cartman gives him the usual. Tony walks away. Another boy walks up, crying] Why are you crying, Chad? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26699,Cartman,"[comforts Chad] Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26701,Cartman,"Yes. [dangles a chocolate in front of him] A chocolate friend. [Chad begins to howl] Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. [opens the wrapper to expose the aroma and tempts him] Look at how yummy and sweet he is. [Chad, still sobbing, takes the candy bar and starts eating. Cartman bides his time] ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. [Chad hands him the money and finishes the candy bar. Cartman just watches] ...There you go. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26786,Cartman,"[off to one side] ...65, 66, 67... [counting the dollars he's collected during his stay] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26788,Cartman,"[through gritted teeth] Eh- shut up, you half-Chad! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26797,Cartman,"You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! [grins hopefully] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26800,Cartman,What?! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26802,Cartman,"Well, screw you, fatasses! [begins sobbing, and pulls out a donut from his pocket. He eats at it between sobs.] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26817,Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26832,Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26835,Cartman,"Well, I guess you're screwed, then. [walks away with the other two] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26868,Cartman,"[smoothly] Well, you... could make them... go away for a while. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26870,Cartman,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26872,Cartman,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26874,Cartman,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26879,Cartman,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, [slight whine] ""my parents molestered me."" "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26881,Cartman,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this: [starts a fake sob, rubs his eyes] ""My parents molestered me."" [stops the fake cry] And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say [rolls his eyes as he thinks] ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait, [points] you say it was a bad touch. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26883,Cartman,"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch."" "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26885,Cartman,"Yeah, And cry. [Kyle lets out a soft cry] Oh, he's ready. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26898,Cartman,"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26902,Cartman,"[slides up in front of the others] You guys! Come out here! [walks out the door. The other two follow, leaving Ike alone on the sofa.] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26905,Cartman,Notice anything? [before them the town sits empty as the sun sits between two mountains in a red sky.] Watch. [takes a stone and throws it hard. It flies through the air and goes through a first-floor window on a building two blocks away] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26907,Cartman,"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. [more kids gather] They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26983,Cartman,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? [Mark and Linda look at each other] Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26985,Cartman,"Parents? [his left-hand assistant (Francis) whispers in his ear and withdraws] Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26987,Cartman,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26989,Cartman,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26991,Cartman,"[opens up an empty jar and speaks into it] Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. [closes the lid on the jar as Francis waits on him and hands the jar to Francis. He hops down and goes out the door] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26994,Cartman,"[tosses the jar aside, and it breaks] So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. [moves a plate of treats forward] Ringy-ding? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26997,Cartman,"Aaahh! [jumps from his chair a second before a huge spitball crashes through the window and lands on the floor. He picks himself off the floor and goes to look out the window angrily] You sons of bitches! [turns to the couple] You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. [Mark and Linda, both unsure, look at each other] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27071,Cartman,Where is your husband? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27073,Cartman,Seize her! [the others move forth] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27079,Cartman,[outside] Outlander! [all look in the direction of the sound] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27081,Cartman,"Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27083,Cartman,"Butters, calm down, alright? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27095,Cartman,"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! [gives her a small shock] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27097,Cartman,"Heh, heheh. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27101,Cartman,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27103,Cartman,The Provider awakes! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27105,Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Alright. [gets formal] It is decided. [points, in normal voice] Butters, your turn. [other kids back away. Tweek and another boy take Butters away.] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27109,Cartman,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27121,Cartman,Take him down. [Tweek and the other three unchain Butters] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27161,Cartman,Snow igloos kick ass. [Mark and Linda stare as if the events of the last ten days didn't leave an impression on the boys] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27182,Cartman,"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. [turns aside and walks off] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27184,Cartman,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27187,Cartman,Heh-tchoo! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27189,Cartman,"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27196,Cartman,Family? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27213,Cartman,My moms barely bought me any presents so far. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27216,Cartman,Anything for more presents! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27222,Cartman,"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- [a couple walks past] God-damnit! [a man walks past in the other direction] Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! [a woman walks by] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27239,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27243,Cartman,"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27245,Cartman,My mom could make a better Christmas special than this! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27251,Cartman,"Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27285,Cartman,"[points] Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27287,Cartman,What?! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27289,Cartman,"I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! [Butters sets the poster on the desk, face up] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27326,Cartman,"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27333,Cartman,...deh..OOOWW!!! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27342,Cartman,"[grins] Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27344,Cartman,"[throws his headphones off] Don't call me fat, buttfucker. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27394,Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27396,Cartman,"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! [walks off and stops at the door] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27439,Cartman,"[enters victoriously] Thank you, thank you. [Stan and Kyle look at him annoyed] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27441,Cartman,"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27472,Cartman,I guess- we might as well- go home now. [the boys leave and Mr. Hankey wilts] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27503,Cartman,"Yeah, ham. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27506,Cartman,Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27529,Cartman,Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27532,Cartman,Yeah! I'll be a Jew too. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27542,Cartman,"[off-screen, but rushes in] You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27544,Cartman,"I was just- [looks stung, then flashes an angry look at Kyle] I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27546,Cartman,"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27548,Cartman,"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27550,Cartman,You'll never guess. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27552,Cartman,Guess. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27554,Cartman,"You ready? [focus on Cartman] Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, [looks both ways] ""Shit."" "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27558,Cartman,"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27561,Cartman,Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27563,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27568,Cartman,"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27594,Cartman,"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27613,Cartman,I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27638,Cartman,"Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27640,Cartman,"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27642,Cartman,"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27653,Cartman,[quizzically] Huh? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27655,Cartman,I don't get it. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27662,Cartman,"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27664,Cartman,"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27699,Cartman,"Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of ""shit"". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. [licks his Popsicle] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27701,Cartman,"You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. [Kyle rushes in with Kenny behind him] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27705,Cartman,"[dismissive] Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27708,Cartman,"Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27734,Cartman,"[points to Kyle] Detective Sandy Vagina here [Kyle looks angrily at Cartman] thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27752,Cartman,"You guys, look here. [the others move over to see] In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27754,Cartman,"So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. [laughs] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27757,Cartman,"Oh-Ho, gross! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27761,Cartman,Kenny's got it. heh heh. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27766,Cartman,"[brushes himself off] Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27791,Cartman,"But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27882,Cartman,I knew it! Meecrob! [the word is shown in close-up] Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27885,Cartman,"My house, too? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27906,Cartman,"[as the Geldon sets more fires] Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! [one knight's horse's tail is on fire.] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27909,Cartman,What a stupid voice. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27921,Cartman,"[camera cuts to him] So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. [murmurs and a smattering of applause come from the audience.] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27934,Cartman,"Hah, I love you guys. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27942,Cartman,That's not funny! Jesus Christ! 
5,2,Cripple Fight,27945,Cartman,"Yeah, he's excited. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27948,Cartman,"[flatly] Hey, Butters. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27992,Cartman,"Hey, yeah! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28005,Cartman,"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28008,Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28019,Cartman,"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28026,Cartman,"Hehe, I don't sound like that. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28085,Cartman,"Cripple fight! [the other boys cheer, but Mr. Grazier bursts through the doors] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28087,Cartman,Awww! 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28093,Cartman,"[to Kenny] Man, this guy sucks. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28110,Cartman,Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again! 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28113,Cartman,But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader. 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28142,Cartman,"[moves over to her] Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! [takes her box and looks inside, then tosses it away. She goes after the box] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28157,Cartman,Cripple fight! 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28162,Cartman,"Cripple fight! [after a moment, the congregants get up and leave] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28164,Cartman,"[on speakers] Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! [the shoppers abandon their carts and exit] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28225,Cartman,"Eh, we kick ass. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28259,Cartman,[walking up] Who's this asshole? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28261,Cartman,"Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream? "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28283,Cartman,"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28288,Cartman,When are we gonna learn magic tricks? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28299,Cartman,Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28301,Cartman,Cool. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28325,Cartman,"[thinking he's indistinguishable] Heheh, guess who I am, you guys? "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28364,Cartman,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28367,Cartman,"[giggles] Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28369,Cartman,Cool. [the woman shows the boys in] 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28372,Cartman,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you? "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28374,Cartman,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28376,Cartman,He's going to eat his own head. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28379,Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28381,Cartman,No you're not. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28383,Cartman,No you're not. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28385,Cartman,No you're not. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28387,Cartman,No you're not. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28392,Cartman,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28394,Cartman,"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. [turns right and walks down the street. Kyle looks back at Stan for a few seconds, then follows Cartman. Stan turns and walks down the street in the same direction Kyle and Cartman were walking, but stops when a car appears in front of him. He sees some adult Blaintologists inside. The driver starts the car and moves towards Stan, who turns about face and begins to run with his bike. The car looms behind him and he lets go of his bike.] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28425,Cartman,What's he doin' here? [Jesus goes on stage] 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28427,Cartman,"Now how the hell did he do that? [Blaine simply extends his right arm, lifts the bread and fish mentally from the cart and drops them over by Stan] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28463,Cartman,"[jubilant] Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28481,Cartman,"[sits up abruptly, knocking Kyle off the bed] No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? [now alert, if confused, and Kyle stands up] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28483,Cartman,[sighs silently] Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28485,Cartman,What? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28487,Cartman,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either. [points to his groin] I haven't even gotten my pubes yet. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28489,Cartman,"That co- ugh. [drops to a whisper] That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28492,Cartman,I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28494,Cartman,"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28496,Cartman,"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28498,Cartman,At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28527,Cartman,"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! [pushes the dome into the pool] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28529,Cartman,[brings the hose over] But it's the only way for us to be happy. [plugs the hose into the dome and releases the water] 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28563,Cartman,"[trying to drown himself from the edge of the Reflecting Pool] Bliegh! [rises. His body is on land] Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep [dunks his head in the water again]. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28589,Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to do it. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28604,Cartman,"Oh, that's so sweet you guys. [Stan and Kyle are not amused] You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh [Kyle turns and kicks Cartman in the groin, knocking him down] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28606,Cartman,"[Stan kicks him] Ah! [Kyle's turn] Ow, stop it! [Stan's turn] Ah! [they continue taking turns kicking Cartman in the groin — Roshambo!] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28610,Cartman," Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa, heydy heydy heydy, how's it goin', guys?   "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28612,Cartman,"[coolly] Oh, nothing. No big deal, really. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28614,Cartman,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28616,Cartman,"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28621,Cartman,Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28623,Cartman,You wanna see 'em? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28625,Cartman,"[reaches into his pants] Here, check 'em out. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28627,Cartman,"There, see? How do you like them apples! [in his right hand is a clump of pubic hair. The other boys look, with Kyle ready to cover his eyes again] HA! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28629,Cartman,My pubes. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28631,Cartman,I got 'em from Scott Tenorman. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28633,Cartman,Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks.  [sing-song] Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! [dances a little more] 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28635,Cartman,"[moves in between Stan and Kyle and embraces them, one under each arm, and gloats. Kyle looks at Cartman's right hand] Don't be jealous, guys. [Kyle looks at Cartman] This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. [Kyle looks back at Cartman's hand] It just means that I matured faster than you. [Kyle fears for that hair touching him] You'll get your pubes guys, someday. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28637,Cartman,Uh oo what? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28639,Cartman,Nuh uh! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28641,Cartman,[looks at his purchase] But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28643,Cartman,You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28645,Cartman,[walks off in a huff] Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28650,Cartman,"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28652,Cartman,"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28654,Cartman,Just give me back my money... 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28656,Cartman,"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28659,Cartman,"[in costume, with briefcase] Hello, sir, my name is Kris Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.  "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28661,Cartman,"[thinks a bit] Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you... "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28663,Cartman,"You will? Oh, cool! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28665,Cartman,"Oh. Uh, lessee. [pulls out some money] I only got six dollars and twelve cents. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28667,Cartman,...Okay. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28669,Cartman,Right. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28671,Cartman,Cool. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28673,Cartman,"Sweet! [the door closes] Uh. Oh, goddamnit! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28675,Cartman,"That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28677,Cartman,What? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28679,Cartman,"He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! [the boys reach the box office and buy their tickets] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28683,Cartman,"One please. [with no money, he tries to pay with pubic hair. Nothing happens for a while] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28685,Cartman,"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28687,Cartman,"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28689,Cartman,Racist! [takes the pubes and runs off] 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28691,Cartman,"Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28693,Cartman,[stunned] What? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28695,Cartman,[softly] Wha-? Uh oo [audibly] why do you want then back so much? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28697,Cartman,I don't believe you. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28699,Cartman,Pube fair? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28701,Cartman,Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28703,Cartman,"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28705,Cartman,"Haha, charade you are, Scott! [runs away quickly] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28708,Cartman,"[cuts through the line] Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! [enters the bus] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28710,Cartman,Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28712,Cartman,"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28714,Cartman,Can you tell me where the pube fair is? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28716,Cartman,"Yeah, I have some pubes to sell. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28718,Cartman,No- no such thing? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28720,Cartman,I'm Eric Cartman. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28722,Cartman,[screams] Aaah!!! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28724,Cartman,"A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28726,Cartman,"Alright, Scott, you win. I give up. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28728,Cartman,"Yeah, I'll see you around. [walks down the steps and towards the street, but stops] Sure is too bad about my grandma, though... "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28730,Cartman,"[turns around] Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28732,Cartman,Yeah. Poor grandma... 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28734,Cartman,"[evilly, to himself] Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. [turns around and returns to the house. Scott returns] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28736,Cartman,"Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! [Scott withholds the money] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28738,Cartman,What? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28740,Cartman,Huh? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28742,Cartman,Why?? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28744,Cartman,"[looks around to make sure no one else is watching, then quickly] Please Scott give me my money. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28746,Cartman,I beg you to give me back my money. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28748,Cartman,What? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28750,Cartman,[looks around] I'm a little piggy. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28752,Cartman,[points to his nose] Here's my snout. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28754,Cartman,Oink oink oink. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28756,Cartman," [looks back angrily for a few seconds, then] I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink. [Scott begins to laugh] I'm a little piggy; here's - Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!   "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28758,Cartman,What- What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!... Wh-why? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28760,Cartman,[yells at the sky] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28762,Cartman,"[descending the stairs] Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. [walks to the easel] I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! [Clyde raises his hand] Yes, Clyde! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28766,Cartman,"[correcting Kyle] Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28768,Cartman,"Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony [flips the first page over to reveal a drawing of a pony and takes up the pointer with his left hand], we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. [the other kids just stare back, but Cartman continues] It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28770,Cartman,What? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28772,Cartman,"Oh, right. Why should we care? [slaps the pointer into his right hand] Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"" [flips to the next page, which has written on it ""$16.12"" with double underline] Now who's with me? [turns around to find only Timmy in the basement] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28774,Cartman,"[slaps his forehead and sighs] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28777,Cartman,"There we go. [stands aside] Come and get it. [camera pulls back to reveal a pony nearby] ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. [the pony looks, then approaches] Come on, good pony. That's it! [the pony sniffs the wiener] Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! [the pony bares its teeth... only to start licking the wiener] Oh no, pony, he'll like that. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28779,Cartman,"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. [by this time, the pony is sucking on the wiener] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28781,Cartman,He said it was okay. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28783,Cartman,Because [ominously] of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28785,Cartman,"[noticing the sucking] Not like that, pony! [slaps the wiener out of its mouth] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28787,Cartman,Whattayou mean? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28789,Cartman,How do I do that? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28792,Cartman,I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28794,Cartman,"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28796,Cartman,"You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a weirdo... "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28799,Cartman,"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a [British accent] li'l ol' scheme [normal] that involves them. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28801,Cartman,Whoa! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28803,Cartman,I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28806,Cartman,"Radiohead. Yes, of course. [drops down] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28820,Cartman,"[cheerfully] Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28822,Cartman,"Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. [gloats] Everyone's gonna be there! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28824,Cartman,"You're welcome, Scott. [turns and walks away] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28826,Cartman,"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? [activates the screen and then walks off stage] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28828,Cartman,"[has taped over the band's answers with his own — first as Thom Yorke] That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. [now as Johnny Greenwood] Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. [Now as Ed O'Brien] I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28829,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? [Scott looks down, and ponders Cartman's role] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28831,Cartman,"[Now as Phil Selway] Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. [Now as Thom Yorke] Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28832,Cartman,"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. [Scott is gone] Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! [feedback is heard] What a retard! [the kids around him face right] And now everyone saw it! [looks around] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28834,Cartman,"[on screen] '""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""' [the kids begin to laugh hard, then harder. The same clip is shown over and over, and Kenny begins to laugh. Soon he can't control himself, and falls over dead. His ghost appears and continues laughing] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28836,Cartman,[seething with anger] That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28838,Cartman,"Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! [goes into whispers and brings out a protractor and a compass] Then... that... [finishes his plan] Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! [a truly evil grin appears on his face.] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28841,Cartman,"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28843,Cartman,How to get Scott Tenorman back! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28845,Cartman,"I just finished planning a brilliant [British accent] li'l scheme [normal] that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. [holds out two fingers] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28847,Cartman,"It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28849,Cartman,"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! [camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28851,Cartman,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! [laughs demonically] Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! [nothing happens for a few seconds] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28853,Cartman,"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! [walks over to the pony] Ready, pony? [the pony nods] Bite it! [the pony bites off a piece of the wiener] Yes!! [exults] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28873,Cartman,"[with tickets in hand] Hello, Scott! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28875,Cartman,"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. [shows him the face of the ticket] Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28877,Cartman,"[getting smug] Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28879,Cartman,"Oh, it will be very neat, Scott. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28881,Cartman,"[under his breath] A little penis-biting, perhaps? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28883,Cartman,"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28885,Cartman,"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. [Scott turns around and closes the door] Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. [leaves] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28906,Cartman,"[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them] Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28908,Cartman,"[smug] Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28910,Cartman,What's so funny? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28912,Cartman,"Not yet, but they will be. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28915,Cartman,"Hey, Chef. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28917,Cartman,What contest? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28919,Cartman,"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28921,Cartman,"[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly] Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! [Scott holds a small container of chili] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28923,Cartman,"[overjoyed] Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28925,Cartman,"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28927,Cartman,"[sighs silently] Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. [Scott leaves] Goddamnit! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28930,Cartman,"[inspecting the dish] Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. [hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28932,Cartman,"Alright. [takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments] Hey, this is great! [Stan and Kyle stifle giggles] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28934,Cartman,"[begins to wolf down the food] Gawh, this is really good, Scott! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28936,Cartman,"What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [Everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28938,Cartman,"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [A shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the ""starving"" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28941,Cartman,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behnd Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."" "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28943,Cartman,[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned] 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28957,Cartman,"[walks over to Scott's end of the table] Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! [starts licking Scott's tears off his face] Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28960,Cartman,"Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy. [licks the tears off the table and off Scott's face.] Mm-yummy you guys! [the iris common to Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons appears, with fanfare] Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! [waves] "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28963,Cartman,"Whoa, bummer, dude. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28970,Cartman,Are you sure? I haven't seen it. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28992,Cartman,[running in circles] You guys! Hey you guys! You guys! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28999,Cartman,Awesome! Give me mine! [Kyle gives them out] 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29016,Cartman,"Well yeah, dude. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29036,Cartman,Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29046,Cartman,I think this new guy's funny. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29071,Cartman,"Aw, dude, gay! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29074,Cartman,Racist! [a boy wearing glasses watches the foursome approach. The boys fall in] 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29077,Cartman,"Don't talk to us, kid. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29080,Cartman,Kenny's a random slut. [a look of anger flashes across Kenny's face] 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29101,Cartman,"Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! [Terrance and the woman stand up] "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29138,Cartman,Weak. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29172,Cartman,"Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29184,Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29227,Cartman,"We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29263,Cartman,"Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29302,Cartman,Alright! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29305,Cartman,"[rolling Kenny over so he can see] Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29313,Cartman,"Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29315,Cartman,Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29317,Cartman,[softly] God! She didn't take this long to die. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29320,Cartman,Great. Now can we go? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29322,Cartman,Ogh! God-damnit..! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29325,Cartman,"[impatient, arms crossed] Mom, I wanna go home! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29328,Cartman,Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh... 
5,6,Cartmanland,29330,Cartman,"[under his breath] Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29332,Cartman,[stunned] Hoosajiggawha? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29337,Cartman,"Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29339,Cartman,"No, no, wait, you don't understand. [voice trembles] since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars... "
5,6,Cartmanland,29341,Cartman,Egh... [lets out four long screams while his family watches] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29359,Cartman,"[softly] Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29361,Cartman,"I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29363,Cartman,On my dream. [zoom in] On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember... 
5,6,Cartmanland,29366,Cartman,"Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29368,Cartman,"Huh, I think God has plenty of money. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29370,Cartman,"Not much, just taking my [stops the wagon and shows a stack of bill off] one million dollars out of the bank. [the other three boys are stunned] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29373,Cartman,Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29375,Cartman,"HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29377,Cartman,"Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29386,Cartman,"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29390,Cartman,What?! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29394,Cartman,"Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29396,Cartman,"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out! [Chris and Frank look at each other] Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. [zoom in] But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds, [shot of people waiting to enter ""The Mine Shaft""] The rides are great, but... [a shot of crowds on Main Street] All the lines, lines, LINES! [shot of people waiting to enter a ghost ride, another shot of a kids' mine shaft ride; another of Cartman pissed off, eyes squeezed shut, with waiting times floating past him] If there's one thing I hate, [a shot of two lines of people entering his head] all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!! [opens his eyes, and a moment later...] And then there get to be so many people [his eyes roll around independently of each other] that they make FastPass. [a shot of people in a FastPass line] So then there's lines for FastPass. [zoom out to show Cartman in line for a FastPass] You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms [two lines for the Waterworks Restrooms], lines for the drinks [Astro Food line], lines for cantakuras [Seussian characters play strange instruments for the people in line] and rare Kartankulas Plinks! [a vendor sells them - they are a fruit treat shaped like strawberries] ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29399,Cartman,"Gentlemen, I thank you. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29407,Cartman,"[gleefully] Yyeessss! Yyeessss! [next, ""Java Jam!!"" a Teacup ride. Cartman laughs to himself] Awesome! [continues laughing. Next shot: Cartman in the ""Bumper Buggies"" bumper cars] Ho ho! [bumps into the car before him] Sweet! [bumps into the car behind him] Yes! [next shot: Cartman announcing at the Mine Shaft Ride] Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! [pulls the lever and the cars pull away. Cartman rushes to jump in the first car and buckles in. Outside, the cars go to one end of the ride] Yes! [the cars go to the other end of the ride] Yes! [next shot, goes to ""Ride Shots: pictures of your ride""] Oh, cool! [a picture of him on the ride appears on one screen] Oh, look how much fun I had! [next shot: a haunted ride. First, a mummy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheheheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Ah! Heheh. [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heh, heheh. [next shot, Cartman on a ferry around an island] Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome! [the island seems to have real animals there, like giraffes, elephants. Next shot, Cartman on a log ride, ""The Yeti."" He goes down the chute] Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! [lands in the lake below] Yehess! [comes to the end of the ride, sobs joyfully] I'm so happy! I'm so happy...! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29417,Cartman,"[voice, from the TV] Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides [Cartman stands next to a Yeti. When the log car comes out, he jumps in and takes off], six roller coasters [one of them is shown], and tons of great surprises! [a haunted tree and the Yeti do their stuff. Cartman is back at the front gate] And the best part is: [zoom in] You can't come!! [Stan and Kyle look confused. Next shot: Cartman on Main Street] That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister [a shot of the fancy new ride, with Cartman in one of the cars, going through the loops], a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! [an overview of Adventure Island, with Cartman showing it off] It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! [a shot of Cartman landing in a space capsule, with parachute] So come on down to Cartmanland now! [Cartman in the Haunted Mansion ride] But don't plan on getting past the parking lot, [back at the front gate] 'cause remember: [cue music] So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come! [cut music] Especially you, Stan and Kyle. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29422,Cartman,"[a mummy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Whoa! [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heheheheheh. [he exits the ride and ambles back to the road] Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the, um, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29424,Cartman,[lifts his hand to his ear to hear better] What the hell? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29426,Cartman,You sons of bitches! [goes towards the source of the sound] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29430,Cartman,[arriving] What the hell are you doing?! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29436,Cartman,"[reaches the scene, but stays inside the park] That's right! You stay out! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29441,Cartman,"...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29443,Cartman,"Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29445,Cartman,"[looks warily at the guard] But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29447,Cartman,"Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29449,Cartman,But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29451,Cartman,Ugh... Two people? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29453,Cartman,"Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park... "
5,6,Cartmanland,29455,Cartman,Sweet. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29471,Cartman,"[on the bullhorn] Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. [turns it off] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29474,Cartman,"I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29477,Cartman,The rest of you will just have to try another day. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29479,Cartman,"'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir. [Butters gives him the money and gets back change, his ticket, and a map of the park] Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29481,Cartman,"...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. [Clyde leaves] Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides. [walks in and dances down Main Street] Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! [enters the ride and makes his way through the line] Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah- [finds Clyde and Butters waiting for the ride as well. They turn to see him] What are you doing? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29483,Cartman,"Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? [Clyde and Butters lean away from Cartman, a bit afraid] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29486,Cartman,"Ugh, alright, alright, hang on. [pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Security! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29488,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29490,Cartman,But I don't know how it works. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29492,Cartman,"Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29494,Cartman,"[on the bullhorn] Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day. [a shot of the crowd from the front, then one of Cartman] However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood? [everyone nods] Alright, let's go. [unhinges the velvet rope, and in walk Tolkien, Timmy, Filmore and friend, Kenny, two adults, Bebe, and another boy] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29496,Cartman,[eyes the new boy and stops him] Wait a minute! Who are you? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29498,Cartman,"HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29500,Cartman,I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29502,Cartman,Get him out of here! [Stan looks up in surprise] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29505,Cartman,"Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides! [smiles and walks into the park. Next shot, Cartman in a roller coaster. Next, Cartman on ""Plummet from the Summit""] Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared! [reaches the top of the ride, then the car goes into free fall] AAAGGGHHH.... "
5,6,Cartmanland,29534,Cartman,"[checking off items on a clipboard] ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day... [the clipboard reads, ""Cartmanland Expenses.""] Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... [under his breath] God-damnit! [picks up the bullhorn and says] Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! [the crowd hoots and hollers and surges forward, engulfing Cartman. The people rush towards the one open ticket booth] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29555,Cartman,"[Bumped from ahead by car #9, Clyde] Eh! [Bumped from ahead by car #4, Kevin] Goddamnit, stop running into me! [at the Mine Shaft Ride he sits in the fist car, but is not enjoying it with all those other kids. Kenny is in the last car] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29557,Cartman,AGH! [he's next in The Yeti log ride with older kids] DAAGGHHHH!! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29562,Cartman,"[approaches] Hey, there you are! [The two men see him] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29564,Cartman,Just give me my money back. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29566,Cartman,I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29568,Cartman,"You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29571,Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! [scares the hell out of the boy. The father holds on to the boy] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29579,Cartman,"Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! [three men in suits approach Cartman] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29581,Cartman,[turns to face them] Yeah? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29583,Cartman,"He-hey, that's my money! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29585,Cartman,What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29587,Cartman,"Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29589,Cartman,"No! But I don't... ah... ah... [sees Mr. Fun through a fence and rushes to talk to him] Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29591,Cartman,"But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29593,Cartman,This can't be happening! AGGGHH!! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29601,Cartman,"It isn't fair! [throws another stone] You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! [throws another. Stan arrives with the doctor, the nurse, Kyle, and Kyle's parents] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29604,Cartman,"You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! [throws another stone] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29606,Cartman,"I'M SO PISSED OFF! [the security guard arrives, ready to spray Cartman] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29608,Cartman,"Ey! You used to work for me! [the guard sprays Cartman in the face] Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! [coughs and wheezes. Stan grins and Kyle's vital stats get stronger. Kyle sighs] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29612,Cartman,"Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29616,Cartman,"It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! [Kyle looks at Cartman, then up at the sky, then sits up and removes the oxygen mask] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29626,Cartman,"[runs up excitedly] Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29628,Cartman,"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! [goes away, and Stan and Kyle follow] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29632,Cartman,"Watch this. It's sooo funny. [grins] Come 'ere, Garland, come on. [giggles as he starts jacking the dog's penis] Good dog. [the dog rolls over on its back ] Red rocket red rocket. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Kenny starts to laugh and clap, and the dog's penis lengthens] Red rocket. Red rocket. [chuckles] Come on. [giggles] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29634,Cartman,I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29637,Cartman,"[continues milking] Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it. [concentrates on the dog] Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket! [the dogs ejaculates, and the semen lands on Cartman's face] Ohooohhh! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29640,Cartman,I told you guys. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29642,Cartman,"[sighs] Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29644,Cartman,[rolls his eyes up] That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off. [looks at Kenny] Don't you guys know anything? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29646,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! [laughs as a gray dog approaches] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29733,Cartman,AIDS? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29736,Cartman,Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29759,Cartman,"Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29800,Cartman,"Just put it on, Butters. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29802,Cartman,"Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29807,Cartman,"I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29814,Cartman,Do you feel protected? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29847,Cartman,"Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. [takes a condom just filled with urine and tosses it at the trashcan. It hits the side and splatters the urine next to the can.] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29849,Cartman,I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29851,Cartman,So I don't get AIDS. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29858,Cartman,I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29882,Cartman,"Here, talk to them, Butters. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29884,Cartman,"Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29889,Cartman,"Oh, bitch! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29934,Cartman,"Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29959,Cartman,"Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! [a dog enters the scene, and the camera begins to zoom out. Everyone is smiling and looking on as Cartman pleases the dog] That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now. "
5,8,Towelie,29968,Cartman,Let a man take a crap! 
5,8,Towelie,29972,Cartman,"[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper. "
5,8,Towelie,29974,Cartman,"Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody. "
5,8,Towelie,29977,Cartman,"[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it] "
5,8,Towelie,29979,Cartman,Why? 
5,8,Towelie,29981,Cartman,"[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive. "
5,8,Towelie,29983,Cartman,This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller. 
5,8,Towelie,29990,Cartman,"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys! "
5,8,Towelie,29996,Cartman,"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window] "
5,8,Towelie,30012,Cartman,"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere. "
5,8,Towelie,30020,Cartman,"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it. "
5,8,Towelie,30022,Cartman,"Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. ""Oh!""] "

5,8,Towelie,30047,Cartman,That's... so... cool! 
5,8,Towelie,30052,Cartman,It's Monday? 
5,8,Towelie,30068,Cartman,"What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.] "
5,8,Towelie,30077,Cartman,"Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.] "
5,8,Towelie,30085,Cartman,"[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No! "
5,8,Towelie,30089,Cartman,"Hey, towel! "
5,8,Towelie,30094,Cartman,"Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh! "

5,8,Towelie,30240,Cartman,"I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid! "
5,8,Towelie,30242,Cartman,"Yeah, and you're a towel! "
5,8,Towelie,30266,Cartman,"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we? "
5,8,Towelie,30302,Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level. "
5,8,Towelie,30309,Cartman,Could you turn it up? 
5,8,Towelie,30314,Cartman,"Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan] "

5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30350,Cartman,...Not really. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30362,Cartman,Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30364,Cartman,"Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those? "

5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30371,Cartman,HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30373,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30375,Cartman,"That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents? [cue soft music. Cartman stands on his seat] Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids. [now standing on his desk] There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30377,Cartman,"Yes, but they're sand monkeys! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30379,Cartman,"[drops into his seat angrily] God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30426,Cartman,"Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30435,Cartman,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30442,Cartman,"It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30453,Cartman,"Oh no, not Towelie. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30457,Cartman,"[quickly] No, we don't wanna get high!! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30459,Cartman,That's right! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30496,Cartman,"[he and the other two peek in] Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please? "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30500,Cartman,"[turns around and wrestles with the door] Aw, son of a bitch! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30508,Cartman,"[giggles] Uh ho, you guys. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30518,Cartman,"[""It didn't smell that bad you guys are overreacting. ""]"
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30520,Cartman,"Uh, whatever! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30522,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30526,Cartman,"God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30531,Cartman,What is this? The freakin' Flintstones? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30542,Cartman,"It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. [the Afghan boys are insulted] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30548,Cartman,What did you call us?! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30554,Cartman,I told you! Jawas have no heart. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30556,Cartman,"You know, sand people. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30561,Cartman,"[softly] God, I hate you so much, Stan! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30564,Cartman,"Ey, what the hell are you talking about?! [Stan and Kyle look at Cartman angrily] I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30568,Cartman,"Dude, don't call me a Canadian! [the protesters lead the captives up a mountain road. A bird in a tree warbles an Arabic song. When the lead protester reaches the tree he shoots the bird, and the bird falls down and away, dead. The trek resumes] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30571,Cartman,"Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a- "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30577,Cartman,"[leaning away] Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30614,Cartman,I'm gonna go take care of this prick! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30616,Cartman,"He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. [walks off] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30618,Cartman,"Mehah... [bites on some food] What's up, bin Laden? "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30620,Cartman,"Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray. [quickly rushes for a prayer rug and rolls it out, then kneels and bows deeply a few times.] Allah, Allah, m'heh "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30622,Cartman,Uh oh! Mmm-mm! [kisses Osama and tumbles away] 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30633,Cartman,Hey look! An infidel! [bin Laden quickly turns around] 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30635,Cartman,So that's what this is all about? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30637,Cartman,[climbs up bin Laden and kisses him] Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30639,Cartman,"Woohoo! [zips away, leaving a dust cloud front of bin Laden. Bin Laden gives chase, leaving his own dust cloud.] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30654,Cartman,"Haduqaduqaduqa. [Osama's tongue has rolled out to the floor. He tugs it and it rolls up like a classroom projection screen] Huqadukadukadukaduuu. [Osama whistles and then lustily howls like a wolf as he stomps his foot down on the ground. Cartman hops off the camel, walks some distance, and bats his eyes at bin Laden. Osama takes big steps towards Cartman, and the camera alternates between the two. Bin Laden stops short of Cartman... and leaps over him, landing on the camel's neck. Bin Laden starts kissing the camel all over, and Cartman removes his veil, looks at bin Laden, then looks at the camera] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30663,Cartman,There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! [hauls bin Laden away.] 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30665,Cartman,"Hur-ry, get into wardrobe! [bin Laden goes behind the walll and changes clothes. Cartman taps his foot impatiently] Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?! [bin Laden comes out dressed as Uncle Sam] Oh, you look marvelous, dahling. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30667,Cartman,"Come on! The cameras are ready! [pulls bin Laden to his mark. Behind them, eight Taliban soldiers fire away at the Americans] Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras. [walks off and returns with a director's megaphone and a firecracker] Oh, and here's your microphone. [hands Osama the firecracker] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30702,Cartman,Yeah. [follows the other two out] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30711,Cartman,"[rushes up, giddily breathless] You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30713,Cartman,"Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! [points]. Kenny, Kenny, over here! [Kenny comes in looking as Cartman described, with his hands on the floor and his feet in the air, laughing uncontrollably. After Kenny stands still, Cartman roars with laughter] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30715,Cartman,"Yes it is! [while this is going on, the other kids get their pictures taken, Tolkien being the last one. He hops off the stool and walks away.] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30717,Cartman,"...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30727,Cartman,Uh oh. [laughs]

5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30742,Cartman,[rushes up and takes Kenny's photos] Let me see! [returns to his seat. Stan and Kyle look at Cartman curiously while Kenny looks on angrily] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30744,Cartman,"[opens Kenny's envelope and looks at the photo, then roars with laughter] Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30746,Cartman,[Laughs] Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! [laughs some more]

5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30754,Cartman,"Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny. [Kenny looks over] I just had the greatest idea... ever! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30757,Cartman,"Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? [stifles a laugh] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30759,Cartman,"Yes, I have it right hmya. [shows her Kenny's school photo] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30761,Cartman,"You will? [tries not to laugh, but some escapes] Ah. [stifles another laugh] Oh, ah, thank you for your help. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30763,Cartman,"Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. [sniggers, then laughs] Brown eye! [laughs some more under his breath] "

5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30767,Cartman,"[cracks up] Full cheeks! [laughs] Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! [cracks up] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30771,Cartman,[between the laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! [laughs uncontrollably]

5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30783,Cartman,"Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! [falls to the floor, pounding the carpet with his fists in hysterics] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30785,Cartman,"Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30787,Cartman,"No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30815,Cartman,"[gets up and hops off the sofa] Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. [tries to compose himself] Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right? [wipes some moisture from his face] And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. [cracks up again] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30817,Cartman,"No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! [waits a second, then roars with laughter again] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30819,Cartman,"Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!! [roars with laughter again. The doorbell rings and all three look at the door] Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh. [walks over to answer the door. He stops and stifle a laugh] Just- okay [chuckles] No. [takes a few steps] Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. [steps to the door, takes a deep breath, and opens it, grinning] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30821,Cartman,Oh God. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30825,Cartman,"[very softly] Oh my... God. [walks away from the door quite afraid, then begins to ascend the stairs stammering nonsense] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30839,Cartman,"You guys, something's wrong. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30841,Cartman,I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30843,Cartman,[turns to face them] It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded. [turns away] I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30868,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever? "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30870,Cartman,Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30872,Cartman,"You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30874,Cartman,[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey] So does that mean I'll never laugh again? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30876,Cartman,Ugh. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30909,Cartman,"[out of sorts] Oh, dude, oh. "

5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30941,Cartman,"Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! [goes inside, and Jimmy follows, closing the door] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30943,Cartman,"Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30945,Cartman,I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30947,Cartman,"Okay, let me have it. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30949,Cartman,"Okay, why? "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30951,Cartman,"...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing. "

5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31001,Cartman,"Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31003,Cartman,And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31005,Cartman,Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.Eric. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31013,Cartman,[walking up to the other boys] What's goin' on? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31022,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck. [breaks into a grin and starts laughing] Ben Assfleck, say that's funny. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31024,Cartman,"Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! [laughs some more.] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31026,Cartman,"A-heh, what? "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31031,Cartman,"E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31033,Cartman,"[silent sigh] Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! [Kenny follows Cartman, and they begin to cross the road. Kenny remains behind Cartman, and the sound of a motorcycle draws close] "
5,11,The Entity,31134,Cartman,What's that thing? 
5,11,The Entity,31138,Cartman,What? 
5,11,The Entity,31140,Cartman,Forty bucks? 
5,11,The Entity,31142,Cartman,"Alright, alright. "
5,11,The Entity,31144,Cartman,"Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls? "
5,11,The Entity,31147,Cartman,[pulls back and mulls his chances] Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot. 
5,11,The Entity,31152,Cartman,"[weakening] ...Oh, man. "
5,11,The Entity,31154,Cartman,"[snaps into action] Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. [at that moment, a large wheel zips by the bus stop, and the kids cover their eyes] "
5,11,The Entity,31167,Cartman,"[resisting an urge] Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it. "
5,11,The Entity,31169,Cartman,[resisting mightily] I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars! 
5,11,The Entity,31177,Cartman,"Ugh, ugh! "
5,11,The Entity,31181,Cartman,Oh! 
5,11,The Entity,31183,Cartman,"Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit! "
5,11,The Entity,31202,Cartman,"[offscreen] Kyle, Kyle! [arrives] I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps. "
5,11,The Entity,31204,Cartman,"Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea. "
5,11,The Entity,31206,Cartman,"No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan. [Kyle Two gets even angrier] What a misunderstanding, huh? [tries to be chummy with Kyle. Kyle brushes him off] "
5,11,The Entity,31208,Cartman,"Goddamnit, give me another chance! "
5,11,The Entity,31212,Cartman,"Haha, [slaps him on the back] serves you right, asshole. [leaves] "
5,11,The Entity,31277,Cartman,[leaving] He's faaahn. 
5,11,The Entity,31336,Cartman,"[turns toward the landing gear and buried his face in a wheel, then starts counting] 1, 2, 3, 4... "
5,11,The Entity,31342,Cartman,[leaving] He's faaahn. 
5,11,The Entity,31380,Cartman,Heheheheheh. [the door is heard opening and they realize what Kyle just told them] 
5,11,The Entity,31388,Cartman,"[steps forth] I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait. "
5,11,The Entity,31394,Cartman,"[turns to Kyle] ...Good job, Jew! "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31400,Cartman,"[wrapping something together] Stand by, please. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31402,Cartman,"[leaving his seat] Oh, god dammit! "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31404,Cartman,"Shutup, Jew! [moves to the clearing, turns around, and faces the class. He clears his throat] Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31406,Cartman,Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS! 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31408,Cartman,I'll make you eat your parents! 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31410,Cartman,Nothing! [takes his seat] 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31417,Cartman,"Aw, that is such bullcrap! "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31419,Cartman,"No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Tolkien was able to do all that is because his family is rich! "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31421,Cartman,"Oh, come on, Tolkien! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?! "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31424,Cartman,"[leaves his seat and walks over to Tolkien] Let's just see where Tolkien's clothes come from, shall we? [tugs at his sweater] Ooooo, Armani Exchange! "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31426,Cartman,"All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Tolkien?! [Tolkien opens his mouth to say something, but shuts it up instead] I didn't think so! [moves back to his seat.] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31463,Cartman,"Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31467,Cartman,"Hey, you changed your clothes, Tolkien. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31475,Cartman,"Not too expensive for Tolkien's rich ass family, apparently. [the others laugh and gether around Tolkien] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31478,Cartman,"[takes the DVD and holds it up] Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. [the others laugh] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31480,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, dude. [Lowers the disk and laughs with the others] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31612,Cartman,What in the hell are they doing? 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31615,Cartman,"Well, let's just play our game, then. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31617,Cartman,"Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! [goes over and kicks Kenny in the nuts - Roshambo has begin!] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31621,Cartman,"Kick his nutsack! [kicks Kyle in the nuts. Stan kicks Kenny in the nuts. Tolkien rides up and stops to watch the boys while the game continues. Soon, a player and horse ram into his and knocks him and his horse away - It's Frederick.] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31744,Cartman,Uh huh. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31746,Cartman,Yeah. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31748,Cartman,Hey. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31750,Cartman,"Ey, you did me already! "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31757,Cartman,"[walks past Tolkien, behind Kyle] Pussy. [Pip walks by without saying anything] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31792,Cartman,[rides along] My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm. [sees the trashed truck and its contents] What do we have heah? [strokes his chin] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31813,Cartman,"Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31815,Cartman,Guess what I have sitting in my back yard? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31817,Cartman,Better. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31819,Cartman,Better. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31821,Cartman,Better. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31823,Cartman,Thirty-three aborted fetuses. [the boys look back at him for a long time] Oh yes. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31825,Cartman,"Mint condition, tax free. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31828,Cartman,"Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31830,Cartman,"Stem cells, numbnuts! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31835,Cartman,"[points at Kyle] It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31837,Cartman,Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own! 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31839,Cartman,"Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it. [later] Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. [later] Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. [later] I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake. [suddenly grins and covers the receiver with his right hand] That's a joke [removes his hand from the receiver] ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye. [hangs up and relaxes, putting his feet up on his desk and his hands behind his head] Damn I'm good.  "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31842,Cartman,"Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31844,Cartman,"[rips out a bill...] Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31847,Cartman,"[picks up and carries a box] You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31849,Cartman,"...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31853,Cartman,"[Cartman's mouth opens in disbelief, then he gets angry] Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! [throws the box down on the floor, breaking it and spilling its contents. Now there are thirty-two aborted fetuses] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31881,Cartman,"Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.:[later. There are now thirty-one] Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. [hangs up and sighs deeply]  "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31883,Cartman,"Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31885,Cartman,"[shifts in his chair] Buh, alright. [Liane leaves] eh, Butters? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31887,Cartman,Are you through databasing the clientele sheet? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31889,Cartman,"[leaving his chair and heading for his door] Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31891,Cartman,[turns around] Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31894,Cartman,"What is this, a PTA meeting? [before him stand his mother, Sheila, Kyle, and Stan. Stan's head hangs forward as he looks down] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31896,Cartman,[shock and distress flashes across his face] In the ...hospital? Why? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31898,Cartman,[more worried] Die? Kenny? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31901,Cartman,"Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. [turns and goes up the stairs] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31911,Cartman,We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31913,Cartman,"Heh, sorry. [Stan remains speechless. Kenny looks at his friends and coughs violently] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31928,Cartman,"[with emotion in his voice] ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31931,Cartman,"Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! [walks towards the door. The nurse leaves, then Cartman exits] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31934,Cartman,"[composes himself] Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? [sniffles] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31936,Cartman,"' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh. [breaks down again, but tries to hide it] Oh man. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31938,Cartman,"I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31942,Cartman,"Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31944,Cartman,"Not at all, but go on. [they both turn and approach a table. On the table is a cage with a rat inside it.] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31946,Cartman,My God... 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31948,Cartman,"So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31950,Cartman,"Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31952,Cartman,Hmmm. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31954,Cartman,Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. [turns around and heads for the exit] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31956,Cartman,"There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31958,Cartman,"Oh, doctor. [Larry turns around. Cartman has his thumb up] Thanks. Thanks. [Larry returns the gesture with his own thumb up, and Cartman leaves again.] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31960,Cartman,"Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. [walks away] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32000,Cartman,"My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds. [a shot of Congress] I love Kenny McCormick and... [sob] I want you to love him too. [cries as Congresspeople look to each other] And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song [takes a deep breath]  It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant The heat of the moment shone in your eyes I never meant to be so bad to you One thing I said that I would never do   "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32007,Cartman,"And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32009,Cartman,"Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32011,Cartman,"[hands the clipboard over for her to sign the release form] Great, just sign right here, please. [another woman arrives] Hi. Havin' an abortion today? [Jill hands him the clipboard back, then heads for the clinic] Great. [to the second woman] Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there. [she nods and reaches for the clipboard.] And you sign right here. [hands her the clipboard and she signs. A couple passes by] Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? [the second woman enters the clinic] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32013,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32016,Cartman,Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,32031,Cartman,You guys! Come quick! [Stan and Kyle look surprised] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,32033,Cartman,"It's... [Cartman turns around] Why, it's a miracle, you guys! [rushes out the door to a spot on the side of the road. Stan and Kyle follow.] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32036,Cartman,"Look. [across the street stands a Shakey's Pizza] I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's! [oozing sounds are heard as a new Shakey's is indeed rising up next to the current one] It worked! [Kyle is shocked.] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32038,Cartman,Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's! 
5,13,Kenny Dies,32040,Cartman,"I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies, [Kyle turns and faces him angrily] and I can finish up the kitchen. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32042,Cartman,Aah! Kyle! [Kyle punches him across the face a few times] Kyle! [Kyle delivers a series of punches to the chest] 
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32349,Cartman,Huho! 
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32359,Cartman,We sure are. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32368,Cartman,"[dialing] Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. [the boys quiet down and cover their mouths as the call goes through to City Wok, a Chinese restaurant.] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32370,Cartman,"[the boys giggle] Hello, is this City Wok? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32372,Cartman,"[the boys giggle harder] Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32390,Cartman,"[hops off and follows Stan and Kyle] Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32400,Cartman,That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32409,Cartman,A- AIDS? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32427,Cartman,Oh-my-god! [turns around] You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32429,Cartman,"Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32431,Cartman,"[softly] That's right Stan. [bolder] It's a cash cow, I tell you. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32433,Cartman,Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32435,Cartman,"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32437,Cartman,"I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32439,Cartman,"That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32442,Cartman,"Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32447,Cartman,He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32450,Cartman,[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32472,Cartman,"Uuuh, school project. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32485,Cartman,Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32487,Cartman,So how long until we can joke about it? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32489,Cartman,"Wugh, that's a long time to wait. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32491,Cartman,Then eat your puke. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32493,Cartman,"Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. [Butters looks at Cartman, then at his puke. Reluctantly he scoops it up and eats it.] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32516,Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself, man! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32520,Cartman,"Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32524,Cartman,[pointing to Butters] The fat one! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32529,Cartman,Just like Jared. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32532,Cartman,"Sir, we are in business! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32544,Cartman,"[heard from the outside] Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again! [the camera goes inside. People are exercising on all sorts of equipment. A woman runs by on a track on the second floor. Butters is pulling at a rowing machine as Cartman spots him. Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs and barking orders] You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32546,Cartman,"[normal] Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32548,Cartman,[barking] Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32559,Cartman,"[steps in between them] Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32561,Cartman,"Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32563,Cartman,I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32565,Cartman,"Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32570,Cartman,"Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32572,Cartman,"No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32578,Cartman,Check. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32582,Cartman,That should blah [babbles a bit] ah- here. [cuts into Butters' abdomen] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32584,Cartman,Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32586,Cartman,Alrighty. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32588,Cartman,"Alright, I think it's in. [turns around] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32590,Cartman,"[spits out the hose as soon as the fat hits his lips] Bohogh, egh. [puts the hose into the pail for the fat to collect] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32592,Cartman,There it goes. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32594,Cartman,"[wipes away a bit of fat remaining on his lips] Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32599,Cartman,"[looks at the fat flowing out] Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32601,Cartman,"Oh, whoa. Whoa! [the fat rushes out so quickly the tube begins to buck, splattering fat and blood all over the place] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32605,Cartman,"Oh, crap! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32634,Cartman,"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32638,Cartman,"Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was? [whispers] God. [normally] He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32640,Cartman,"Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32642,Cartman,"[begins sounding something like Butters. Kyle looks on] Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32645,Cartman,"Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! [the others leave and he closes the door] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32647,Cartman,['Eh. [makes himself comfortable on the sofa and turns on the TV. He grunts a bit] Eh. Yeah. [the phone rings he answers] Well hello? ']
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32649,Cartman,"Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32651,Cartman,"Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32653,Cartman,"Ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32655,Cartman,"Bring it on, queer bait. [hangs up] Aaaahhhh, yes! [puts his arms behind his head, quite satisfied with himself] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32678,Cartman,[answering] Hello? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32680,Cartman,"Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32682,Cartman,"Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32684,Cartman,"Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank. [hangs up] Eh. [resumes eating] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32733,Cartman,"[opens the door in anticipation] There you are, Butters! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32735,Cartman,"No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32737,Cartman,"No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32739,Cartman,"Here you go. [hands Butters some drawings] I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32741,Cartman,Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. [makes his way to the door] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32743,Cartman,"Butters, it was my pleasure. [pulls out his mittens and opens the door, then puts them on. He heads for the sidewalk humming a late night theme song, then turns around to frame the house with his fingers, then walks away] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32752,Cartman,"Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now. "
6,2,Asspen,32762,Cartman,"[alerting the other two] Look you guys, Butters is asleep. "
6,2,Asspen,32764,Cartman,"Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? [drops down] When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water, [takes a glass of water and brings it to Butters' hand] and you put their hand in it... [dunks Butters' hand in it] "
6,2,Asspen,32766,Cartman,"And then, you pee on it! [drops his pants and pees on Butters' hand] heheh-heheheheheheheh. "
6,2,Asspen,32768,Cartman,"[still peeing] Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh. "
6,2,Asspen,32794,Cartman,"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny! "
6,2,Asspen,32796,Cartman,"So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler. "
6,2,Asspen,32798,Cartman,"You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone? "
6,2,Asspen,32800,Cartman,"Shh-shh, here he comes. "
6,2,Asspen,32802,Cartman,"[knowingly] Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?! "
6,2,Asspen,32814,Cartman,"I don't smell anything. Do you guys? [bursts out laughing. Stan and Kyle just look at him as Butters looks up, wondering...] "
6,2,Asspen,32817,Cartman,"Yeah, well, that's why they call it Asspen. [laughs at his cleverness. A skier skis up to them] "
6,2,Asspen,32819,Cartman,[to Stan] His name is Thumper? 
6,2,Asspen,32853,Cartman,"Ugh, no more., [Kyle skis on. Stan is skiing as well, and another skier comes up to him, showering him with snow] "
6,2,Asspen,32953,Cartman,"Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. [the music is stopped and a voice is heard] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33076,Cartman,"That's awesome, Kenny. [""Kenny"" removes his hood, and it's Butters] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33086,Cartman,"Aww, sick dude! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33108,Cartman,Oh YES!! [gets off the sofa and heads for the phone] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33112,Cartman,"Shhh. Be quite, you guys! [talks to someone on the phone] Hello, is this Maury Povich? [beat] Oh, well who the hell are you? [beat] Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks? [Stan grins, Kyle stifles a laugh] Ye-right, people with disabilities? [beat] Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show. [beat] Great! [beat] Hih-his condition? [beat] Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis."" [beat] Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin. [Stan stilfes a laugh and closes his eyes, then Butters stifles a laugh. All of them giggle. Cartman tells the others] Shut uh- shut up you guys. [beat, then on the phone] Yes. [beat] Yes, of course he's very upset about it. [beat] Yes, he cries all the time. [beat] Miserable, uh huh. [beat] You wha- Really? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33114,Cartman,"Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33117,Cartman,"Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show. [trying to be subtle] There will of course be a prize involved? [beat] Great. I'll call you back in an hour. [gladly] No, thank you. [hangs up] YES! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33126,Cartman,"[hops off the chair] Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crazy masks and special effects for their dumb movies. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33131,Cartman,Yeah. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33138,Cartman,"Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33140,Cartman,Yeah. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33147,Cartman,Nice. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33152,Cartman,"They look great on you, Butters. They really do. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33159,Cartman,"Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. [the Trekkers begin to fight over the tape. Butters checks his new balls self-consciously] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33165,Cartman,"Okay, here's your ticket [hands it to Butters] and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. [pushes him forward] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33169,Cartman,"God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33172,Cartman,Buh-ters! Buh-ters!

6,3,Freak Strike,33224,Cartman,"Uh oh, we're losin' him. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33231,Cartman,"Oh, that was close. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33240,Cartman,The present. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33244,Cartman,"Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33248,Cartman,Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33250,Cartman,"Hello, is this the Maury Povich show? [beat] Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin. [strokes his ""balls""] I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33252,Cartman,What's the new topic? 
6,3,Freak Strike,33254,Cartman,"Oh. Hey, I'm out of control! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33256,Cartman,"Uh, sure! "

6,3,Freak Strike,33268,Cartman,"I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33270,Cartman,"Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33272,Cartman,"Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother. [turns around and walks out] Such a beautiful mother. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33317,Cartman,"Jeez, that girl is pissed off. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33324,Cartman,"[under his breath] But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize. [leaves the room and finds the stagehand] Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33351,Cartman,"Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt! [brings out a lollipop] I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! "

6,3,Freak Strike,33361,Cartman,[hops off his chair and tries the audience] What-evah! What-evah! [snaps his left-hand fingers back and forth] I'll do what I waunt! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33363,Cartman,Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! [sits back down] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33365,Cartman,"What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33395,Cartman,I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!

6,3,Freak Strike,33416,Cartman,[hops off his chair and steps forward] Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! [more audience members leave] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33424,Cartman,"Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! [rips the balls off Butters' chin. The freaks react immediately and fall silent] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33428,Cartman,Aaahh! [three freaks trail behind with a boiling pot of water] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33441,Cartman,They look so delicious. [Kyle looks at him] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33446,Cartman,[raises his arm up with glee] Memememee! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33454,Cartman,"Oh, man, look at that one! [moves towards the calves] It looks delicious. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33456,Cartman,"Mm, succulent and juicy. [reaches the calf he was eyeing] Can we have a free sample of these, too? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33458,Cartman,Alriiight! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33463,Cartman,"[responding to a dream] No, Uncle Jesse, no! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33465,Cartman,[wakes up and sees his friends] What? What the hell are you guys doing?? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33467,Cartman,Where are we going? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33469,Cartman,What? Why? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33471,Cartman,So? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33473,Cartman,"Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass"", ""butthole"", and ""douchebag"". I really don't feel like you guys's friend. [lies back down and closes his eyes] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33477,Cartman,[sits up] Oho! So you need me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering Playset! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33479,Cartman,"Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. [turns his ass to Kyle, lowers his pants and underwear, and waits] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33481,Cartman,Just give it a little kiss and I'll help. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33483,Cartman,"Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss. [softly] Kiss it. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33486,Cartman,Kiss it. Come on. [gruffly] Kiss it. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33489,Cartman,"No, it has to be Kyle. [turns away. Kyle resists for a few moments, then slowly moves his face towards Cartman's ass through the window. Kyle finally reaches the ass and Cartman unleashes a juicy fart. Kyle withdraws in fits and starts] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33491,Cartman,"[laughs uproariously] Oh man, that was soho awesome! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33494,Cartman,"Hell, I'm not goin' with you! [lies back down and closes his eyes again] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33496,Cartman,Heeeey! [rolls off the bed and the wrestling continues] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33500,Cartman,"[heaves and takes the torch from Stan] Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask [hands it to Stan] and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. [opens the gas valve and lights the gas stream. A blue flame shoots out and the other boys jump back.] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33503,Cartman,[peers down. Butters and Kyle join him] You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33505,Cartman,"Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33507,Cartman,"O! At least I have an ass, Jew! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33512,Cartman,See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33519,Cartman,"I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33523,Cartman,Eh! [follows] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33525,Cartman,"Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. [pushes the calf further across the ice] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33527,Cartman,"Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33573,Cartman,I want out. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33579,Cartman,Yeah! Wait-what? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33605,Cartman,"[weakening] Oh, God-damnit you guys. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33610,Cartman,"We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33627,Cartman,"Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33629,Cartman,Can't go on. Need... food... 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33631,Cartman,"There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33633,Cartman,All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. [points] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33637,Cartman,Food! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33645,Cartman,Look you guys! Beef jerky! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33654,Cartman,"Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33656,Cartman,"Go ahead, that's more for us. [tempts the calf next to him with some beef jerky] You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry? [the calf starts chewing on it] Who's the hungry man? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33680,Cartman,Hippies! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33686,Cartman,"What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33711,Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and takes over] Dah, give me that! [takes the receiver from Stan] Talk to me Mike. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33713,Cartman,"Sure, sure. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33715,Cartman,What do you have in mind? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33717,Cartman,"Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33719,Cartman,"All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... - "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33722,Cartman,"[clears his throat] We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33724,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33726,Cartman,"Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33735,Cartman,[answers the ringing phone] Hello. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33737,Cartman,"All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. [in the background, Kyle takes out the guns, tossing them to Butters] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33739,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! [Butters assembles a machine gun while Kyle inspects a sword. Stan lies by a corner in a fetal position, on a calf, with more lesions appearing on his face] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33741,Cartman,"We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! [Butters plays soldier in the background, moving his gun around and then saluting while Kyle practices some lunges] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33743,Cartman,"Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! [Kyle tosses a dud grenade at Butters, who hits it with a spear. The grenade flies off the bed and onto the floor. Kyle and Butters jump with joy] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33751,Cartman,"Mike, speak. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33753,Cartman,"We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33755,Cartman,"Good, good. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33757,Cartman,"Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33779,Cartman,And Worf? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33786,Cartman,Step back! Tell those men to step back! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33790,Cartman,"[heads for the street] Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies! [approaches the semi-truck, where Michael Dorn now sits at the wheel. He gets into the passenger side and sits] Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, and you must refer to me as ""Captain."" "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33792,Cartman,"No. See, you must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"" "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33794,Cartman,You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33796,Cartman,"[correcting Dorn] ""Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"" "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33798,Cartman,"[calls out] Okay, all set! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33804,Cartman,"Step on it, Mr. Worf! [the semi peels off] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33810,Cartman,"Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33812,Cartman,"[correcting gently] ""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"" "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33814,Cartman,"Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33819,Cartman,"[looks out] Oh, it's a double-cross!! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33824,Cartman,"What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33826,Cartman,Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33844,Cartman,Thank God we stopped it in time. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33858,Cartman,All right! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33881,Cartman,"Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are? "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33883,Cartman,"I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33899,Cartman,"Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? [points to Stan] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33901,Cartman,"Stan, okay. What's your name? [points to Kyle] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33903,Cartman,Kyle. What's your name? [looks at Butters] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33905,Cartman,"Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33910,Cartman,Amen. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33919,Cartman,"What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. [takes a hold of the remote] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33922,Cartman,"[leaves the sofa] Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. [heads for the television] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33924,Cartman,"Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? [moves the cable, and the vertical goes out of whack] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33926,Cartman,"Okay, how about ... that? [moves it again, and the cathode ray tube pops. The wall behind the TV is blackened, and Cartman slowly peeks] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33929,Cartman,"[panicked] It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33931,Cartman,I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33940,Cartman,[gruffly] Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33949,Cartman,[arrives breathless] Huh. Ohmigod! Huh. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33953,Cartman,"God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? [Gerald arrives with Ike] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33962,Cartman,Argh! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33964,Cartman,We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33969,Cartman,[trailing again] Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33980,Cartman,"There, you got it, you got it! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33983,Cartman,"Oh, thank God. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33985,Cartman,"We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34002,Cartman,"This TV is great, Chef. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34016,Cartman,Aagh! God-dammit! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34021,Cartman,[blubbering] This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34039,Cartman,Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34044,Cartman,"Oh, you've gotta be kidding me! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34050,Cartman,"Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! [once the boys are in place, Stan walks over to the TV and turns it on. ""Puppies From Around The World"" comes on, and Stan quickly changes the channel to the Russell Crowe show] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34077,Cartman,Here we go! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34080,Cartman,That's it? That's all the commercials? 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34090,Cartman,Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34105,Cartman,"Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34108,Cartman,Eewww! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34112,Cartman,"God, I hate old people! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34115,Cartman,And my house is being fumigated! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34135,Cartman,"[trailing the other three] Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me! [stops] Oh! I lost a doughnut! [turns around and heads back] Oooh! Oh oh! [stops] Oh my God! [turns around and tries to catch up with the others] Leave no doughnut behind! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34156,Cartman,"[glares at Butters and slowly gets angry] Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34162,Cartman,"The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! [Stan is the first to reach the remote control, so he takes it and turn on the TV] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34168,Cartman,These commercials are all so God-damn stupid! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34172,Cartman,"You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34178,Cartman,[tosses his popcorn into the air] Woohoo!!! [the popcorn showers all the boys as they begin to move around happily] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34182,Cartman,"[on the phone] Clyde, Clyde? Did you see it? [Stan jumps up on the sofa alongside Cartman] Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34184,Cartman,"You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34188,Cartman,"Yeah, it sure does! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34203,Cartman,I'll do it. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34205,Cartman,"Butters, could you take a seat, please? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34207,Cartman,"Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34209,Cartman,"Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap,"" so to speak. [wiggles the index and middle fingers of each hand as a quote gesture] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34211,Cartman,"Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34213,Cartman,"I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo... "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34215,Cartman,"Lame, yes. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34220,Cartman,"Yes, well, we weren't. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34223,Cartman,"[shakes Butters' left hand] But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by. [points to the door] You know the way out, right? [Butters look at the other two boys, who each returns a somber look. He gets off the chair, looks once more, then walks away dejectedly] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34227,Cartman,Who cares? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34236,Cartman,"[takes the mic] All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. [camera pans across the seated kids, then back to Cartman] Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34238,Cartman,"Clyde... [mouths something]... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34247,Cartman,"[on a blue sofa] I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. [cut to Jimmy entertaining Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, Clyde, and Craig] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34252,Cartman,"...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. [takes a sip of ZOOP soda] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34255,Cartman,"We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride. [cut to the log ride] The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line. [the boys are escorted to the first car, cut back to Cartman] That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and... "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34258,Cartman,"[the boys look at Jimmy] Oh, really? [turns to his note pad] That's gonna cost some points. [writes down some numbers as Jimmy is helped into the log.] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34267,Cartman,"All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten. [Kyle goes off to get the box of roses] If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out. [Kyle returns with the roses and sets them down] Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34272,Cartman,"Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34275,Cartman,"All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! [the others moan and leave their seats] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34293,Cartman,Next? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34295,Cartman,"Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34297,Cartman,Alrighty then. [the boys take their seats] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34309,Cartman,"Uh, what's the question again? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34311,Cartman,Five times one is of course... 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34313,Cartman,Five. [the door opens and Professor Chaos appears] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34324,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34327,Cartman,"[escorts Craig away] Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. [Craig leaves] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34335,Cartman,"All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34346,Cartman,"Just one more rose, Kyle. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34349,Cartman,"All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! [Craig, Clyde, Jason, and Luigi leave] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34351,Cartman,"Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34368,Cartman,[a shot of him on a sofa] The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. [a shot of the three boys making comments during judging. Cartman takes notes] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34371,Cartman,Next please. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34374,Cartman,"If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34376,Cartman,Very nice. [takes notes] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34386,Cartman,"You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34388,Cartman,"All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! [Pip leaves his seat and Tolkien comes in] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34390,Cartman,"Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34405,Cartman,I think Towelie is awesome. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34410,Cartman,"Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34412,Cartman,Tolkien's a smartass. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34414,Cartman,Yeah. Do we really need another one? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34417,Cartman,"[disgusted] Oh, thanks Jimmy. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34422,Cartman,"Alright Jimmy, see ya. [the door closes] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34434,Cartman,"Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. [the camera pans across the audience, showing the candidates close-up] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34436,Cartman,"Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? [another shot of the candidates] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34460,Cartman,"[off screen. Stan and Kyle look] You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! [excited, he rushes up and stands between then, holding an ad] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34462,Cartman,"Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34464,Cartman,"No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34466,Cartman,"Look! [the boys draw close. The ad is shown] Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34468,Cartman,Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34470,Cartman,"[shows irritation] Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on. [turns to Stan and Tweek and continues excitedly] Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34472,Cartman,"If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34496,Cartman,Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... [bubbles appear as Cartman dreams] Yesss... Yeesss... 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34498,Cartman," [shown floating down to the briny deep. Two pairs of sea arms catch him. The sea couple rights him and walk with him in the middle] Look at me, livin' free Free and clean amongst the Sea People [the sea couple and he sail by in a tiny pirate ship. They take him into the castle] We look for pirates and search for gold. Life is an adventure with the Sea People [A sea man pitches to Cartman, who bats the ball for a run. As a sea family looks on he blows out the candles on a cake.] They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat. They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that. [he rides a sea horse alongside sea people on horseback and grins at the camera] This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing, [Shown walking with the sea couple again.] Sea people and me. Sea people and me, you guys.   "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34500,Cartman,"Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. [closes his eyes and turns to his left side] Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. [goes to sleep] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34502,Cartman,"Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says [slowing down to read] ""Step 2. [grabs a small sack] Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly."" [smiles, then remembers something. He turns to face the other boys] Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34504,Cartman,"[turns to the tank] Hold the sign up, Kyle! [Kyle picks a sign up off the floor and holds it to his chest] Higher, Kyle! [Kyle raises it higher, in front of his face] Okay. [opens the egg sack and whispers] Here we go. [pours the eggs into the tank and taps the bag for good measure. Kyle moves the sign a bit so he could peek. Cartman grins again in anticipation, but it fades. Kyle lowers the sign to his chest. Cartman looks from various angles, then takes out the magnifying glass for a closer look. Two pale shrimp crawl around in the tank. Kyle drops the sign] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34506,Cartman,What the fuck is this?! [Stan approaches and looks in the tank] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34508,Cartman,I got RIPPED OFF! [pounds the desk and sets the box on the floor to his left] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34510,Cartman,"[approaches Kyle and confronts him] Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!! [moves on to Tweek] And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!! [his rant ended, he walks across the room] They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34513,Cartman,[at the window] Who cares?! Throw 'em away!! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34516,Cartman,"[brightly] Heheh, okay, okay. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34518,Cartman,"Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34520,Cartman,"[rushes to Tweek and covers his mouth] Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34557,Cartman,Tweek! Where are you going? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34562,Cartman,"In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34575,Cartman,"We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34586,Cartman,"Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34588,Cartman,"[whispers] Ugh. [then] Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34593,Cartman,Is it her? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34596,Cartman,"Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach! [the boys look at him, shocked] Oh, God! You guys are such pussies! [starts digging around in the belly] Hemmm... "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34599,Cartman,"No, just a bunch of goo. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34621,Cartman,"There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know. [looks at his hands] The blood is washed neatly from our hands. [the door opens and Chef enters with a bunch of stuff.] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34623,Cartman,"[stopping Chef] It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34632,Cartman,"Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34638,Cartman,"G'night, guys. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34640,Cartman,"[settling in] Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. [dozes off. The camera moves to the tank to look at the tank.] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34642,Cartman,[rushes up] H'you guys! Come quick! [turns and runs off] You won't believe it! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34645,Cartman,"Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! [the other three approach the tank. Cartman picks up the magnifying glass for a closer look] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34648,Cartman,"I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics. [brings out a small chalkboard with an equation written on it and points to the various parts of the equation] Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34652,Cartman,"That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them thrive. Tweek! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34654,Cartman,"You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34656,Cartman,Me? [camera closes in on him] I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34671,Cartman,"Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34673,Cartman,Do you have them or not? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34675,Cartman,What's your name? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34677,Cartman,"Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? [she looks at him and rises, moving off to her left.] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34679,Cartman,"[inspecting the vial] I see, very interesting. [pulls the cap off and pours the semen onto his left hand] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34681,Cartman,"Takin' a look here. [pulls out a portable microscope and inspects the semen between his left thumb and index finger. He stretches and squishes the semen. Frances looks on puzzled] Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34683,Cartman,"No, gallons. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34685,Cartman,"Dammit! Give me all you've got, then! [the seminal fluid slides down on his fingers] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34699,Cartman,"[entering] That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34702,Cartman,And I've got the sea men. [raises a bowl of semen up to the tank and begins scooping the fluid into the tank.] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34704,Cartman,"Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34706,Cartman,"Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh. [scoops out the last of the semen] There we go. [drops the empty bowl] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34708,Cartman,"Nothin' to do now but wait.[the boys huddle around the new, larger tank.] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34710,Cartman,"Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34714,Cartman,"Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years. [grabs his magnifier and looks at the society. It now looks Roman. He begins to speak in wonder] Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-? [spots a statue. It's one of him. Hundreds of sea people worship it] Oh. They think I'm God. [throws the magnifier away and rejoices] Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?! [runs to his window, throws the doors open and screams out] I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!! [his mom opens the door and takes some trash to the trash can next to the driveway] Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34722,Cartman,"[arrives, shown as Nelson] Ha ha! [Butters is just stunned.] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34724,Cartman,"Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34726,Cartman,"Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34728,Cartman,"I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34730,Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you, Butters? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34732,Cartman,"[everyone is silent for a few seconds, then] ...So? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34734,Cartman,"Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34740,Cartman,"Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34745,Cartman,"That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! [small explosions are seen and the tank jumps] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34749,Cartman,Yeah! Go! [two more explosions are seen] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34752,Cartman,"Oh God-damnit! [two missiles, one from behind each statue, fly towards the surface and back down towards their respective targets. The impacts both missiles create tear the tank apart and the sea people flood out of the tank. Screams are heard as they fall to the ground. Cartman is stunned, he looks and falls on his knees.] Oh no! Oh the humanity! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34755,Cartman,Why can't societies just live in peace? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34769,Cartman,I don't know. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34790,Cartman,Ih... in our... butt? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34810,Cartman,[thinking] Maybe... No. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34817,Cartman,"Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing? "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34820,Cartman,Hm. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34827,Cartman,"Aw, dude, I think I might have it. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34829,Cartman,"[gets up and starts pacing] It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right? "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34831,Cartman,"Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth. [long pause] Hm? "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34833,Cartman,"What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34835,Cartman,Have you ever tried it? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34837,Cartman,I bet you twenty bucks it'll work! 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34839,Cartman,"Okay, let's go, Jew! [Cartman rushes off and Kyle follow. Stan and Tweek remain seated on the curb.] "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34873,Cartman,"[turns to look at Kyle] Hold on! [turns back to the task at hand] God, let a man crap! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34878,Cartman,"I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34880,Cartman,"[looking at the boys] I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34882,Cartman,"Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?! [the other boys fix their gaze at him] Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. [tries again. A few spasms later and a big log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet. All the boys are stunned, even Cartman.] "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34884,Cartman,"[excited] Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth! [starts chanting] I crapped out my mo-outh! [walks over to Kyle] You owe me twenty bucks, dickface! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34904,Cartman,"Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. [puts his hands behind his back oh so modestly] "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34906,Cartman,"It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars! [Kyle gets upset] I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- [Kyle shuts the door on him, looks, then turns around and walks away from the door. Cartman pops up outside a window waving the bill at him. Kyle turns, goes to the window, and lowers the blinds, then walks off] "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34938,Cartman,"[arriving] You guys! You guys! Look! [he's dressed in a bathrobe, swim trunks, and sandals] "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34940,Cartman,I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34942,Cartman,"So? So now I can do this! [takes off his robe, throws the bills in the air, and rolls around in the floating bills.] Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34944,Cartman,"[luxuriating in the bills] Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34946,Cartman,"Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34952,Cartman,"[with a solid retort] That's stupid and immature, Cartman! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35000,Cartman,"[rushes up] You guys, you guys! [drags a small inflatable wading pool behind him] I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35002,Cartman,"So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long! [picks up the bag of quarters and prepares to pour them in] Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. [the quarters start pouring in, and Cartman gloats] "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35004,Cartman,"O-hoo, what's that, Kyle? "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35006,Cartman,Heh... [the smile vanishes] what? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35008,Cartman,"[taking time to figure out what that means...] You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! [kicks the pool and it deflates. He walks away angry. Stan and Kyle grin at each other - they planned this change in tactics. The parents arrive cheering and hollering] "
6,9,Free Hat,35029,Cartman,"Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing. "
6,9,Free Hat,35040,Cartman,"[they reach the ticket booth] Yeah, we want our money back! "
6,9,Free Hat,35042,Cartman,You asshole! [turns around and catches up with the other boys] 
6,9,Free Hat,35048,Cartman,Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit. 
6,9,Free Hat,35053,Cartman,"Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player! "
6,9,Free Hat,35055,Cartman,"Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU! "
6,9,Free Hat,35058,Cartman,"Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up! "
6,9,Free Hat,35060,Cartman,"Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. [takes the marker and adds the words ""FRee HAT"" at the very end.] "
6,9,Free Hat,35062,Cartman,"Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up. "
6,9,Free Hat,35064,Cartman,Well we can just make them out of paper. 
6,9,Free Hat,35066,Cartman,"It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?! "
6,9,Free Hat,35076,Cartman,[enormous face appearing over the clouds] Tweek! [brushes the clouds away with his hands] TWEEK!! [Tweek opens his eyes] TWEEK!! 
6,9,Free Hat,35078,Cartman,How many hats have you made? 
6,9,Free Hat,35080,Cartman,We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow! [slaps him hard across the back.] Get the lead out! 
6,9,Free Hat,35089,Cartman,"They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek! "
6,9,Free Hat,35094,Cartman,"[""Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Free hat!""] I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat. "
6,9,Free Hat,35103,Cartman,"[takes the mic] Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them. "
6,9,Free Hat,35132,Cartman,But just remember that I do all the talking. 
6,9,Free Hat,35134,Cartman,Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it. 
6,9,Free Hat,35136,Cartman,"Just now - [quickly, counting off with his left hand] 1 2 3 dibs! [punches his right palm with his left fist] "
6,9,Free Hat,35140,Cartman,What could possibly go wrong? 
6,9,Free Hat,35143,Cartman,"[blinks and looks at the camera for a long time] ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. [the camera moves from Cartman to Tweek] "
6,9,Free Hat,35158,Cartman,"[to Stan] Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [resumes gawking at the two] "
6,9,Free Hat,35162,Cartman,"Yeah, we're children. "
6,9,Free Hat,35164,Cartman,"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted. "
6,9,Free Hat,35166,Cartman,Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence? 
6,9,Free Hat,35176,Cartman,Thank you. [turns a page up and over. A schematic of George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch is shown] Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative. 
6,9,Free Hat,35188,Cartman,He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense? 
6,9,Free Hat,35199,Cartman,"[rushes up to stop Tweek] Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well. "
6,9,Free Hat,35201,Cartman,"People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off? "
6,9,Free Hat,35205,Cartman,"[draws near] Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! [walks off] "
6,9,Free Hat,35210,Cartman,"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek! "
6,9,Free Hat,35212,Cartman,"Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it! "
6,9,Free Hat,35220,Cartman,"Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B. "
6,9,Free Hat,35223,Cartman,"[beat] You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? [the boys reach for the left side of their bodies and rip off their clothes. Underneath they wear colorful Latin outfits and grin.] "
6,9,Free Hat,35225,Cartman,"Hit it, Tweek! [Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, there's a lots of- "
6,9,Free Hat,35227,Cartman,"...No, he has an icy heart. "
6,9,Free Hat,35230,Cartman,It's a cool island song. 
6,9,Free Hat,35232,Cartman,"Oh, do we wanna do that? "
6,9,Free Hat,35296,Cartman,Wow. 
6,9,Free Hat,35298,Cartman,AY! 
6,9,Free Hat,35327,Cartman,"Man, that new version must have sucked balls. "
6,9,Free Hat,35343,Cartman,That and youth. Those guys are old. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35355,Cartman,"[strokes the lamb and sets it aside] Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious. [grabs a basket with a bottle of lotion sitting inside and lowers it down the hole. The basket stops when it reaches Polly Prissy Pants, which sits at the bottom of the hole] Now it takes the lotion from the basket. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35357,Cartman,It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35359,Cartman,"Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35361,Cartman,It puts the lotion back in the basket! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35363,Cartman,[throws a fit] Put the lotion in the fucking basket! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35365,Cartman,"Yes, mom? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35367,Cartman,"[thinks a bit, then looks up] No, our teacher's dead. Remember? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35369,Cartman,[pause] Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35371,Cartman,[starts to throw another fit] But I wanna plaaayyy! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35380,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35388,Cartman,"Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35390,Cartman,It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35399,Cartman,"Yeah, may be. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35412,Cartman,"Right, heh. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35446,Cartman,Woohoo. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35472,Cartman,"God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35477,Cartman,Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! [the boys crack up] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35513,Cartman,"Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35515,Cartman,"[offers Tweek his plate] Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35519,Cartman,"And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35522,Cartman,"And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35525,Cartman,"Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35528,Cartman,"And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35530,Cartman,"And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35532,Cartman,Pleeeeease??? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35534,Cartman,"[removes the watch and peanuts] Alright, fine! So then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that it's been really fun. Here's a watch and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts again] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35537,Cartman,"Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35541,Cartman,"[arrives] That's fine! That's fine!! [sticks up his middle finger] Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan! [leaves, then returns, and sticks the middle finger up again] Fuck you, Tweek! [leaves, then returns] Bebe, you're still cool. [leaves again] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35580,Cartman,"[holds up the poodle] See, and this is Precious. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35582,Cartman,"[squeezes the poodle] Bark bark bark. [sets the poodle aside] Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket [puts the lotion in the basket] and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. [the basket descends] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35584,Cartman,"Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."" "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35586,Cartman,"Heheh, yeah. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35588,Cartman,"Now say it again, louder. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35590,Cartman,"Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket! "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35592,Cartman,"Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"" "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35594,Cartman,Put the lotion in the fucking basket! [pushes the rubber poodle into the hole] Oh no! Precious! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35596,Cartman,"Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"" "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35598,Cartman,"You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- [stops when he hears Timmy's wheelchair and looks around] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35600,Cartman,"We're playing ""Lambs."" "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35722,Cartman,Bebe's boobs? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35727,Cartman,"So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35740,Cartman,"What a stupid bitch! [the boys start laughing again. Butters is laughing hard, but realizes that his finger is still on Wendy's breast.] "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35776,Cartman,[orders his ticket first] One please. 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35780,Cartman,"Dude, relax. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35782,Cartman,"Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him? "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35870,Cartman,"So weak. So weak, dude. Man. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35912,Cartman,At least I'm not a stupid Jew. 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35971,Cartman,Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36019,Cartman,You bet your fat clown ass it is! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36021,Cartman,[the boys' jaws drop a bit] ...ticket stub? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36025,Cartman,"Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36029,Cartman,[drops the buckets] GODDAMMIT!!! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36032,Cartman,"You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. [Zoom in on Cartman, who starts remembering...] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36036,Cartman,"[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36040,Cartman,[bolts away] Kenny!!! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36048,Cartman,Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36051,Cartman,[muffled] What the fuck is closure?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36056,Cartman,You turned him into a teapot? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36061,Cartman,Wewewewewewe... 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36063,Cartman,"Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards. [resumes the detection] Wewewewewewe... "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36070,Cartman,...Kenny? [the boys lose their fear and rise up to look at the urn] Kenny?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36073,Cartman,What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36076,Cartman,God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36079,Cartman,"Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36082,Cartman,"Hmmm. [leaves his stool and returns with some milk, a glass, and a spoon. He scoops up some ashes and drops them into the glass. He pours the milk onto the ashes, stirs them up, and drinks the milk ] Hmm, not bad. [scoops some more ashes into the milk] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36085,Cartman,"[sits up, eyes wide open] Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. [growls a bit, turns to sleep, and farts. The door flies open and Stan and Kyle rush in] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36087,Cartman,"[sits up again] What what? [sees who it is] Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36089,Cartman,How? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36117,Cartman,"I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. [hands it to the other two boys, who put it in place] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36119,Cartman,...No. [the boys let the seat drop] Ey! Euuugh. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36124,Cartman,"[startled] Wha-uh, what?? What? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36126,Cartman,I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36128,Cartman,Do you think? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36151,Cartman,"Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36156,Cartman,"[joins the other two boys, grunting as he gets into position] Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36158,Cartman,"Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36160,Cartman,Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36162,Cartman,"You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36164,Cartman,Because Jews don't believe in heaven! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36166,Cartman,Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36168,Cartman,"AH! [stunned, he has another flashback. A heartbeat is heard] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36173,Cartman,"In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36175,Cartman,What did you say?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36177,Cartman,What did you say?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36178,Cartman,"[in the present] I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!"" [opens his eyes and looks around] Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36180,Cartman,"I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36182,Cartman,[amid his thoughts] You're a- stupid Jew. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36217,Cartman,"[resigned, comes clean] Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36220,Cartman,[knowingly] Shut up! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36222,Cartman,[knowingly] Shut up! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36225,Cartman,That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36228,Cartman,"I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36230,Cartman,Looks like I've come to the right place. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36232,Cartman,"Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that I need sucked out, please. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36234,Cartman,Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! [a woman and her boyfriend enter the clinic. The woman sobs] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36236,Cartman,"Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me! [the woman can't believe what she's hearing] I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36239,Cartman,"Eh! [becomes catatonic once more, and another flashback comes] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36241,Cartman,Kenny! Kenny! Kenny... 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36246,Cartman,"[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle... "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36249,Cartman,"You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts! [fast forward to Kenny's room. He walks to a locked box by the window while looking at the ticket stub. He unlocks it, puts the ticket in, and locks the box again.] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36251,Cartman,The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! [walks up to a couple filling out paperwork] Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God! [heads out the door] You guys! YOU GUYS!! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36261,Cartman,You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! [Stan and Kyle rise and line up on either side of Cartman] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36263,Cartman,"I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36265,Cartman,"I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic [Kyle looks down at the lumber, then looks at the pile behind him] and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box. [Kyle fishes around for a small solid piece of lumber, then finds one and aims it at Cartman's head] I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken- [thunk] AY! [is dazed for a bit, then recovers none too pleased, then glares at Kyle] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36267,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! [starts at Kyle, but Stan holds him back] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36269,Cartman,Not by giving me brain damage! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36271,Cartman,"[stares at Stan, then resigns to his former position] Alright, go ahead. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!... no. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!... "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36293,Cartman,"...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36305,Cartman,"[chuckles] No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick! [looks stunned] ...Oh Jesus Christ. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36307,Cartman,"Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! [runs off] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36320,Cartman,Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36325,Cartman,It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36337,Cartman,Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. [a car passes by and Cartman fires away at it with his staff] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36339,Cartman,"And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36341,Cartman,Jews can't be Paladins. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36366,Cartman,Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense? 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36368,Cartman,"Man, that's crap. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36382,Cartman,And so the party returns home after completing their great quest. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36385,Cartman,Prepare for battle! [switch to the car] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36391,Cartman,This sounds like a really important quest. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36394,Cartman,This... is so cool. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36404,Cartman,"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. [the boys head up the stairs and out of the house. Butters opens the door and jumps at them] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36418,Cartman,And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36421,Cartman,Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. [three older boys ride up on their bikes and stop before the group. It's the sixth graders] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36427,Cartman,You're gay! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36435,Cartman,Yeah! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36438,Cartman,The one tape must be returned! [swats the tape out of the sixth grader's hands with the staff and watches as the tape falls into Stan's hands] Run! [the boys run away from the sixth graders] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36458,Cartman,"I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36466,Cartman,"[rises and moves off] Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36486,Cartman,[waves his left hand around] Open. [nothing. He waves his left hand again] Bellog. [the door opens and Clyde appears] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36493,Cartman,"We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36495,Cartman,"Thank you, High Elf of Paragon. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36497,Cartman,Clyde's a dick. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36510,Cartman,"Kevin, god-damnit..! [Kevin looks around, then hops off his chair and leaves] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36520,Cartman,Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. [the other boys stir] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36525,Cartman,"My God, this thing must really be powerful. [the boys turn to look at the tape] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36536,Cartman,Quiet! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36538,Cartman,You're acting like a bunch of assholes! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36547,Cartman,"Yeah, stupid. [higher pitch] Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's big enough for the both of us. [a bit lower] Shut up, Kenny. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36553,Cartman,A dark wizard must be trying to stop us! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36576,Cartman,"Yes, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure! [they pass a yard on which some kids are playing] For that is the way of the-- "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36581,Cartman,[after a few moments of thought] Ha!! Fags! [the boys move on. They soon pass a Country Café] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36583,Cartman,It's Butters. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36585,Cartman,"Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. [behind the six boys, at some distance, is Butters, skulking along in the shadows] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36587,Cartman,"[""Just ignore him maybe he'll go away. ""]"
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36589,Cartman,"There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! [the sound of sixth graders is heard in the distance. The boys look around to find the direction of the sound. The sixth graders appear in the horizon behind them and ride in quickly, screaming all the while] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36596,Cartman,Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!

6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36601,Cartman,Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36612,Cartman,"We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are! [twitched] That's what ""lost"" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36620,Cartman,If that was possible. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36646,Cartman,We're screwed. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36663,Cartman,The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36670,Cartman,And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36726,Cartman,"[leans towards Craig, who pays attention] Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a... [glances back] Pakistani. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36730,Cartman,"[begins making a paper plane involuntarily] No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny? "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36732,Cartman,"[finishes the plane and aims it at Mr. Garrison] Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! [fires the plane off. It hits the board and falls away] "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36734,Cartman,"No, it was Kenny! "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36763,Cartman,Ey! 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36766,Cartman,"Aw man, this is awesome! [""JAP""] "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36768,Cartman,"[excited, runs up to the guide] I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again! "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36774,Cartman,"[over at a fourth exhibit, a man cowering over a bag of money] Look, a covetous Jew! "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36781,Cartman,Ey! 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36786,Cartman,"[strokes his chin and tries something out] I'm not fat, I have a different life choice. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36788,Cartman,"Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! [the adults chuckle] "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36836,Cartman,"I'll take three lunches today, please. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36838,Cartman,"It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. [Chef is puzzled] "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36931,Cartman,"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36933,Cartman,Nothing. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36935,Cartman,"[salutes] Yes sir! [the guard walks away] Phew. [opens the door and steps inside, laughing. A few moments later he craps and starts laughing] "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36937,Cartman,"[exits and alerts any available soldier] Hey, I was just kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! [goes to find a soldier] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,36996,Cartman,"[disoriented] Kenny. Shut up, Kenny. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37012,Cartman,"Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny! "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37026,Cartman,[cheerfully] Hey you guys! How's it goin'? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37029,Cartman,[surly] What the hell are you assholes doing here?! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37032,Cartman,"Oh, about a month. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37035,Cartman,He's gone again. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37052,Cartman,"[giggles] Ha-heheheh. [the boys look at him; he takes his headphones off and looks at them] That was Kenny laughing, not me. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37069,Cartman,Kenny! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37107,Cartman,"Thanks, asshole. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37150,Cartman,"Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass! "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37153,Cartman,Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37155,Cartman,"Oh, good. [All passengers put on their headsets.] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37161,Cartman,"Oh for the love of Christ. [switches from miffed to excited] I wanna watch, fat boy! [...and back to miffed] No, Kenny, it's not funny! "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37222,Cartman,Right now? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37225,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, watch it lady. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37248,Cartman,"Ahh, Aahhhh! [the adults back away from the bed. Soon, an orange glow appears on Cartman's belly] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37294,Cartman,"[entering refreshed] Hey, ah I feel a lot better. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37327,Cartman,God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37331,Cartman,It's still at baggage claim! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37366,Cartman,"[takes the bag from Kyle and offers it to Stan] Then you throw it away, smartass. [Stan walked into that one] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37416,Cartman,Who's this asshole? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37419,Cartman,Then how does he know our names? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37421,Cartman,Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37424,Cartman,That is so awesome!! Thank you God! [bows deeply] Oh praise God! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37427,Cartman,"[pats Stan on the back] Juvi Hall! [laughs heartily, then gloats] Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! [laughs heartily] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37521,Cartman,"[an egg-shaped chair is seen, with its back to the boys] Yes, come in, please. [the chair turns around, and Cartman appears seated on it.] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37523,Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37525,Cartman,"I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37528,Cartman,"Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then? [Stan and Butters stop in their tracks] Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37530,Cartman,"That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37532,Cartman,"Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. [Stan and Butters think a moment, then take seats before Cartman] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37534,Cartman,"[lets out a heavy sigh] God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37536,Cartman,"Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37538,Cartman,"Eighteen thousand dollars. [Stan looks angry, Butters looks to him for guidance] How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five. [Stan still looks angry, Butters follows] How about five bucks? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37548,Cartman,"Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here. [displays a few brochures and opens one] What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37550,Cartman,"Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. [displays some swatches with poop samples on them] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37552,Cartman,"Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37554,Cartman,"Now, personally, I like the baby green. [switches to a new swatch] But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37556,Cartman,"Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37558,Cartman,"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37560,Cartman,"Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37562,Cartman,"The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37564,Cartman,Your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37566,Cartman,"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. [Stan's excitement vanishes] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37569,Cartman,What? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37571,Cartman,"Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37573,Cartman,"Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations. [throws the brochure away and gets some paper from inside the desk] Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37575,Cartman,Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37577,Cartman,"[""[sighs] Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme where do you want it? ""]"
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37579,Cartman,"I am a professional, suh! [watches Stan leave] Don't worry, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37599,Cartman,"Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe! [a painter descends from the small ladder he's on] The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37601,Cartman,"¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37603,Cartman,"Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú? [looks in another part of the living room] ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we [sees a sponge on the floor and picks it up] spackle with the sponge. [dips the sponge into a poop tray and spackles the wall with it] See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37605,Cartman,Marrado. Spectacularrr. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37607,Cartman,"God, it's so hard to find good help. [runs into Butters, who has just entered the house] Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37609,Cartman,"Yearh, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37611,Cartman,"Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I? [notices another worker] ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! ¡No come la taco la trabajar! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37637,Cartman,"Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37639,Cartman,"Ooo, ah, that's a different company. [the doorbell rings] Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ¡Vamonos! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37674,Cartman,Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37676,Cartman,"Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37678,Cartman,Who the hell are you? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37680,Cartman,"[sets the box of cookies down] Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37682,Cartman,"Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want! [The Marshes leave. He joins them] Whatevuh! I'll do what I want! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37686,Cartman,You're done? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37688,Cartman,"Yeah, so how's it look? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37690,Cartman,"But I'll still be getting presents this year, right? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37692,Cartman,What?! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37694,Cartman,Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? [lifts up a sheet from the desk] 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37696,Cartman,['It was nice for Tolkien he laughed for like 20 minutes. ']
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37698,Cartman,"[lunges at Kyle Schwartz and grabs him by the left arm] God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37700,Cartman,"Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37702,Cartman,[thinks a minute] Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37704,Cartman,Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37706,Cartman,Jesus Christ! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37711,Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and Kyle, who are holding candy canes] Hi guys! [""Christmas Tree!"" Cartman is feeling quite cheerful. He hugs both Stan and Kyle] A very Merry Christmas to you. God bless us, everyone! [he lets go] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37713,Cartman,I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37717,Cartman,"Oh my God, that's it! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37719,Cartman,"Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunates! Follow me! [leaves in high spirits, then returns] You guys, come on! Right now! [Stan and Kyle shrug, then follow Cartman.] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37728,Cartman,"[breathlessly, comes out with the box and sets it down near the driveway] ...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore. [rushes back inside] And here! Here's some Christmas cookies! [comes out with the box of cookies and sets it down] And some holly and mistletoe! [rushes in to get it, then comes out with the box, setting it next to the box of toys] Oh, this'll be the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37730,Cartman,"They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37734,Cartman,"[annoyed, softly] Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo. [in normal voice] Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37737,Cartman,The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37739,Cartman,Really? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37744,Cartman,Wow! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37748,Cartman,[grabs the box of holly and mistletoe and heads for the train] Get the rest of the stuff you guys! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37751,Cartman,"You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunates! [moves on] Now come on! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37757,Cartman,"Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37768,Cartman,"Wow, is that where Santa lives? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37782,Cartman,"Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37784,Cartman,"[brushes it off] Oh, that's so lame of them. [Stan looks at him] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37786,Cartman,"[with hands behind his back] Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37788,Cartman,That's what I thought. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37792,Cartman,Hooray! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37813,Cartman,No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37821,Cartman,Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37823,Cartman,[blubbering] Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37825,Cartman,"It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37827,Cartman,"Oh, Christ. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37837,Cartman,"Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37841,Cartman,"Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet- "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37844,Cartman,"Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37846,Cartman,I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles- 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37848,Cartman,"[looks at Kyle, then lowers his eyelids a bit] I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37850,Cartman,"[draws close to Kyle] Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37852,Cartman,"[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh... "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37876,Cartman,Jesus! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37889,Cartman,"This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole! [Jesus looks over, Cartman notices] I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37902,Cartman,"This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37937,Cartman,"Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me- "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37939,Cartman,"Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37972,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37974,Cartman,"Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! [kicks the toy away. The camera zooms out enough for a fourth person to walk into the shot] "
7,1,Cancelled,37986,Cartman,What? 
7,1,Cancelled,37990,Cartman,"Yeah! Go home, you little dildo! "
7,1,Cancelled,37992,Cartman,"Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead! [the boys laugh, Kyle picks up Ike and swings him towards Cartman. Ike smacks Cartman in the face and Cartman falls on his back] Ow! "
7,1,Cancelled,37998,Cartman,[gets up and yawns] 
7,1,Cancelled,38000,Cartman,That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. 
7,1,Cancelled,38002,Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed… [the dream sequence begins] in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room [his window flies open and a bright beam blinds him as he rises to see what it is]. Then slowly my bedroom door began to open [a glow appears around the door as an alien peeks inside] and the next thing I remember I was being drugged through a hallway. [This hallway has specimens on either side of it. ""Weeaak!""] Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me. [four aliens hover over him and lower his pajama pants as a robot arm nearby gets to work on his ass] And they had big heads and big black eyes… "
7,1,Cancelled,38005,Cartman,What? 
7,1,Cancelled,38007,Cartman,"No, it was just a dream, [crosses his arms] my mom said so. "
7,1,Cancelled,38010,Cartman,What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about? 
7,1,Cancelled,38012,Cartman,"Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me. "
7,1,Cancelled,38014,Cartman,No I don't remember that! 
7,1,Cancelled,38016,Cartman,"No, because the aliens erased my memory! "
7,1,Cancelled,38031,Cartman,"Aw dude, I hate repeats! "
7,1,Cancelled,38046,Cartman,"[whips an angry look at him] SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! [pulls his head back and rests it on his left hand] "
7,1,Cancelled,38048,Cartman,What? 
7,1,Cancelled,38050,Cartman,"[displeased] Haha, very funny. "
7,1,Cancelled,38053,Cartman,"Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing? "
7,1,Cancelled,38056,Cartman,"Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Ooh. Oww... "
7,1,Cancelled,38058,Cartman,"Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooh-ah. Uuuuu, aaaaah. "
7,1,Cancelled,38061,Cartman,"[with a dreamy, relieved look] Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome. [smiles] "
7,1,Cancelled,38064,Cartman,"[the probe collapses and sinks back into his ass] Aaaaaa, aaaaaah! Ooagh! "
7,1,Cancelled,38066,Cartman,"You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!! "
7,1,Cancelled,38075,Cartman,"[crosses his arms] Ohhh no, no no no no! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. [grins] "
7,1,Cancelled,38077,Cartman,Nope! It has to be Kyle! 
7,1,Cancelled,38081,Cartman,"[lowers his pants and moons Kyle] Come, Kyle. Do hurry. [Kyle moves tentatively toward Cartman and bares his left arm] Go ahead, it won't bite. [Kyle raises his arm and move in. Cartman farts and Kyle angrily lowers his arm. Cartman and Kenny laugh] "
7,1,Cancelled,38083,Cartman,[laughing] I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] 
7,1,Cancelled,38085,Cartman,[laughing] Okay. Okay okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] 
7,1,Cancelled,38088,Cartman,"[laughing] Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm, looking at the other guys.] Gahaaa! Derrr! "
7,1,Cancelled,38090,Cartman,"Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Oh yes it is! [swats the odor towards Kyle.] "
7,1,Cancelled,38093,Cartman,"Okay, okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohh, double psych! "
7,1,Cancelled,38096,Cartman,"All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle. "
7,1,Cancelled,38098,Cartman,"No, go ahead. I'm dry. "
7,1,Cancelled,38101,Cartman,But it was one of the best times I've ever had. 
7,1,Cancelled,38103,Cartman,"Okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohhh! God-dammit! [Cartman, Kenny, and Chef laugh] "
7,1,Cancelled,38105,Cartman,"This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven. "
7,1,Cancelled,38111,Cartman,"Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys. "
7,1,Cancelled,38118,Cartman,[steps forward and points to Jeff] It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities! 
7,1,Cancelled,38130,Cartman,"What are you doing, man?! [Chef drives towards the barricade and goes up a wooden ramp, into the air.] "
7,1,Cancelled,38137,Cartman,When do we get to eat. I'm hungry. 
7,1,Cancelled,38148,Cartman,"Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass! [panics] Oh God, help me, you guys! "
7,1,Cancelled,38150,Cartman,"[looks down] ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you, Lord. "
7,1,Cancelled,38156,Cartman,This is like my fifth time. [the room brightens and two doors open at the other end of the room. The boys turn and face it] 
7,1,Cancelled,38164,Cartman,"Aw God, that movie pissed me off. "
7,1,Cancelled,38169,Cartman,Santa! 
7,1,Cancelled,38173,Cartman,"[impressed] Oooo, very nice. "
7,1,Cancelled,38196,Cartman,"How about a taco, that craps ice cream? [the alien transforms into the taco. A wad of ice cream falls out of him] Guys? "
7,1,Cancelled,38213,Cartman,Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! [the boys just look at each other] 
7,1,Cancelled,38274,Cartman,"[miffed at the link, rests his head on his left hand] Tell us about it. "
7,1,Cancelled,38310,Cartman,No. 
7,1,Cancelled,38316,Cartman,There's even World War Three to look forward to. 
7,1,Cancelled,38323,Cartman,[yawns] Uuugh. 
7,1,Cancelled,38325,Cartman,That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long. 
7,1,Cancelled,38332,Cartman,"What is it, Chef? "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38353,Cartman,We didn't go to your comedy show. 
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38370,Cartman,"Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38378,Cartman,"[jumps up and catches up to them] Hey, wait a minute! [Timmy and Jimmy stop] You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it! "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38380,Cartman,Can too! 
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38382,Cartman,Oh God-damnit!! 
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38384,Cartman,But they say I can't be in their club!! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38628,Cartman,[laughing] Put more clay on the balls. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38632,Cartman,"[retorts] What a crime. [the three others chuckle, then laugh out loud] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38638,Cartman,You can't do that! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38640,Cartman,You're an art teacher! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38646,Cartman,We can't let her get away with this! [voicing dropping to almost a whisper] I think tonight we need to do something drastic. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38648,Cartman,"Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38651,Cartman,Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38653,Cartman,"[sensing Kyle's reluctance] What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? [begins strutting like a chicken and making chicken noises. Kyle kicks Cartman in the balls in anger] Ugh! [drops to his knees, then gets one leg up] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38656,Cartman,"[in pain] Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38659,Cartman,Should be fine. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38661,Cartman,"Okay. [reaches behind the other boys and grabs something] Here we go, pack of chewing gum. [tosses it into the first cart. They approach the cash register] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38663,Cartman,Yep. All set. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38665,Cartman,"Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38669,Cartman,"Heh yeah, that that's right. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38672,Cartman,No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38676,Cartman,"It's the right address-wait! Look there! [the teacher prepares the dining-room table] There's Mrs. Streibel! This is the place. [loosens the drawstring on his back and lets the sides fall away. In the dining room, a boy and girl arrive and sit at table] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38678,Cartman,So? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38682,Cartman,"Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. [takes out a roll and advances a bit] Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! [unleashes the first roll] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38685,Cartman,"Come on, let's go! [he and Kenny cross the road and drop down to a ditch on the other side. Stan follows] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38690,Cartman,"Aw man, that was sooo awesome! [smiles] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38692,Cartman,Who cares?? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38694,Cartman,"Me?? [takes a couple steps forward] There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. [Kyle blanches] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38706,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38708,Cartman,"Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. [the bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with some books.] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38710,Cartman,[snaps his fingers] Damn! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38714,Cartman,"Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38716,Cartman,"Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38719,Cartman,"Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it?? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38721,Cartman,"[exasperated] Oh, for Christ's sake! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38723,Cartman,"Thank you, Stan. [the doorknow begins to turn] Sh sh, here they come, here they come. [the door opens and Mr. Mackey appears] ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38727,Cartman,"Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38729,Cartman,"They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38731,Cartman,"Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38754,Cartman,"[in rave tones] Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38756,Cartman,No need. I have one for you right here. [presents a glass of water to him] 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38758,Cartman,Is there anything else I can get for you? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38760,Cartman,"You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. [closes the door] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38782,Cartman,"Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second? [Stan waves bye to Clyde, Craig, and Kevin, and they leave. He and Kenny approach Cartman talks in hushed tones] I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38784,Cartman,"Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38786,Cartman,"[""Kyle can't take the heat he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did. ""]"
7,3,Toilet Paper,38789,Cartman,"[a few seconds later] Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38791,Cartman,We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38794,Cartman,Why not? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38796,Cartman,"He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. [walks off] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38811,Cartman,"I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38813,Cartman,I just thought we should find a private place to... talk. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38815,Cartman,"Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat? [Kyle walks over and helps Cartman load the block and chain onto the boat. Kyle then hops in. Cartman retrieves a bat, loads it onto the boat, and hops in. The boat begins to float away from the shore.] Okay, let's go. [starts to row. The boat heads for the middle of the pond, and eerie music plays] So how are things, Kyle? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38817,Cartman,And you feel like you have to confess. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38819,Cartman,"I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. [whacks him again] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38821,Cartman,"Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. [whacks him twice more] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38823,Cartman,"Won't be long, Kyle. [whacks him three more times.] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38847,Cartman,I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38849,Cartman,They did? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38853,Cartman,But can I still kill Kyyyle? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38858,Cartman,"Uh, can we see them-him-her? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38868,Cartman,What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38873,Cartman,"[rushes up and intervenes] Wiffle ball, anyone? [glares at Kyle] Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38877,Cartman,"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38879,Cartman,What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38881,Cartman,"Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38883,Cartman,"So... so then, how can you feel bad? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38885,Cartman,...But he's not gonna get in trouble. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38888,Cartman,"What?? Eh... [tries to be upbeat] hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38890,Cartman,"[looks at the other boys in disbelief] For oth-er... [winces] Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38892,Cartman,"Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38908,Cartman,"Come on, you guys! Hurry! [steps forward and looks back to his friends] Guys, hurry! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38910,Cartman,It's over this way! Come on! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38912,Cartman,"So how are things, guys? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38914,Cartman,I'm afraid I can't let that happen. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38916,Cartman,Can't I? [pulls out the Wiffle ball bat and starts whacking the other three. They just look at each other.] 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38929,Cartman,[steps forward from the back of the room] Hi guys. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38931,Cartman,"I told them everything, you guys. It's over. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38933,Cartman,My consciences just caught up with me. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38948,Cartman,"I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38950,Cartman,"I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38952,Cartman,Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you- 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38954,Cartman,Hm. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38969,Cartman,"[searching his notebook] Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that? "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38984,Cartman,[reading Kenny's sign] Bush is a Naizi 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38993,Cartman,"...Eh the... Foggy who? [seconds later, both sides rush each other and attack] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39001,Cartman,"[beginning to slack off] Ugh. Ughuh. [tries to resume studying, but his eyes grow heavy. He panics] I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! [yawns loudly and promptly sleeps on his book] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39003,Cartman,But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39005,Cartman,Maaaa. M-maaaa. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39007,Cartman,"Maaaa. Mah mah mh. [reluctantly returns to reading. He begins to fidget, then reads more, then fidgets again, turns the page, fidgets once more, then just thinks] Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days? [repeats the question, his voice fading at each repetition] In those days? In those days? In those days? "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39009,Cartman,I'm trying to have a flashback. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39011,Cartman,"You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39013,Cartman,"No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second. [thinks] Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then? [repeats the last two words, his voice fading at each repetition] Back then? Back then? Back then? [nothing happens. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at him] Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me. [his voice begins to fade and he begins moving his hands around like a pantomime. The camera closes in] With me. With... anything to do with me. With me. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39017,Cartman,"[throws a fit] Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39033,Cartman,That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. [tests the tautness of the string] 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39035,Cartman,"All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39037,Cartman,"Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Kenny looks at them. They clear the doorway. Kyle stands on one side, Stan and Kenny on the other. Cartman backs up, clears his throat, then begins to walk with purpose] Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. [trips the string. The rock immediately falls on his head, knocking him out. He moans a few times.] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39039,Cartman,Benjamin Franklin? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39041,Cartman,"[touches Kyle, then in a weak raspy voice] Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39061,Cartman,"Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39063,Cartman,Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39065,Cartman,"I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39067,Cartman,Or a really sweet one. [a bell is heard] 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39069,Cartman,"Whoa, here it goes! [triggers the sledgehammer as he falls. Both he and the TiVo land in the tub, and the house shorts out. Cartman is electrocuted as he lands in the water. The boys spend a few seconds in the darkness looking at Cartman, wondering if he'll come to. Kenny turns and walks away slowly] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39073,Cartman,"Ohhh awesome!!! [a horse-drawn carriage approaches, driven by a teenage boy.] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39075,Cartman,Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39077,Cartman,Oho yes! I did it I did it! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39079,Cartman,"Oho kick fucking ass, dude! [approaches the carriage and climbs up to sit alongside the driver] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39081,Cartman,"No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39083,Cartman,"Well you know, it's a... [points at something] H-ho, awesome! [they've entered the town and Cartman begins to sing.]  Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776. With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks. What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously. Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.   "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39095,Cartman,Super neato! [both driver and Cartman disboard and walk towards the door] 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39097,Cartman,"But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39099,Cartman,"Oh, okay.I guess I understand. [the driver walks off. Cartman notices some firewood and picks up a log of it, then follows the driver while singing to himself]  I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...[he quickly assaults the driver and beats him with the log, then drags the body away and returns to the Jefferson residence, knocking on the door] I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...   "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39101,Cartman,"And I am the official messenger boy, I am. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39103,Cartman,"[beholding it] Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39105,Cartman,"It's a bitch, ain't it? "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39137,Cartman,Wow. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39172,Cartman,"[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39196,Cartman,"Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39205,Cartman,"Wow, I get it now! I get it! [senses his flashback coming to an end] Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39207,Cartman,Wow! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39209,Cartman,"[appears on stage in his hospital gown, his hair disheveled] Everyone, stop! Please! [everyone stops and looks at him] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39211,Cartman,"If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39214,Cartman,"I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. [a shot of the crowd]  "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39215,Cartman,"You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too."" "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39224,Cartman,"The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39249,Cartman,[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39252,Cartman,"[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39256,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39258,Cartman,"Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39260,Cartman,"[fits the dress under his hand] There we go, Saright? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39262,Cartman,That's a very pretty dress. [the Latino Endowment Council is shown again] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39264,Cartman,"Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39266,Cartman,"Nono, Jeh- "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39268,Cartman,Jeh- 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39270,Cartman,Jeh- 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39272,Cartman,Jennifer Lopez. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39275,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39277,Cartman,"And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39279,Cartman,Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39281,Cartman,"Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39283,Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39285,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39287,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39289,Cartman,Is nice? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39292,Cartman,"Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39297,Cartman,"Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39303,Cartman,I agree. Those places are stupid. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39306,Cartman,"Hey, I'm on your guys' side. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39312,Cartman,Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39315,Cartman,"All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39331,Cartman,"Yeah, I wanna leave. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39333,Cartman,What? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39344,Cartman,"Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. [hands the phone to ""her""] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39346,Cartman,What do they want? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39348,Cartman,S'awright? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39350,Cartman,What? What? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39352,Cartman,"[puts the phone to his ear] Hello, are you still there? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39354,Cartman,You want to sign Ms. Lopez? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39356,Cartman,"Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!! [hangs up and grins] We're gonna be rich! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39358,Cartman,"Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! [runs off] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39360,Cartman,There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39362,Cartman,"[scoots back to his bedside lamp and turns it off, then settles under the covers] Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. [rubs off her open eyes and paints some closed lids on his hand.] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39364,Cartman,"Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow... [begins to dream of taunting Kyle] Tomorrow... "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39366,Cartman," ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!"" [in class, sitting next to each other] ""You were wrong, Kyle!"" [in the cafeteria, as Kyle walks by with his lunch] ""Nananananaaana!"" [on the bus ride home] ""Hahahahahaaaha!"" [images of Kyle come forth, crying] ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!"" [in his sleep] Awesommme. Yeeessss. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39398,Cartman,[runs up] Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! [Slience.] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39400,Cartman,"[approaches him] Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39402,Cartman,"Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39405,Cartman,"[a slight gloat arises] Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich. [nods to his hand] And famous. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39410,Cartman,Jennifer Lopez? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39425,Cartman,Not me! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39431,Cartman,I'm sure it was just a mistake. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39433,Cartman,Shut your God-damned mouth! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39435,Cartman,Nobody! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39438,Cartman,Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39440,Cartman,I will! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39447,Cartman,Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39451,Cartman,"Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39462,Cartman,What the hell are you doing? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39464,Cartman,"Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39466,Cartman,Sleep! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39468,Cartman,"[slowly, whiney] Sleep! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39470,Cartman,Moooommm! [Cartman's mother enters the room] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39472,Cartman,Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39474,Cartman,[real tired] He-yesss. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39476,Cartman,[hides his left hand] She's not here right now. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39486,Cartman,NO! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39488,Cartman,I'm not going out in his car. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39490,Cartman,I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework. [Ben stars picking his nose] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39492,Cartman,"I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39506,Cartman,[reacts] NO! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39508,Cartman,"Aw, God dammit! [looks away in disgust once more. Ben begins to give French kisses to ""Jennifer Lopez"" and the hand responds] Aww- awww, dude! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39517,Cartman,"OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT! [opens his door, hops out, and walks away] WE'RE LEAVING NOW!! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39531,Cartman,Aww crap. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39533,Cartman,OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39539,Cartman,"I told you this would happen. [Kyle, Stan and Kenny show up.] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39543,Cartman,"Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39547,Cartman,"EHAGH! [next to him is Ben Affleck, naked and relaxed] Moooooommmm! [Ben wakes up] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39549,Cartman,Ben Affleck is naked in my bed! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39553,Cartman,You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39555,Cartman,What? Oh- AWWW! [wipes his hand off on his pajamas] Ben Affleck's spooge!! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39557,Cartman,What news? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39560,Cartman,S'aright. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39563,Cartman,"Oh, balls! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39566,Cartman,"[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39568,Cartman,"I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39570,Cartman,Stop doing what? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39572,Cartman,"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and ""Jennifer Lopez"" emerges coughing] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39579,Cartman,Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39587,Cartman,"Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39589,Cartman,"Quiet, Ms. Lopez. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39591,Cartman,"Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39622,Cartman,"I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39624,Cartman,[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39636,Cartman,"Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39641,Cartman,Stupid assholes! [turns and follows] How come nobody has a crime to solve? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39649,Cartman,My God... 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39655,Cartman,"What have you got, Marsh? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39657,Cartman,"[puts a hand on Kyle, looks away and closes his eyes] Jesus, we're too late. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39665,Cartman,"Slowly the rage built inside his mind. [Mr. Farnickle is shown in bed, getting angry. Dramatic lighting enhances the mood] ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39667,Cartman,"Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. [the scenario shows Mr. Farnickle walking up behind his wife as she dusts the TV and whacking her three times, killing her and fracturing her skull] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39670,Cartman,"The torso he would dump into the lake. [Mr. Farnickle tosses his wife's torso over the side of his boat, then watches as the torso heads for the lake bottom] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39672,Cartman,"And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39674,Cartman,"Looks like the game is over, old man! [the surprised couple looks at them] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39683,Cartman,"Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39689,Cartman,"[waving his mom off] Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all. [Liane goes upstairs. Cartman looks up] And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39697,Cartman,"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39699,Cartman,No sign of forced entry. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39703,Cartman,We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39710,Cartman,"Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39718,Cartman,"Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39723,Cartman,Right. I think I know exactly where to start. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39725,Cartman,"[thinks hard of how to start the interrogation] Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39727,Cartman,"Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! [behind him, Stan and Kyle watch from a makeshift booth] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39730,Cartman,"You're going down, Butters! You hear me?! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39732,Cartman,You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39735,Cartman,Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. [holds out a cup for Butters to take] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39737,Cartman,You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39739,Cartman,Stop playing games! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39741,Cartman,"That does it! Wait right here! [goes behind the booth and laughs] Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39743,Cartman,I don't know. I was hoping you guys did. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39745,Cartman,Really? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39747,Cartman,"Oh okay. [returns to the table] Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39749,Cartman,Follow me to the bathroom. [goes upstairs] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39752,Cartman,"Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39754,Cartman,"Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it! [Butters grabs the door handle and shuts the door. Cartman waits for a few second before doing anything] Well, Butters?! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39756,Cartman,Well pull harder! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39758,Cartman,Try doin' it faster. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39760,Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39762,Cartman,The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39765,Cartman,Let's go! [They leave. Butters remains in the bathroom] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39771,Cartman,[in hushed tones] Kyle! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39774,Cartman,"[repeats the gestures] I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39784,Cartman,"Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. [hops down from the porch and walks away] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39786,Cartman,Why not? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39795,Cartman,"Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39798,Cartman,Yeah! This was our hot lead! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39802,Cartman,"Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39818,Cartman,"All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo! [moves out from behind the couch, shooting slowly but walking normally] Wwwaaahhh! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39827,Cartman,We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39835,Cartman,Kewl! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39862,Cartman,Uh bonus? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39876,Cartman,Me neither. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39882,Cartman,[intervening] Hey! Broflovski's a good cop! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39885,Cartman,Awwwwrrr-auugh. [hangs up his coat and holster on the coat tree in the living room] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39887,Cartman,We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39889,Cartman,"[turns and snaps at her] Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! [realizes what he's doing, then turns away] Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39891,Cartman,[straightens up and smiles] Okay. [turns and walks off to bed. He passes by the bathroom. Butters is still in there] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39893,Cartman,[stops] Butters? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39895,Cartman,Are you still trying to give a semen sample? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39897,Cartman,"Well, keep tryin', Butters. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39903,Cartman,[thinks] A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39909,Cartman,Uh oh... 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39939,Cartman,Bang bang bang... [the boys move behind a chair. The men continue firing. The boys move back into view] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39942,Cartman,"[looks at Kenny] Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" [outside, police cars of all types pull up to the club. Dawson quickly jumps out of his car. An explosion appears in two windows of the club, and Dawson ducks a little] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39975,Cartman,"[walks up with some clothes] Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five. [Kenny hands him a card] On your American Express. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39977,Cartman,You did? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39980,Cartman,Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five? 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,39983,Cartman,"Man, Indians have it good, huh? "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,39986,Cartman,"[eagerly] All right, let's go! [moves forward] "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,39988,Cartman,"I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40037,Cartman,"Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. [Kyle remains baffled, even as he looks at Cartman] "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40065,Cartman,"Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40074,Cartman,That's right! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40078,Cartman,"[rises and moves to the sidewalk] Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go! [trots off excitedly. The other boys just watch him leave. Cartman returns a few seconds later] No? We can't give Kyle AIDS? "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40087,Cartman,"Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40155,Cartman,"Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40161,Cartman,You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! [follows his friends them out. The adults just watch] 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40269,Cartman,What? Tell us? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40271,Cartman,"Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40276,Cartman,[begins to laugh at him] What a dork! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40278,Cartman,"Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! [laughs heartily] "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40281,Cartman,"Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. [Stan inspects Kyle's jacket] "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40283,Cartman,"We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40323,Cartman,"That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40334,Cartman,"[moves in front of Kyle] Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40336,Cartman,Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40344,Cartman,"GOD I HATE CRAIG!! [Stan and Kenny turn to leave] That son of a... djah!! [leaves. Kyle turns to leave, but has second thoughts.] "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40357,Cartman,You're straight like a freeway! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40359,Cartman,"You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40361,Cartman,...So? I'm half bisexual! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40363,Cartman,"I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40402,Cartman,"Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40404,Cartman,Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that- 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40406,Cartman,"Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? [pulls Stan and Kenny away from Kyle] Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40408,Cartman,"We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40410,Cartman,"Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40412,Cartman,"You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40418,Cartman,He's not our friend. [Stan's jaw drops a bit. Cartman looks at Stan and walks away. Kenny follows] 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40478,Cartman,"Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40527,Cartman,"[steps forward] That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40623,Cartman,"Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! [turns and walks away. Kenny just looks at him and walks off. Kyle looks away, then back at the boys, then walks away in the opposite direction. He stops, thinks for a while, then turns around and hurries to them] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40626,Cartman,God dammit! [hangs his head and lets the mic stand fall into his left hand. All stop playing and the side door opens] 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40630,Cartman,[cackling] Heheheheheh heheheheheh. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40635,Cartman,"[stops] Inspiration. Wait a minute, [turns right and walks away from them] that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see? "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40637,Cartman,[turns around] Our band should play Christian rock! [beams with pride] 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40639,Cartman,"[races back to the band] Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40641,Cartman,"[protests, takes a step towards Kyle] It worked for Creed! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40643,Cartman,"[steps towards Stan] You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40645,Cartman,Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40647,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! [runs out as fast as his fat little body will let him, and pants] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40650,Cartman,Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! [runs up to a house and pounds on the front door. The door opens up and it's Butters who answers] 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40652,Cartman,"Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! [dashes off] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40655,Cartman,No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle! [pounds on the door and Tolkien answers] Tolkien! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! [turns around and dashes off] 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40657,Cartman,"[spins around] Your family's black, Tolkien! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! [runs off. Tolkien gets annoyed and shuts the door] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40660,Cartman,"Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. [makes changes to the sheet music on the piano's sheet music holder] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40662,Cartman,"I told you, Tolkien. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40664,Cartman,"Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40666,Cartman,We are going to start... a Christian rock band. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40669,Cartman,"Wait! [Tolkien stops, Cartman rushes over] Walk out that door, Tolkien, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- [points to Butters] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40671,Cartman,"Still want to leave, Tolkien? [Tolkien thinks a bit, then resumes his place] Thank you. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40707,Cartman,"All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them. [some sheet music is shown. Cartman has already crossed out the original author's name] See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with [writes next to ""baby""] Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat. [Butters doesn't understand, but starts drumming. It's rather good] Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Tolkien, give me a smooth bass line. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40709,Cartman,"[Sighs, has his left fist on his forehead, eyes shut] Tolkien, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40711,Cartman,"Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! [Tolkien begins to play a bass line, then is surprised that he can actually do it, then realizes that Cartman is right] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40713,Cartman,"  All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. [begins to sing] I need you in my life, Jesus. I can't live without you, Jesus And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.   "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40732,Cartman,"Almost there, you guys. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40735,Cartman,"Because, Tolkien, we have to take pictures for our album cover. [sets up his camera on a tripod] The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40738,Cartman,"[when Tolkien seems out of earshot] I'm going to kill you one day, Tolkien. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40740,Cartman,"Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. [begins to focus the shot. Butters and Tolkien stand together] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40742,Cartman,"No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! [Butters and Cartman move apart. Tolkien moves off to a boulder a little farther away, Butters moves a bit closer to the camera] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40744,Cartman,"No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40746,Cartman,"Tolkien, look away to the right. [Tolkien looks off to the right] More. [Tolkien turns his head to the right] More! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40748,Cartman,"So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! [starts the timer, then steps into the shot] Our first album cover. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40750,Cartman," Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go. My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door. I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.   "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40766,Cartman,[walks up] Oh hey guys. How's it going? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40768,Cartman,"[brushes off Kyle's comment] I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, [brings out the CD] Faith + 1, is about to go platinum. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40770,Cartman,"That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! [tugs at one of the lobes on Kyle's hat] Hahahaha ha ha! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40772,Cartman,"It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40775,Cartman,"I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! [walks off] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40782,Cartman,"Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually.. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40784,Cartman,"[takes the woman's body and puts it in the treasurer's box] I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40786,Cartman,"Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40791,Cartman,"[listening backstage, moves away a big] Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! [a group of men walk by] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40793,Cartman,Who are you? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40796,Cartman,"Yeah, you guys are real hardcore. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40801,Cartman,"Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40804,Cartman,"[edges over to a storage room with an open door] Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better. [enters. The members of Sanctified follow him in] Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... [quickly runs out and locks the band in, then props a chair up against the doorknob so the band can't get out] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40811,Cartman," You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song. I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me [the fans sway back and forth] I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby! You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right? What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby! Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh! I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!   "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40823,Cartman,Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40826,Cartman,"Yes, we sure do. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40828,Cartman,"[turns the tables] Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ?? "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40830,Cartman,"Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this?? "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40832,Cartman,"I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40837,Cartman,Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40839,Cartman,"Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40842,Cartman," The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned! The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own! You're one time, two times, three times my Savior... Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...   "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40865,Cartman,Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40867,Cartman,Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40869,Cartman,"We're Faith Plus One, Tolkien, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole. [addresses the milling crowd] There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive and join Cartman onstage] Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40871,Cartman,"[deferring] Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on. [grabs the mic and addresses the crowd] Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the crowd cheers wildly] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40873,Cartman,"Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. [Kyle is awfully pissed. A technician lowers a lever and stage lights bathe the boys] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40876,Cartman,"Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. [basks in the moment] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40878,Cartman,[takes the album] Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40882,Cartman,You mean to tell me I can never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40884,Cartman,"GOD DAMMIT!! [throws his plaque onto the ground, where it shatters. The myrrh album falls away and the crowd is stunned] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40886,Cartman,Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40888,Cartman,"OH, FUCK JESUS!! [deep gasp from the crowd. A woman screams loudly in disbelief] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40891,Cartman,"[pounces onto him] Who fuckin' cares, Tolkien?! I can never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! [The crowd screams in disbelief and scatters about] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40894,Cartman,"Ah, fuck you, Tolkien! You black asshole! "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40901,Cartman,"[yawns] Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40903,Cartman,"Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40975,Cartman,"[providing his own play-by-play] With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again [the ball bounces off Cartman's girth], proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey! "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40977,Cartman,I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40986,Cartman,Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40991,Cartman,[slowly] Calm down! We cannot understand you! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40994,Cartman, Old people! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40996,Cartman,"Oh God, they're coming! [the other boys mutter other things] "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41009,Cartman,They're not gonna stop until we're all dead! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41033,Cartman,"Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong? "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41038,Cartman,"My God, he's right. [the boys climb in, strap themselves in, and Cartman offers a quick prayer] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death. [Marvin starts up the car and groans a bit] Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys. [a few moments later] Except for you, Kyle. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41044,Cartman,I believe that's us... thank God. [Marvin pulls over to the side and stops. Barbrady stops as well and approaches the driver side.] 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41065,Cartman,More old people! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41073,Cartman,Old people gone mad! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41143,Cartman,So our only solution is to cut off their life force. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41145,Cartman,No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply. [runs his finger along the map to its destination] Here. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41147,Cartman,"Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41149,Cartman,Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41152,Cartman,"I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41153,Cartman,"We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. [they appear from the sides of buildings dressed in black and then gather in front of one of them] At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town. [they head for a train at the South Park Train Station and climb into a caboose. Kenny pulls on the horn] Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office[the elderly guards sleep standing up and fail to take notice of any sound] and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41154,Cartman,"Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41156,Cartman,Yeah! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41159,Cartman,Aw yeah! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41162,Cartman,"Well, right, or we could always do that. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41196,Cartman,Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41199,Cartman,Who's joking? [a door opens and closes offscreen] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41201,Cartman,You have AIDS? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41203,Cartman,[stands up] Wow! Casa Bonita?! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41206,Cartman,"Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and [holds out his hand wide] all kinds of stuff! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41208,Cartman,"This Saturday! Awesome! [begins to sing to ""La Cucaracha""] Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere. [begins to snap his fingers] Casa Bonita! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41210,Cartman,You... your Mom said you could take three friends. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41212,Cartman,"Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41214,Cartman,Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41216,Cartman,I have never been a dick to you. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41218,Cartman,"Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41220,Cartman,"[Cartman thinks back as well] Okay, except maybe for that one time. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41222,Cartman,"Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place [Kyle turns around] in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! [holds his hands together in a sign of pleading] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41224,Cartman,"[turns irate and flips him off] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day! [shoves the middle finger close to Kyle's face] Kiss my balls, asshole!!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, closes, and opens again. Cartman returns and apologizes] Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41226,Cartman,"[turns irate and flips him off again] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, then closes] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41228,Cartman,"Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys! [waves them on. Next scene is him getting a large platter of food] Oh, awesome!! [next scene is him waving his friends to a cave] Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave! [next scene is him by a waterfall] Wow, cliff divers! [a cliff diver takes a dive from the top of the waterfall. Next scene is Cartman on his third dish] More sopapillas, please! [next scene has him dancing in front of a low stage, on which a mariachi quartet plays its songs. An image of Kyle floats through his dream] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41230,Cartman,"[with more foods on his plates, the dream dissolves. He's pulled up and away] No! Noooo! [he's pulled out of Casa Bonita and floats away] Casa Bonita! Noooo! [startled out of his dream] AAAAH!! [catches his breath] Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41232,Cartman,[looking quite presentable] Hi Kyle. [smiles] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41234,Cartman,What isn't it? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41236,Cartman,...I don't understand the difference. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41239,Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up! [Annie and Red walk by at the far end of the hall. Jimmy stops] Dude, uh I need your help on something. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41241,Cartman,"Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41243,Cartman,"Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41245,Cartman,Like what? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41247,Cartman,Who's there? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41249,Cartman,"Take that, Jimmy! [strikes him again, and Jimmy falls away] And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! [Kyle stops by and looks. Cartman glances at him] Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?! [looks at Kyle] Oh, Kyle. Hey. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41251,Cartman,"Uh... [turns and runs towards Kyle] He-hey Kyle! Knock knock. [follows him around the corner] Knock knock, Kyle! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41258,Cartman,Hey Kyle. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41260,Cartman,Well what? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41262,Cartman,"I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41264,Cartman,"So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41266,Cartman,"I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. [turns and walks away] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41268,Cartman,"I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41270,Cartman,Good. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41272,Cartman,"Sweet, whatever. [walks on, then mouths to himself] Bingo! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41275,Cartman,"[leads him to a telescope, then turns] Butters, can you keep a secret? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41277,Cartman,"For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41279,Cartman,"A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41281,Cartman,"Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. [backs up and looks through the eyepiece] Do you see anything? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41283,Cartman,Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41285,Cartman,"Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? [Butters looks through again and Cartman holds up the wad, moving it closer to the objective lens.] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41287,Cartman,Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41289,Cartman,"I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations. [heads for his desk and pulls out a calculator] 10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41291,Cartman,"According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41293,Cartman,"No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41295,Cartman,"Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! [heads out the door] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41299,Cartman,Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! [opens the shelter's lid] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41301,Cartman,"[reaches the shelter floor] All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41303,Cartman,No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41305,Cartman,"[looks away] I'm not sure of anything anymore. [turns and climbs up the ladder. He makes it out and looks down] Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41307,Cartman,"Well, you know, with your wiener. [Butters just stares back] Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. [leaves and closes the lid, then locks it] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41313,Cartman,"[bearing a gift] Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41315,Cartman,Hope you have a good one. See you later. [turns around and walks toward the street] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41317,Cartman,Yes? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41319,Cartman,[enters the house] Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41321,Cartman,"Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41324,Cartman,"[gets excited] Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41331,Cartman,"[lowers his head and walks towards the front door] Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. [brightens up] Well, let's get going, shall we? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41334,Cartman,"[a little stunned] Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters... "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41338,Cartman,Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the... [catches himself and waits for a reaction. None comes] In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41342,Cartman,"[left alone] Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41347,Cartman,"[suddenly looks in, looking terribly roughed up] Butters! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41349,Cartman,"Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41351,Cartman,[faking fatigue] The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time... 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41353,Cartman,"There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. [coughs] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41355,Cartman,"No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh... "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41357,Cartman,"We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. [strains a bit, like he's gonna cough] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41359,Cartman,"Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild. [coughs] I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday. [moves off] G-goodbye! [locks the lid down once again] All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41363,Cartman,"[not spoken, he's thinking this while Yates speaks.] Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. [closes his eyes and begins anticipating. Three images come up. The first is of his waitress bringing him food, the second is of him dancing before a mariachi band, the third is of the cliff divers. He begins to dance while he daydream] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41365,Cartman,What what what? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41367,Cartman,UUuuugh!! [runs off] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41369,Cartman,[scrambling down the ladder] Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41371,Cartman,"The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41373,Cartman,"They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41375,Cartman,"We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box! [picks it up and promptly drops it over Butters so Butters can't see a thing.] There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41377,Cartman,"Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. [guides him to the ladder and nudges him up] There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top. [Butters climbs out] Good. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41379,Cartman,"Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41381,Cartman,"All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. [walks off. Butters follows] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41383,Cartman,"Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41385,Cartman,We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41388,Cartman,"Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here. [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back] Oh my God! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41390,Cartman,"It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back]  "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41392,Cartman,"We've got to fight them off! [jabs at the air a few times] Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! [makes ""cannibal"" noises] Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41394,Cartman,"[picks up a twig] Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? [goes to Butters' other side and begins breaking off pieces of the twig as he makes more ""cannibal"" noises.] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41396,Cartman,"Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh! [swings it and kills the ""cannibal""] Die! [one last jab, the ""cannibal"" ""croaks"" and it's over] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41398,Cartman,"[feigns exhaustion] The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me, [checks out his hand] which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41400,Cartman,"We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41402,Cartman,"Look! There's an old refrigerator! [reaches it and opens it] Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41404,Cartman,"Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change. [begins to ""change""] No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41406,Cartman,"I love you too, man. I just [goes into spasms] You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! [lunges at Butters, who quickly closes the refrigerator door. Cartman walks up and rips off the door handle, then walks away chuckling to himself. A few seconds later a garbage truck backs up and removes the refrigerator from the gas station] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41408,Cartman,"Hah! [turns off his bear alarm clock, hops out of bed cheerfully and skips to his wall calendar he made just for the occasion.] It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday! [crosses off Tuesday on his calendar] Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool! [walks off to get dressed] Oh, that would be so bad-ass! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41412,Cartman,"We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41415,Cartman,"[sniffs] ""Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41417,Cartman,"What? Fuck Kyle. [the others look at him in astonishment] Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41418,Cartman,Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41435,Cartman,"We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita! [the boys climb out of the car] Aw man, this is gonna be so great! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41444,Cartman,But... Casa Bonita. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41446,Cartman,[turns to face Casa Bonita] But I... [turns back] but... [suddenly takes Kyle hostage] Stand back! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41448,Cartman,[backs up towards the restaurant with Kyle still hostage] I! Am going! To Casa! Bonita! [sirens are heard] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41450,Cartman,[hauls Kyle away a bit longer] Ah! Eh. Nuh! [throws him away and dashes for the entrance] Less than a minute! Less than a minute! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41453,Cartman,"Oh, awesome!! [approaches a table which has a family enjoying its dinner] Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your- [grabs some food from both the mother's plate and the father's plate] Thank you. Thank you. [climbs over the table] Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave! [hops off and runs for the cave, barging his way past two other kids] Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave! [runs in] Oh! [stops at a treasure chest with a pirate skeleton beside it] Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton! [moves on] Oh man, I'm so scared! [exits]  "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41454,Cartman,"Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers! [rushes to them, stopping long enough to dance before the mariachi band] Come on! Come on, dive! [atop the waterfall, a cliff diver stands ready] Dive, asshole! [the diver dives into the pool below] Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh? [looks towards the entrance and sees the rest of his party and the police enter the restaurant] Whoa. [dashes for the jail set at the Photo Flash Back. He puts on the suit waiting for the next customer and looks out from behind bars. His picture is taken and he quickly jumps down from the cell. He moves on to the table he dreamt about two weeks ago] Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?! [a waitress arrives with a plate of sopapillas] Sweeet! [runs off with it and heads for a new attraction] Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! [an officer steps in and blocks his way, he tosses his dessert away and turns back] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41457,Cartman,"[steps left] Ah. [steps right] Uh. [moves around a bit more, then jumps off the cliff] Yeeeesss! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41460,Cartman,Totally. [smiles] 
7,12,All About Mormons,41470,Cartman,[falsetto] Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41477,Cartman,Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place! 
7,12,All About Mormons,41479,Cartman,"Go kick his ass, Stan. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41482,Cartman,Will he bleed? That's all we care about. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41486,Cartman,"Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan! [then, when Stan is gone, softly] All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41499,Cartman,"They're just standing there, talking. [A few moments later, Stan returns defeated. He glances back at Gary, then approaches the other boys] "
7,12,All About Mormons,41504,Cartman,"You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41672,Cartman,"Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41674,Cartman,"[cooing] Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41678,Cartman,"Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41681,Cartman,"[playing it up] Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41690,Cartman,Oh my God... 
7,12,All About Mormons,41701,Cartman,"[backs away a bit with Kyle and Kenny] Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. [looks at the other two. All three move off to their left and leave] "
7,12,All About Mormons,41703,Cartman,"Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. [an awkward moment between Gary and Stan follows] "
7,12,All About Mormons,41792,Cartman,[needling] Oh no! You guys broke up? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41796,Cartman,"Uh oh, the jilted lover returns. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41800,Cartman,"Damn, that kid is cool, huh? "
7,13,Butt Out,41818,Cartman,"I'm going to kill myself. [return to the rap, which soon ends and Butt Out!'s Kyle goes back in line] "
7,13,Butt Out,41824,Cartman,"You guys, Kenny's eating his own hand. [Kenny's chewing on his left hand. Stan and Kyle are half asleep] "
7,13,Butt Out,41843,Cartman,"Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. [the boys quickly turn away and toss the cigarettes and lighter into the trash bin] "
7,13,Butt Out,41846,Cartman,[in clipped tones] Nothing. 
7,13,Butt Out,41848,Cartman,"Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. [moments later Stan sneezes, and a large amount of snot ends up on his face and jacket] "
7,13,Butt Out,41850,Cartman,"Gross dude! [with the stifles broken, the boys resume coughing] "
7,13,Butt Out,41852,Cartman,"No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes. "
7,13,Butt Out,41858,Cartman,We're sorry. 
7,13,Butt Out,41869,Cartman,Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me? 
7,13,Butt Out,41874,Cartman,"[agreeing] Yeah, huh? [launches into a small demonstration] It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah! "
7,13,Butt Out,41886,Cartman,"Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us. "
7,13,Butt Out,41889,Cartman,"Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you? "
7,13,Butt Out,41898,Cartman,Got it! [Stan and Kyle look at each other] 
7,13,Butt Out,41912,Cartman,"[impressed] Isn't he awesome, you guys? "
7,13,Butt Out,41914,Cartman,"Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. [pics up an onion ring and munches on it] "
7,13,Butt Out,41917,Cartman,"Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir. "
7,13,Butt Out,41931,Cartman,"[strokes his chin] Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today. "
7,13,Butt Out,41950,Cartman,"Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them. [cuddles up to Reiner] You are so awesome. "
7,13,Butt Out,41954,Cartman,"Oh my God, that is what I've always said. [motions to Reiner] I love this guy! "
7,13,Butt Out,41959,Cartman,"[eagerly] Wow, a commercial? "
7,13,Butt Out,41961,Cartman,"God, he's just the best! [rushes off to follow Reiner] Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps? "
7,13,Butt Out,41968,Cartman,"So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on! "
7,13,Butt Out,41970,Cartman,"[confused] Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle? "
7,13,Butt Out,41972,Cartman,"Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't [poke] gonna [poke] work [poke] on [poke] me [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke]. Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. [leaves] "
7,13,Butt Out,41974,Cartman,"Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now. [Cartman forgets that hallway doors open in to their respective rooms] Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- [Kyle appears next to him with a glass of water] "
7,13,Butt Out,41976,Cartman,"[drops his hammer in this awkward moment] Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house. "
7,13,Butt Out,41978,Cartman,"Hahahahahaha! [resumes hammering] Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha! "
7,13,Butt Out,41981,Cartman,"[giddily] Heh, okay. [the make-up crew leave] "
7,13,Butt Out,41983,Cartman,"Heh, okay, okay. [takes a deep breath, then strikes a somber pose] You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead. [takes a closer look at that last line, then looks at Reiner] Dead?? "
7,13,Butt Out,41985,Cartman,"Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part? "
7,13,Butt Out,41987,Cartman,"Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry. "
7,13,Butt Out,41989,Cartman,[pushes the cupcake away] I'm not eating the cupcake. 
7,13,Butt Out,41991,Cartman,[realizes what the words he said mean and bolts from the stool] Jesus Christ! HAAAA! 
7,13,Butt Out,41995,Cartman,They're going to kill me! [walks to the other window and looks out] 
7,13,Butt Out,41997,Cartman,The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!! 
7,13,Butt Out,42000,Cartman,[draws close] You guys have to help me! 
7,13,Butt Out,42002,Cartman,"[draws close] Please, you guys, I don't know what to do! "
7,13,Butt Out,42004,Cartman,"If I go, you guys go! "
7,13,Butt Out,42009,Cartman,"Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! [the boys keep their distance] "
7,13,Butt Out,42012,Cartman,"Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! [crosses his arms] "
7,13,Butt Out,42015,Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company! "
7,13,Butt Out,42041,Cartman,"[approaches Reiner] I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! [takes the fork Reiner was holding and jabs it into his belly, Reiner begins to deflate as fat gushes out of the punctures Cartman made with the fork] "
7,13,Butt Out,42047,Cartman,Aw awww! 
7,14,Raisins,42053,Cartman,Right. What are we playing again? 
7,14,Raisins,42055,Cartman,Got it. [the teams get into position] 
7,14,Raisins,42062,Cartman,"What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank! "
7,14,Raisins,42065,Cartman,"Yeh-heah, right! "
7,14,Raisins,42067,Cartman,What a whore! [turns around and goes back to the game. The other boys do the same. Stan is too stunned to move] 
7,14,Raisins,42069,Cartman,"[turns around] Come on, Stan, it's first down still. [Butters looks back, then Kenny. Stan loses heart and walks off slowly, his head hanging low. The other boys look at each other, unsure what to make of that. A montage begins.] "
7,14,Raisins,42101,Cartman,"God, what a fag! "
7,14,Raisins,42120,Cartman,How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet. 
7,14,Raisins,42128,Cartman,"Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts [Lexus winks at Butters] and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade. "
7,14,Raisins,42141,Cartman,"[really stuffed, with a soiled face] Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... [their meals have been served] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42413,Cartman,"Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42418,Cartman,"We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42421,Cartman,"Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42423,Cartman,"I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42426,Cartman,"Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. [walks off in the direction of the other boys. Kyle walks off sadly in the other direction] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42434,Cartman,"HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42436,Cartman,What? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42440,Cartman,"No! No, this can't be happening! [Kenny, Heidi and Clyde remain there as well. Clyde begins to cry.] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42442,Cartman,You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42444,Cartman,Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!! [Stan and Kenny walk in behind him] You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!! [lunges after Kyle] AAAAAA!! [Stan and Kenny jump in and hold him back] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42446,Cartman,"It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42450,Cartman,"[takes off his mittens and coat] This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42452,Cartman,You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42456,Cartman,"Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42476,Cartman,We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas. [this sets it at 8 p.m. December 22] That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42478,Cartman,"[shakes his head vigorously] Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42483,Cartman,You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42485,Cartman,"Of course I care about Christmas- oh, Christ on a stick! [he and Kenny head for the plane] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42487,Cartman,"Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42490,Cartman,Weak. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42498,Cartman,Look out! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42512,Cartman,Oh Jesus Christ. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42526,Cartman,Which road?! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42538,Cartman,[checking his watch] Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. [a mountie appears] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42546,Cartman,"But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42552,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42576,Cartman,How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42601,Cartman,[glaring at Rick] How could you be so stupid! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42606,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down! [puts up his fists] Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! [grabs Kyle by the collar] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42612,Cartman,"We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42616,Cartman,"[hops off the boat and runs towards Parliament] Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! [the rest of the group follows] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42628,Cartman,And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. [sits on the steps] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42632,Cartman,"[through his tears] I'm gonna kill you, Kyle. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42670,Cartman,It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42672,Cartman,"Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents! [takes off his mittens] And what did I tell you, Kyle?! [unbuttons his jacket, takes it off, and bunches it up] I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! [tosses his jacket away] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42674,Cartman,"Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now! [puts up his fists] We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!! [Kyle puts up his fists and gives Cartman a quick right hook across the face. Cartman's eye twitches a few times before he begins to bawl while he's crying.] Mooooooom! Moooooooom! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42681,Cartman,"Pfaha, so funny. [pulls out another firecracker, tosses it before Kyle, and cackles] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42687,Cartman,Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42689,Cartman,"Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42691,Cartman,I'm gonna get those killer sai. [swords with horns at the hilt are in there. Cartman notices a weapon off to the right] Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken [ninja star] for a dollar ninety nine. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42696,Cartman,Parents? Parents?! [fakes a cry] Oh God! [starts crying loudly and turns away.] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42699,Cartman,"Why?! [Stan begins to play along, then covers his eyes sobbing. Cartman turns around, still crying] Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?! [Kenny joins in bawling, and he tightens his hood with the strings] Why?! [Kyle observes his friends, then joins them in the crying] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42706,Cartman,"Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you! [lunges] Iya! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42711,Cartman,[already transformed] Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42713,Cartman,Kick ass! [the boys head out] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42715,Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42718,Cartman,"Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42720,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42722,Cartman,Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. [the boys approach quickly] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42726,Cartman,[shows off his sai] Look what we got. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42729,Cartman,"[moves past Stan] Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42733,Cartman,Ugh. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42737,Cartman,"Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril. [he and the other two turn and walk away as well] Come on, ninjas! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42740,Cartman,"Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42743,Cartman,"We're playing Ninjas, Butters. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42745,Cartman,"No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42747,Cartman,"Yes, and no time to do it. No time... [Butters stands in the open alone] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42760,Cartman,"Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42763,Cartman,I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42765,Cartman,I have the power to have all the powers I want. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42768,Cartman,[protests] C'mon! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42774,Cartman,"Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42780,Cartman,That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42783,Cartman,"All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay! [Cartman attempts to unleash energy with his hands, but nothing happens.] Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42785,Cartman,All right! And now I will use my power to... [faces the other boys] turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! [in an instant Kyle becomes a chicken] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42787,Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42791,Cartman,"Oh, shit, dude! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42800,Cartman,"Guys, meeting over here for a second? [the boys move off and huddle] All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42809,Cartman,"Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42814,Cartman,"[approaches] Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle. [to the huddle] Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42816,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters. [to the other boys] Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. [puts his fingertips to his temples. Kenny touches his right temple, Stan, his chin] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42818,Cartman,Dr. Shafley? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42820,Cartman,So if we make Butters up to look like a dog... 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42828,Cartman,Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. [Kyle hands him the glue] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42830,Cartman,"Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42832,Cartman,"Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42837,Cartman,"Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42842,Cartman,In here! [opens its door and shoves Butters in] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42845,Cartman,"No way, you got weapons too?! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42850,Cartman,"Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42859,Cartman,[the boys are back in anime form] We're twice the ninjas you fags are! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42861,Cartman,"Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42868,Cartman,Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42873,Cartman,"Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42877,Cartman,"We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42882,Cartman,"Here, Butters! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42888,Cartman,Butter- Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42913,Cartman,"Here, Butters! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42922,Cartman,"[with his sais] Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42925,Cartman,"Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42927,Cartman,"Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true. [Kyle continues struggling and begins to grunt] Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle. [closeup of Cartman's lips] Do it. [Kyle struggles even harder, but eventually gives in] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42955,Cartman,All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42957,Cartman,"I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. [steps aside and holds his arms up. He sweeps them down and disappears. He them removes his clothes and gathers them into a pile] This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. [walks over to Stan and hands his clothes over] Here, hold this stuff for me. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42973,Cartman,What? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42977,Cartman,I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. [the adults go into an uproar again] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42982,Cartman,"Hey, fuck you, Kyle! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,42995,Cartman,[approaches Jimmy] The Special Olympics? What's so special about them? 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,42997,Cartman,[snickers] What? 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43004,Cartman,"Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43006,Cartman,What? What'd I do? 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43034,Cartman,[rushes up with the brochure] You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43036,Cartman,"Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" [he looks at his friends as his jaw drops] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43038,Cartman,"So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43040,Cartman,"It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43042,Cartman,"Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. [walks off] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43044,Cartman,Why? 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43046,Cartman,"What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?! [points an accusing finger at him] Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale! [lowers it] Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle! [turns around and walks off. Kyle seethes in silence. Cartman now talks to himself] All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43049,Cartman,Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics. [loosens the chin straps and lowers his face to normal] Bull's eye! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43069,Cartman,"Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey. [the boys stop and look] Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43071,Cartman,"You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away. [This means it's Tuesday prior] I'm going to go sign up now. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43073,Cartman,What?! [takes the brochure back from Kyle] 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43076,Cartman,Moooommmm? 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43078,Cartman,"Um, could I get you to do something for me? "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43080,Cartman,"Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? [Liane looks up and goes pale] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43082,Cartman,I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special. 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43084,Cartman,...I'll split the money with you. [Liane stops] 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43086,Cartman,"[walks up to the table] All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth. [under his breath] God, this is gonna be hard to say. [normally] I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change. [looks up at her with longing, puppy dog eyes.] Help me change? "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43088,Cartman,Awesome. 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43122,Cartman,"[looking really retarded, steps up to the table with his mom] Naaaa! Daaaaa! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43125,Cartman,Naaaa! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43128,Cartman,Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43135,Cartman,...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43157,Cartman,"Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43159,Cartman,"Go on, Kyle. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43161,Cartman,"Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43163,Cartman,"Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43165,Cartman,"Yes. [hops off his seat and consoles Kyle] And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle. [whispers] Good luck. [after a few seconds, Kyle turns around and goes to leave. He opens the door, turns around to say something but instead walks out. Cartman just hums a tune, goes back to the computer and reads some more.] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43183,Cartman,"One thousand dollars, yeah! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43188,Cartman,[hobbles into the fifth position on the track] Daaaa! Daaaa! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43190,Cartman,Whoa. What the hell?? [the girl in position 6 breaks the tape. Cartman hobbles past the finish line four seconds later] 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43195,Cartman,"Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43200,Cartman,[trips over a hurdle] God-damnit! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43204,Cartman,"All right, this one I can win! [drops his pole, takes off his helmet and gives it to another athlete] Here, hold this! [takes up his pole and aims] I'll show you Goddamned retards! [runs up to the posts, plants his pole, and sails up, but the pole won't straighten out. It flexes a few time before it breaks, sending Cartman back down to the track, where he lands on his back] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43207,Cartman,God-damnit! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43216,Cartman,"Ah, screw you hippies! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43218,Cartman,"...I could pile at Shakey's, heck. [puts on his helmet and walks up] Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43220,Cartman,"[humbly] Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43230,Cartman,"Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. [he looks at Kyle and then Stan for a reaction, but neither offers any. He frowns, then steps forward angrily] Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes! [straightens up] Grow up! [walks off in a huff] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43232,Cartman,[in the driver's seat] Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43234,Cartman,"What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew? "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43236,Cartman,"All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew? "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43238,Cartman,"All right, hang on. We're about to land. [the boys make landing noises, with Stan finishing off with a thump. Cartman removes his seatbelt] Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43240,Cartman,"[looks back] It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43242,Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43244,Cartman,Set phasers on stun. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43246,Cartman,Yes. A little too quiet. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43248,Cartman,"Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it! [the boys take their positions and start firing away] Oh no, it got Kyle! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43250,Cartman,"Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off! [pretends to be the monster ripping Kyle's head off] Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43252,Cartman,"Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43255,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43257,Cartman,"How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43259,Cartman,"Go see the movie, Kyle! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43263,Cartman,"You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43265,Cartman,"[focuses Kyle's attention to him] Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43267,Cartman,"Sweet, now I can just play with myself. [fires off his phaser] Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! [races into the minivan] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43286,Cartman,Mom! Doorbell! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43288,Cartman,[the doorbell rings] Mom! Answer the door! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43290,Cartman,"God damn it, lazy-ass whore. [gets up and answers the door himself.] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43294,Cartman,"It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again? "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43296,Cartman,"[closes his eyes and relishes the moment] Mmm, one more time, Kyle. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43299,Cartman,"I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done. [a shot of Mel Gibson's poster, without the ""Braveheart"" on it.] Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43336,Cartman,Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43338,Cartman,"Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43340,Cartman,What? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43342,Cartman,"You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43344,Cartman,"If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43346,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43348,Cartman,Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43350,Cartman,"I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43352,Cartman,Eup. [hangs up and skulks away] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43358,Cartman,"Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43360,Cartman,[turns right so his profile will look sharp as well] Tell them I'll be down shortly 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43362,Cartman,"[wields his short whip]Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. [a shot of the poster.] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43373,Cartman,"Ah, hello everyone. Achtung. [the last few standing people take their seats] My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club. [applause] Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43375,Cartman,"But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. [the guests fall silent] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43378,Cartman,"[bows a few times] Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we [his face turns ugly] all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43381,Cartman,"Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43426,Cartman,"One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message! [some applause] Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world! [the crowd applauds] Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43430,Cartman,"And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."" "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43436,Cartman,[pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43438,Cartman,Es ist Zeit fër Rache! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43441,Cartman,"[picks a mark in front of the crowd] All right, everyone! Forward, march! [they all move forward] Es ist Zeit für Rache! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43443,Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43445,Cartman,Nice. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43462,Cartman,"[from outside] Es ist Zeit für Rache! [congregants rise and face the doors in the back, others look out the windows. They see Cartman leading a march past the synagogue] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43464,Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43466,Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43493,Cartman,[points] Juden! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43505,Cartman,"Mel! Gibson! [brightens and approaches him, then grovels at his feet] Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding! [grovels some more] Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43520,Cartman,"Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43524,Cartman,"Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. [a car goes up a ramp and jumps off] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43608,Cartman,Ha! You just got f'd in the a! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43612,Cartman,Yeah! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43614,Cartman,All right! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43866,Cartman,"All right, Butters! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43880,Cartman,[monotone] Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43882,Cartman,I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43884,Cartman,Yes. I will be your new best friend. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43892,Cartman,"Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43894,Cartman,[snickers] Really? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43896,Cartman,Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43898,Cartman,"[laughs] That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43900,Cartman,"Oh, really? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43902,Cartman,"Heh. Wow, that sucks. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43904,Cartman,Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43906,Cartman,"Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43908,Cartman,What? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43910,Cartman,You saw that? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43912,Cartman,Nuh uh. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43914,Cartman,No way. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43916,Cartman,"[beat] ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43918,Cartman,"Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43920,Cartman,"Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43922,Cartman,"[moments later, still on the bed] Oh, son of a bitch! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43950,Cartman,AWESOM-O does not have a mom. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43956,Cartman,"[under his breath] Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this. [normal. Butters opens up the medicine cabinet] Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43958,Cartman,I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43960,Cartman,What? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43962,Cartman,"Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43964,Cartman,...No way. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43966,Cartman,Weak! [turns right and faces Butters' ass.] 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43968,Cartman,Lame! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43971,Cartman,AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43975,Cartman,Where is it? Where is it?! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43977,Cartman,Wah! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43979,Cartman,"Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43981,Cartman,AWESOM-O understands. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43985,Cartman,"Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43988,Cartman,I would like some Sunny Delight too. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43990,Cartman,"[turns] AWESOM-O will answers the door. [walks towards the door as Butters leaves and opens it. He sees Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43993,Cartman,[normal voice] Shh! [lifts up the helmet part of the outfit] I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43995,Cartman,"Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43997,Cartman,"Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44000,Cartman,"[monotone] Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44004,Cartman,Weak. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44006,Cartman,"Yes, of course. [begins to walk towards the kitchen] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44008,Cartman,"Suck my balls, Kyle. [resumes his walk] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44019,Cartman,Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44023,Cartman,What? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44025,Cartman,Lame. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44039,Cartman,"AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44041,Cartman,Thank you. [walks in the direction Aunt Nellie points to] 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44048,Cartman,"Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. [finishes off the tube, hops down, and tosses the tube aside] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44050,Cartman,Argh! [heads out.] 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44055,Cartman,"Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44064,Cartman,"The New Orleans Saints. [everyone around them laughs, and the producers approach] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44066,Cartman,Seventeen. [everyone laughs again] 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44080,Cartman,"Um... okay. How about this: [the staffers take pen to paper and anticipate the ideas] Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44088,Cartman,"Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44093,Cartman,"You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44095,Cartman,"[growing desperate, walks around] Haaaa! Haaaa! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44097,Cartman,AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44118,Cartman,Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44122,Cartman,...What? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44124,Cartman,AWESOM-O does not understand. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44128,Cartman,[from the boardroom] Lame! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44131,Cartman,Not cool! Totally lame! [runs to his left. Butters looks over his shoulder] 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44134,Cartman,Waaaaa! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44144,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44150,Cartman,"Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44152,Cartman,"The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44154,Cartman,"I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44156,Cartman,"I said I'm a real person, asswipe! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44164,Cartman,"Goddamnit, get me down from here! [the military approaches him] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44166,Cartman,"[enunciating] I'm not a robot, I'm a human! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44169,Cartman,"Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44178,Cartman,"[fidgets frantically] Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44182,Cartman,"Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44187,Cartman,"No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! [raises his helmet enough to show his eyes] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44190,Cartman,I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44197,Cartman,Uh... now ending fart sequence. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44199,Cartman,Smell sequence initiated. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44204,Cartman," [rapping] Would you like to touch my body? Come on and touch my body! Oooo, my hot body! Don't you like my hot body? Come on and touch my titties! I've got such nice round titties! Come on Justin, touch my body! [begins dancing with a life-size cutout of Justin Timberlake] Mmm, Justin, yeah! Touch my body! You and me! Check it out, my nice hot body! Come on, my body!   "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44207,Cartman,Lame... 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44211,Cartman,I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. [a door is heard opening] 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44218,Cartman,No. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44223,Cartman,"Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44226,Cartman,"Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. [they turn away.] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44232,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is awesome! [runs up to a claw machine] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44237,Cartman,"[guiding the machine's arm to grab a plush toy] Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44240,Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44265,Cartman,[breathless] They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! [his chest heaves noticeably] 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44267,Cartman,"They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44269,Cartman,"Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44280,Cartman,Choo-choo train! Yay! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44286,Cartman,"Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44288,Cartman,Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44290,Cartman,...Train together 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44292,Cartman,I've got time. Do youuu?? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44298,Cartman,Choo-choo train. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44322,Cartman,"Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44324,Cartman,You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44326,Cartman,"Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! [faces Kyle down] Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! [turns and walks away angrily] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44350,Cartman,What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44352,Cartman,You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44354,Cartman,"He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, [Stan steps back...] and I- "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44356,Cartman,"Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44387,Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44389,Cartman,"Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. [a knock is heard at Stan's door] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44408,Cartman,Deeper. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44410,Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44413,Cartman,Yeah? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44415,Cartman,Yeah? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44417,Cartman,Yeah? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44452,Cartman,"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! [Stan, Kyle, and Sharon are shocked] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44516,Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44558,Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, hello?! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44592,Cartman,"[hops to Mr. Jefferson's defense, standing in front of him] No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! [a crowd, including the boys' parents, gathers] All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44595,Cartman,"Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child? "
8,7,Goobacks,44609,Cartman,[sweetly] Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars? 
8,7,Goobacks,44611,Cartman,"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am! "
8,7,Goobacks,44613,Cartman,"It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work! [moments later, Stan and Kyle are clearing the driveway while Kenny clears the front lawn, moving by Cartman, who is now seated on the steps talking on a cell phone] Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. [Kyle walks up to him and stops] No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak. [notices Kyle, then lowers the phone] What? "
8,7,Goobacks,44615,Cartman,"Dude, I'm takin' a break. "
8,7,Goobacks,44617,Cartman,"Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers. "
8,7,Goobacks,44619,Cartman,"It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks? "
8,7,Goobacks,44621,Cartman,"Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass! "
8,7,Goobacks,44625,Cartman,Shoveling accident. 
8,7,Goobacks,44627,Cartman,"You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it. "
8,7,Goobacks,44655,Cartman,What?! Who?! 
8,7,Goobacks,44752,Cartman,"We can't understand you, asshole! [the cashier's manager comes up and talks to him for a bit. The cashier points at the boys. The manager takes over and resets the order] "
8,7,Goobacks,44809,Cartman,"Look, it's working! [one by one, the immigrants vanish from view] "
8,7,Goobacks,44817,Cartman,"Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44833,Cartman,"Butters, shut the hell up! [As Mooey dances, PETA bursts in through the double doors and rushes towards the cheerleaders. They apprehend Mooey and begin beating him up, then pulling his head off] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44854,Cartman,"Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44856,Cartman,Ye-heah! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44858,Cartman,"Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich."" "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44860,Cartman,"Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44862,Cartman,It is not! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44865,Cartman,"Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44872,Cartman,"Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44875,Cartman,"It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44881,Cartman,A turd sandwich. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44885,Cartman,Turd sandwich. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44889,Cartman,Turd sandwich. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44891,Cartman,Awwwww! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44894,Cartman,"Okay. You win, Kyle. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44900,Cartman,All right turd sandwich! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44903,Cartman,Giant Douche sucks! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44907,Cartman,"Game on, Jew-boy! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44915,Cartman,"Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives. [Butters begins tossing out the leis, and kids step forth to get them. A man shows up as well, but gets nothing] Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44966,Cartman,"We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44968,Cartman,"Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision. [pulls out a wrapped hard candy and shows it] Butterscotch candy? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44970,Cartman,"Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44972,Cartman,"You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44974,Cartman,"So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44976,Cartman,"Well then, perhaps we could interest you in [pulls out another wrapped candy] another butterscotch candy? [Clyde takes the candy and consumes that one as well] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44991,Cartman,"[interrupts] Hey, fuck off, Kyle. [aside, about Puffy and his crew] Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45050,Cartman,"Aww, suck-up, suck-up! [a man behind him and to his right leans over and shushes him] What?! That's an obvious suck-up move. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45088,Cartman,"Oh, no! Noooo!! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45110,Cartman,"You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45112,Cartman,"Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. [laughs heartily. The other boys stop] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45114,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45123,Cartman,"Whoa, awesome! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45134,Cartman,"[the boys are in the movie aisle] Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45136,Cartman,Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45138,Cartman,"Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45140,Cartman,"Dude, you can't shop for crap. [a wide shot of the store] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45157,Cartman,Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45163,Cartman,"What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45166,Cartman,"What? That's called progress, Kyle. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45168,Cartman,"... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. [gives Kyle the finger, turns around, and walks away. Kyle watches him leave] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45198,Cartman,"[catching up with the other boys] Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45230,Cartman,"You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45232,Cartman,"No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45234,Cartman,"Oh, awesome! [rushes towards Wall-Mart] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45250,Cartman,"[Inside the store] Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents? [freezes in place and hears sounds] Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again? [turns a little angry] Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. [with a look of determination, he leaves the store.] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45253,Cartman,[rushing up to join them] Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45255,Cartman,Nuh-uh. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45257,Cartman,"I am not, Kyle! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45260,Cartman,[pulls out a knife from his back pocket] Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45262,Cartman,You heard what? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45264,Cartman,That's not what I said! [Stan comes out to see what's going on] 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45270,Cartman,[to himself] Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45274,Cartman,[drawing out the syllables] I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45289,Cartman,"Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45291,Cartman,"You speak too much, sir! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45297,Cartman,"[pointing to Kyle] That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45300,Cartman,"[rushes in and blocks their path. holding a dagger] I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45302,Cartman,"No, you didn't. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45304,Cartman,"No, you didn't. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45306,Cartman,"No, you didn't. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45308,Cartman,"No, you didn't. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45310,Cartman,"No, you didn't. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45312,Cartman,"...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu- "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45314,Cartman,"[plugs his ears] I can't hear you! Lalalalalala! [once he's sure Kyle is quiet, he unplugs his ears and pulls out his dagger] I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! [holds out the dagger, ready for battle.] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45316,Cartman,"Very well, Kenny! Let us battle! [Kenny begins delivering blows at Cartman] Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off. "
8,10,Pre-School,45387,Cartman,"Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on? "
8,10,Pre-School,45389,Cartman,"Really? That's cool. When did- [realizes what Kyle has just said and stops completely in place] What did you say? [rushes up to Kyle] Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?! "
8,10,Pre-School,45391,Cartman,"Oh, Holy Jesus, God... "
8,10,Pre-School,45394,Cartman,It's true. 
8,10,Pre-School,45396,Cartman,"He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men. "
8,10,Pre-School,45401,Cartman,Jews can't be firemen. 
8,10,Pre-School,45403,Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew! "
8,10,Pre-School,45406,Cartman,But how do we start a fire? 
8,10,Pre-School,45419,Cartman,"Don't worry, Trent. "
8,10,Pre-School,45422,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing! "
8,10,Pre-School,45438,Cartman,"Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did. "
8,10,Pre-School,45444,Cartman,"Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. "
8,10,Pre-School,45450,Cartman,Whatever. That's like five years from now. 
8,10,Pre-School,45455,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents! "
8,10,Pre-School,45460,Cartman,"You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart! "
8,10,Pre-School,45504,Cartman,"We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters! "
8,10,Pre-School,45506,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister! "
8,10,Pre-School,45508,Cartman,"[now yelling] How the hell are condoms gonna help us?! [the adults in the recovery room look at Cartman] Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. [the adults turn their attention back to Butters] "
8,10,Pre-School,45520,Cartman,"[pulls each item from his backpack and presents it as he mentions it] A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin. [places it at the top of the small tower he's built] All this can be yours. [the Sixth Grade Leader steps off his bike, approaches Cartman, and throws the tower aside] "
8,10,Pre-School,45537,Cartman,"Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool. "
8,10,Pre-School,45550,Cartman,"I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange. [crosses his arms] You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts. "
8,10,Pre-School,45552,Cartman,"Nononono, you gotta go [softly, sweetly] ""But Mo-o-o-om."" "
8,10,Pre-School,45554,Cartman,"[with more feeling] ""But Mo-o-o-om."" "
8,10,Pre-School,45562,Cartman,Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks. 
8,10,Pre-School,45564,Cartman,"Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now. "
8,10,Pre-School,45566,Cartman,Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff! 
8,10,Pre-School,45585,Cartman,All right! 
8,10,Pre-School,45587,Cartman,"You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world! "
8,10,Pre-School,45596,Cartman,Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass. 
8,10,Pre-School,45599,Cartman,"Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a- [drops his cone in fright] Huh?! [before them is a pile of mangled bikes] "
8,10,Pre-School,45615,Cartman,He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. [breathes a silent sigh] 
8,10,Pre-School,45633,Cartman,A picture of your mom's boobs? 
8,10,Pre-School,45644,Cartman,A lot of stupid things that we regret. 
8,10,Pre-School,45648,Cartman,Aaaaaaaah! 
8,10,Pre-School,45650,Cartman,"Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. [the boys hide behind Ms. Claridge's wheelchair, Trent goes around the other side and faces them behind the chair] "
8,10,Pre-School,45654,Cartman,"Stay away from us, Trent! "
8,10,Pre-School,45656,Cartman,"It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse. [steps forward] Just back off, man! "
8,10,Pre-School,45658,Cartman,I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters! 
8,10,Pre-School,45663,Cartman,"Trent Boyett is a liar, sir. "
8,10,Pre-School,45667,Cartman,"Whatever, that's like five years from now. "
8,10,Pre-School,45670,Cartman,"We did it! [walks over to the side of the cruiser Trent is sitting in] So long, Trent! Have a nice time! [Trent grits his teeth in anger as Cartman dances] Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! [turns around and lowers his pants, then shakes his bare at him] Hahahahahaaahaaa! [he forgot to remove the nipple markings from it. Trent grows livid. The six-graders arrive and notice Cartman's buttcheeks.] "
8,10,Pre-School,45672,Cartman,Uh oh. 
8,10,Pre-School,45678,Cartman,Hah! Hey! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45682,Cartman,And I'm Rick Cartman. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45684,Cartman,"Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45687,Cartman,"[serious pose] ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45690,Cartman,"All right, Butters, keep your eyes open. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45694,Cartman,"Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45696,Cartman,Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45699,Cartman,"All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. [the reporters gather in studio] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45706,Cartman,How many students is that? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45709,Cartman,What is that butthole doing now?! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45716,Cartman,"Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45718,Cartman,...You're gay! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45723,Cartman,"Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45725,Cartman,"[softly] God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45732,Cartman,"Go play with yourself, Craig. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45739,Cartman,"[catches up to Kenny] Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45741,Cartman,"You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! [Kenny flashes back to Cartman gloating about their news show]   ""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!"" [Kenny gets annoyed]   [The flashback ends, which the upset Kenny crosses his arms] ...Ah whatever, Kenny! [walks away]  "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45754,Cartman,It should be Sexy News. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45758,Cartman,"Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45760,Cartman,"Nice, Butters, write that down! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45763,Cartman,And panda bears for the preschoolers. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45769,Cartman,"We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45772,Cartman,"Ah, Tolkien, can I have a quick word with you? [takes Tolkien by the arm and walks him away from the door] Look, Tolkien, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Tolkien, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45774,Cartman,"You see Tolkien, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha-, how should I say... white. [Sees that Tolkien isn't following] Tolkien, all the great African-Americans news people have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45776,Cartman,"Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45781,Cartman,"And now, for a look at the weather, here is Tolkien Black, and Tolkien, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45784,Cartman,"[rudely interrupting] Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45786,Cartman,"[cracks up with laughter, then holds up a finger] One testicle! [pounds the desk and laughs] What an asshole! [a short jingle is heard] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45788,Cartman,"Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45791,Cartman,"All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45795,Cartman,"Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got skidmarks Monday. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45797,Cartman,"It's boring news, Jimmy. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45799,Cartman,"All right, tell me about it. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45801,Cartman,"[yawns loudly] Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45811,Cartman,"Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! [hugs Butters] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45821,Cartman,I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45828,Cartman,"How about we have us, um... hmmm. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45835,Cartman,"Wait, I've got it. [the boys turn and look at him] Crab people. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45837,Cartman,"They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45840,Cartman,"[his face buried in his hands] Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45842,Cartman,"How about we do a show where we kill Butters? [time marches on and the boys get sleepy, except for Butters] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45845,Cartman,We have crab people. Just sayin'. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45853,Cartman,That sounds perfect. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45873,Cartman,[taps at his notepad several times with a pencil] Huh. I don't have any ideas yet. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45876,Cartman,"[appears as a blob with echoing voice] Stan, are you getting good ideas? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45879,Cartman,"[with altered voice] Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. [smiles, turns around and walks away] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45881,Cartman,"Oh dude, I just got the best idea! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45886,Cartman,"Dude, this TV show is awesome. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45897,Cartman,"I-I did. I wrote something down. [reaches down and gets his tablet] Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. [shows the drawing to the other boys] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45905,Cartman,"[camera pans down to him] They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45916,Cartman,"And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45927,Cartman,"[gleefully] Haha! In your face, Craig! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45931,Cartman,This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. [Tolkien and Kyle sit across from him with no ideas either] 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45933,Cartman,...I think bail. 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46106,Cartman,"""Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."" [the girls say nothing. Cartman stops, gets angry, and walks back to the first girl he saw, then flips each one of them off. He flips Red off with both hands.] Fuck you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! [leaves.] "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46124,Cartman,"[dressed very casually, with hair slightly unkempt] Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46126,Cartman,"Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46128,Cartman,Kelly Rutherford-Menskin. 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46133,Cartman,"Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter? "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46136,Cartman,"[under his breath] Oh, Goddammit! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46237,Cartman,"This is gonna be totally cool, you guys. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46239,Cartman,"[assessing the situation] ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46243,Cartman,I'm gonna! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46247,Cartman,"Okay, here we go. [steps forward and gets ready to launch himself] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to- "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46249,Cartman,"Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46251,Cartman,"And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! [he flaps his cardboard wings a few times to get some lift, then jumps off the roof. He heads straight for the ground and lands on his face with a grunt. All the boys are shocked and stand there frozen for several seconds. Stan is the first to leave, then Kyle, then the rest of them. Only Butters remains, and he turns to watch the others leave. After a few seconds of uncertainty, he leaves too.] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46259,Cartman,"Eugh... [sits up, his eyes still closed.] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46261,Cartman,Wheh? Where am I? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46264,Cartman,Coma... How long? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46270,Cartman,Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46275,Cartman,"Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46277,Cartman,"Probably in your front pocket, dumbass! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46284,Cartman,Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46287,Cartman,"I don't know, I just knew it. [receives the tray from the nurse and sniffs] Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46298,Cartman,How come the outline is missing its hand? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46302,Cartman,"Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles... [he sees a hand holding Double-Stuff Oreo] Double-Stuff Oreos... [a second hand comes up and twists off the lower cookie] He ... He's taking the top of one and... [squeezes his eyes closed and sees another Oreo attached to the first one so there are two fillings between the cookies] ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs! [the detective writes down what Cartman is seeing] I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46318,Cartman,Guess again. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46320,Cartman,Wow! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46324,Cartman, I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.   
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46326,Cartman,"Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! [shows off the money] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46328,Cartman,Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46330,Cartman,"Do not doubt my powers, Kyle! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46332,Cartman,"Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46335,Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! [closes his eyes and starts making sound effects and hand motions. The boys behind Kyle except Stan and Kenny scatter, and the detectives spot him as they enter the school.] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46337,Cartman,What? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46345,Cartman,I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46351,Cartman,No. Nothing. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46354,Cartman,"Wait a minute. [his right arm twitches and he sees a bucket of chicken, then sees some chicken served next to the powdered doughnuts he saw earlier. His eyes are squeezed tight.] Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh! [sees some syrup poured onto the chicken] There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46359,Cartman,"It is fried chicken! [first he sees a plate of fried chicken, then the maple syrup, then some whipped cream, then some chocolate syrup, then a cherry on top...] Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46367,Cartman," If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands. If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.   [someone knocks on his door, then the door opens]  "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46369,Cartman,"More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46376,Cartman,Proper channels? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46378,Cartman,I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46381,Cartman,"[laughs at them] Ten percent, my balls, get lost! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46386,Cartman,"Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46389,Cartman,In court? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46415,Cartman,"Cool. [the doorbell rings and Cartman concentrates] Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle! [the door opens and the weird man from the crime scenes enters and approaches Cartman] Who are you? "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46417,Cartman,... 'Kay. Sweet. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46419,Cartman,"Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second. [hops off the sofa, walks away a bit, and calls out] Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. [the weird man quickly advances and smothers Cartman's face with a cloth, making Cartman inhale chloroform. Cartman passes out.] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46421,Cartman,"Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46423,Cartman,I don't even know you dude! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46425,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46427,Cartman,"No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46429,Cartman,[nervously] Heheh. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46431,Cartman,"Yes yes, I see! [another Mount Rushmore picture is shown, with the man looking at the camera this time] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46433,Cartman,AAAAAAAH! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46454,Cartman,"Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! [the doorbell is heard. The two detectives are outside, Yates ringing the doorbell. Michael Deets opens the door] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46458,Cartman,(Hey! Come over here!) 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46468,Cartman,"[in the basement] (Hey! Help!) [upstairs, Mr. Deets closes the front door] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46483,Cartman,"No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46485,Cartman,"Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna- [spots the detectives descend the stairs and approach the room] I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! [begins to concentrate and make noises] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46487,Cartman,You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46497,Cartman,You can't hurt me. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46768,Cartman,"I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written ""Write Your Own Christmas Story Day""] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46770,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please? "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46772,Cartman,"[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46776,Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46781,Cartman,That's not at all what happens. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46785,Cartman,"[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] ""Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46836,Cartman,This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46849,Cartman,"Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa! [No response. Cartman can't get a rise out of Kyle] Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46851,Cartman,"Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball! "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46853,Cartman,"Jesus, that's no fun. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46865,Cartman,"You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46977,Cartman,He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47079,Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47081,Cartman,"[walks in and begins to rap the walls with his fist] Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies. [raps on the wall and the pitch changes] Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic? "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47083,Cartman,"Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. [she climbs up until her eyes are level with his] See that? Hippies. [five hippies are sitting in a clearing in the attic, smoking and laughing.] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47085,Cartman,"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47087,Cartman,"Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. [eight hippies are seen seated around a small campfire drumming away. Logs are scattered around them] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47089,Cartman,"Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47093,Cartman,"[goes back to rapping the walls, then stops] Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas. [raps again. The wall begins to crack and he steps aside. A hippie breaks through and falls to the floor. Cartman says under his breath] God dammit! [pulls out a fire extinguisher from his backpack] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47095,Cartman,God damn hippie! [opens fire. Foam spews out from the extinguisher] 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47097,Cartman,Get out of here! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47099,Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47101,Cartman,The college know-it-all hippies. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47121,Cartman,"[opens the door real quick and tosses another hippie down the stairs] All right, in you go. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47124,Cartman,Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! [the throng backs down] 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47127,Cartman,What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47130,Cartman,"Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47132,Cartman,"And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints [tosses a bunch of joints down to the hippies], and a guitar! [tosses that down as well and shuts the door. He then locks it and sets a large beam across the door, then walks away. The hippies are left there, coughing. One of them takes the guitar and sings] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47146,Cartman,"Please, I have to talk to you all right now! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47148,Cartman,"Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47150,Cartman,"I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it. [some surprise is seen among the council members] For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. [puts a laptop on the table and turns it on] At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence. [pulls a projector towards the laptop] Then I saw this... [connects the projector to the laptop, and the projector turns on. Everyone then looks at the screen. Cartman goes to it and points a few things out] Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... hippie music festival. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47152,Cartman,"It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that lasts for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. [the adults don't get it, Cartman sighs heavily] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47154,Cartman,"I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47156,Cartman,It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47158,Cartman,"What are you doing?! [Johnson hauls him away] You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug! [he disappears from view, but peeks in one last time] The town is in serious danger! [Johnson returns to close the door] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47164,Cartman,"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to my basement! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47166,Cartman,"[stops and thinks through what he just heard, then turns around] Oh Jesus, not you guys? [approaches Stan and checks him out] What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47168,Cartman,"Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'd expect the same from you. [the hippie that wore the guitar over his shoulder approaches the boys] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47172,Cartman,Everybody get in a single-file line! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47174,Cartman,"Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47176,Cartman,What? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47178,Cartman,"You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47180,Cartman,"No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! [Barbrady puts him in the passenger seat, then gets into the driver's seat and peels away] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47183,Cartman,What did I do?! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47185,Cartman,"They're not people, they're HIPPIES! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47188,Cartman,"[walks to his cell door] Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47190,Cartman,"[steps back, stunned] You... You what? "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47192,Cartman,They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47194,Cartman,You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! [Cartman snaps]  
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47198,Cartman,"[quickly composes himself] How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippies! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47236,Cartman,"[gets off his bed] Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47238,Cartman,[angered] Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47240,Cartman,[a bit resentful] Forget it. [turns his back on them and walks back to his bed] 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47244,Cartman,"It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47247,Cartman,[turns away again] Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47249,Cartman,I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47252,Cartman,Yes. [turns around] Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47254,Cartman,"All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and be super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! [The adults just look back at him] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47267,Cartman,"All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47269,Cartman,"In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. Our only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here. [points to the stage] If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system. [shows off a CD-R of Slayer music] Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47271,Cartman,We drill. [flips the page and a blueprint appears.] I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. The pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47273,Cartman,"Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47278,Cartman,"All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. [he looks around, panning by Chef once] Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see... [his gaze passes Chef again] Oh, I know. How about- [his gaze falls upon Chef and stays there] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47282,Cartman,"There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we- [his face is distorted. Moments later he sneezes and his face is normal again.] got. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47291,Cartman,"I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog. [his plush toy sits on a chair] Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. [smiles, wipes a tear from his eye, and joins the rest of the crew into the hippie digger. They turn to wave at the townsfolk, who cheer and wave back. Some people take pictures] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47295,Cartman,Primary engine running? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47297,Cartman,Navigation systems? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47299,Cartman,"Let's punch this baby. [the digger rolls off its platform] We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on. [the digger lunges into the crowd, tossing hippies left and right, maybe killing a few in the process. Inside, the crew is jostled about] Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status? "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47310,Cartman,Switching to secondary fuel line. [warning lights begin to flash and warning sounds are heard] What's that? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47322,Cartman,"Come on, come on! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47325,Cartman,"No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47327,Cartman,"...All right, fine Chef, go! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47339,Cartman,Hit the PA system NOW! [the crew goes over to it] Put me in the main line! [Randy turns and shoves an unconscious man at the controls off and gathers some cords] 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47341,Cartman,"You're the scientist, jackass! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47345,Cartman,"Put them in my laptop! [Randy connects one of the cords to the laptop. Cartman selects a song from the Slayer CD he put in the CD-ROM drive: ""Raining Blood"" He clicks ""Play"" and the song blasts forth from the stage speakers. The crowd listens for a while, then begins to disperse.] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47359,Cartman,"Hold it right there, Kyle! [Cartman has a small dagger in its sheath. He pulls it out] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47361,Cartman,"Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you, Kyle. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47363,Cartman,"Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee! [offers the remote control] Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while. [Kyle rises and takes a few steps, but Cartman withdraws the offer] Oh, sorry! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool! "
9,3,Wing,47367,Cartman,Of course he sings. He's black. 
9,3,Wing,47370,Cartman,Two hundred dollars. 
9,3,Wing,47375,Cartman,"You wanna know what it is, guys? "
9,3,Wing,47377,Cartman,"That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side. "
9,3,Wing,47379,Cartman,"[leaves the table] Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Tolkien is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star. "
9,3,Wing,47381,Cartman,"So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Tolkien's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes! "
9,3,Wing,47383,Cartman,"We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Tolkien think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. [strokes his chin] "
9,3,Wing,47387,Cartman,"Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Tolkien there. "
9,3,Wing,47389,Cartman,"Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Tolkien back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk. "
9,3,Wing,47391,Cartman,"Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Tolkien sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit. "
9,3,Wing,47393,Cartman,"[motioning them away] Okay, go go, here he comes. [they leave, and he walks into Tolkien's field of view talking into his cell phone] Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. [stops just before they collide] Oh hey, Tolkien! Buddy, my man, what is up?! "
9,3,Wing,47395,Cartman,"[puts his phone away] Hey, you know, I heard you were doing something down in Denver tomorrow night. "
9,3,Wing,47397,Cartman,"Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Tolkien? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you. "
9,3,Wing,47399,Cartman,This will only take a second. 
9,3,Wing,47401,Cartman,"Welcome to our offices, Tolkien. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm? [they look at the fountains for a few moments, then Cartman turns Tolkien around] Come on over this way, Tolkien. [the other boys come to greet Tolkien] Guys, you remember Tolkien. He's thinking about becoming a client. "
9,3,Wing,47403,Cartman,"Now, Tolkien, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right? "
9,3,Wing,47405,Cartman,"[...and reappear on either side of him] Tolkien, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of. [his phone rings] Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Tolkien. [takes the ""call""] Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln? [Tolkien just looks on. Kyle is stunned that Cartman would mention Lincoln, then gets cross about it] Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now. "
9,3,Wing,47407,Cartman,"I'll I'll call you back, Abe. [hangs up. Kyle pulls him behind the partition] "
9,3,Wing,47409,Cartman,I'm making it look like important people call us. 
9,3,Wing,47411,Cartman,[thinks for a moment] ...well Tolkien doesn't know that. 
9,3,Wing,47413,Cartman,How?! 
9,3,Wing,47415,Cartman,Jew! [Stan comes around the corner] 
9,3,Wing,47417,Cartman,"Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that. [goes to his desk and clears his throat. Stan and Kyle flank him again] Ah, now, where were we? "
9,3,Wing,47423,Cartman,"Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? [slides the contract towards Tolkien, and Tolkien signs it] "
9,3,Wing,47427,Cartman,"From now on, we are an entertainment team, Tolkien. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us. "
9,3,Wing,47433,Cartman,"We represent Tolkien. [hands the man a business card] Give us a call, we'll work out a deal. "
9,3,Wing,47441,Cartman,"Two hundred dollars, Tolkien, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is... "
9,3,Wing,47445,Cartman,Sweet! 
9,3,Wing,47452,Cartman,You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency. 
9,3,Wing,47455,Cartman,"Tolkien, you signed with us! "
9,3,Wing,47457,Cartman,What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby! 
9,3,Wing,47459,Cartman,...Oooo... 
9,3,Wing,47463,Cartman,...Goddamnit! [throws down the $20 bill] 
9,3,Wing,47467,Cartman,"This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! [Tuong Li Kim comes into view, climbing down the stairs] "
9,3,Wing,47477,Cartman,You've ...already done all the work? 
9,3,Wing,47482,Cartman,"We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. [Wing continues singing] "
9,3,Wing,47509,Cartman,Excuse us! 
9,3,Wing,47514,Cartman,"Dude, how long is the wait? "
9,3,Wing,47520,Cartman,"Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone. [clears his throat and whips out his phone] Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is. "
9,3,Wing,47522,Cartman,"Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken. "
9,3,Wing,47525,Cartman,Stupid assholes! [they pass an agent talking on a cell phone] 
9,3,Wing,47530,Cartman,Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well? 
9,3,Wing,47545,Cartman,"Come on, Wing! "
9,3,Wing,47551,Cartman,"She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. [Fernanda delivers more blows until Wing is knocked out and falls to the side] "
9,3,Wing,47553,Cartman,Gay. 
9,3,Wing,47556,Cartman,Your gift of hope is a great deduction. [no one stops to donate. Stallone and his producers come out and approach the boys] 
9,3,Wing,47562,Cartman,"Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. [Stallone mumbles some more] "
9,3,Wing,47566,Cartman,Four thousand dollars? [Stallone mumbles some more and hands his producer a card] 
9,3,Wing,47575,Cartman,That's four hundred for us! We did it! [tosses his cup away] 
9,3,Wing,47578,Cartman,Who let the dogs out? 
9,3,Wing,47580,Cartman,Who let the dogs out? 
9,3,Wing,47582,Cartman,Who let-? 
9,3,Wing,47585,Cartman,"Naw, sh-she was with you! "
9,3,Wing,47587,Cartman,[move forward] Wing? Wing? 
9,3,Wing,47589,Cartman,"Wing? Here, Wing! "
9,3,Wing,47595,Cartman,"Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back. "
9,3,Wing,47600,Cartman,Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients! 
9,3,Wing,47602,Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls. "
9,3,Wing,47605,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys. Look! [they face a two-story-tall fountain with a curving stairway on each side] They do have an amazing fountain. [four guards appear and run down one of the staircases, getting into positions] "
9,3,Wing,47613,Cartman,"Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! [leaves the counter] "
9,3,Wing,47615,Cartman,"Do you wanna play rough?! Okay! [comes out from behind the wall] Take this! [begins firing away. He has no control over the gun, so it fires everywhere. One of the guards is struck down, another one quickly goes up the stairs again] "
9,3,Wing,47626,Cartman,Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it! 
9,3,Wing,47640,Cartman,"Aw aw guys, come on! "
9,3,Wing,47652,Cartman,"Tolkien, you're... waiting tables? "
9,3,Wing,47654,Cartman,"Aw man, that's too bad, Tolkien. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! [""make it simple, to last your whole life long."" Tolkien walks off ] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47659,Cartman,"Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go! [moves to the foot of the bed] MOM, GET UP! "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47661,Cartman,"[goes to the other side of the bed and draws close to her face] Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one! [turns on her light] Come on! [goes back to the door] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47663,Cartman,Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47665,Cartman,I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry! [they pull up to the curb and stop. Cartman gets out of the car] WHAT THE HELL?! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47667,Cartman,"Kenny, when did you get here? "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47669,Cartman,"Friday?! Aw, Jesus! [he switches tactics] I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. [gets in line between Kenny and the Goth Kids] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47671,Cartman,"Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47673,Cartman,"Oh, Goddammit! [moves to the back of the line] They'd better not sell out! "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47677,Cartman,"YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE! [Cartman folds his arms] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47679,Cartman,JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47766,Cartman,(looking bored) Fags! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47768,Cartman,"[suddenly excited and cocky] Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man? "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47772,Cartman,"Who cares? Kenny's dead! [rushes up to the lawyer's desk] When do I take possession of my PSP, sir? "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47774,Cartman,[salivating] Yes! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47789,Cartman,Well... well then he's NOT alive. 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47791,Cartman,"That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. [climbs onto Kenny's bed and holds out a $1 bill] Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar? "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47794,Cartman,"Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47796,Cartman,"Um, it was um, this one time... "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47798,Cartman,"Stupid? PSP is stupid?! [steps forth] Did you all hear that? [steps back to his little group] Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this! "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47800,Cartman,Did so! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47802,Cartman,"Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew! [moves towards the door] I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! [runs out] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47815,Cartman,"You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47817,Cartman,"I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47819,Cartman,"That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. [brings forth a necklace with the left half of a BFF heart medallion] Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47826,Cartman,[comes in with the Chief Justice] He's right in here. 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47864,Cartman,That's right. Respect our authoritah. 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47891,Cartman,I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47893,Cartman,"You say Kenny, but I say tomato! [both sides yell at each other] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47898,Cartman,What? 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47957,Cartman,[runs to the mound] We're done! No more baseball! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47960,Cartman,"All right, we did it! [the rest of the team shows up and celebrates] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47966,Cartman,Post-season? 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47974,Cartman,Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48025,Cartman,"All right, hit one out of the park! "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48033,Cartman,"[sends the ball back to Stan] Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48037,Cartman,All right! [throws it back to Stan] 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48044,Cartman,Ball. Balll. [Stan pitches right down the middle] 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48047,Cartman,"That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery! "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48057,Cartman,What?! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48059,Cartman,"[throws his bat down and walks] Aw Goddamnit! [as Cartman walks to first, anotherr SP runner walks home] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48084,Cartman,"How the hell was that a strike?! [starts kicking dirt on the umpire] Goddamnit, he's going to first! "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48097,Cartman,What happens if we win the State Championship game? 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48135,Cartman,"Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48137,Cartman,"Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48166,Cartman,I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48184,Cartman,[happily] We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48243,Cartman,"Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?! [Sharon arrives] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48247,Cartman,She's got Colonel! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48249,Cartman,Oh boy! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48251,Cartman,"Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy? "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48256,Cartman,"Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48262,Cartman,"[turns around] Well, I saved you all the chicken part. [quiet burp] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48264,Cartman,"[puts on his jacket] Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. [he leaves the kitchen. The boys are puzzled as to what to do about it. Burying his head in his arms, Kenny sobs] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48277,Cartman,"[arriving] Hey fags, what's going on? [no one says a word] Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. [silence] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48280,Cartman,"Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one. [Stan fishes around for some money in his pockets, walks over a bit, and gives it to Kyle] Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes? "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48283,Cartman,"Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle? [neither of them says a thing] Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off? [chuckles. Kenny scratches his right side a bit] Kenny? Kenny?? [the bus pulls up and opens the door. The boys head inside. Stan enters first] Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric! [Kenny enters next] Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents? [Kyle enters last] Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here! [Seeing no reaction, Cartman is stunned. The door closes and the bus pulls away] Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were... [close-up] dead. [dramatic music] No. No, I can't be dead. [runs off] I can't be dead!! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48290,Cartman,No! No!! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48294,Cartman,"Oh my God, this can't be happening! [he then hears his mother wailing softly, then louder] Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true! [he gets closer to her window. Inside his mother's room, on her bed, the black plumber is pounding Liane from behind, but the bed's noise does not reach Cartman's ears. Cartman turns, wailing.] Oh, it's not fair! [falls to his knees and cries out] Why??? Why??? [cries some more. Liane cries out some more as well] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48307,Cartman,"[arriving] Guys! Guys? [the two teams are seen: On screen left are Jimmy, Tolkien, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. On screen right are Timmy, Craig, Clyde, Kevin, and the blond boy. The teams toss the football at each other] Can anybody hear me? You guys?? [approaches Tolkien] Tolkien, Tolkien, I'm here! [leaves] Hello! Hello! Hello! [approaches Clyde] Clyde, can't you feel me? [moves him around, but no reaction from Clyde] Feel me, Clyde! [moves on to Jimmy] Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric! [blows on Jimmy] Jimmy! [puff] Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me! [turns away] They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead. [begins to tear up] Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48315,Cartman,"[walking by, lamenting his fate] What did I do to deserve this?! [Butters pays attention] How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48317,Cartman,...What did you say? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48319,Cartman,Butters... [runs back to Butters] Butters! You can see me?? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48321,Cartman,"Oh my God, and you can hear me?? "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48323,Cartman,"Because, Butters, I'm... dead. [a few moments of silence] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48325,Cartman,"Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48327,Cartman,I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48329,Cartman,"I don't know, but you're the only one who can. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48331,Cartman,"Butters! [tries to open the door, then pounds on it furiously] Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48351,Cartman,Butters... 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48353,Cartman,"Butters, you have to help me! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48355,Cartman,"All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. [pulls out a chain, rattles it, and utters ghostly sounds] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48361,Cartman,[suddenly on the bed] Butters. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48363,Cartman,"Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48365,Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48367,Cartman,What do you mean? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48369,Cartman,"I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48371,Cartman,Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48373,Cartman,"This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! [brings out the chain, rattles it, and makes ghostly noises with his voice] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48380,Cartman,"[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I love her. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48383,Cartman,"[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48385,Cartman,"[emotional] It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48390,Cartman,Just the good times. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48392,Cartman,I can't! Don't you understand?! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48394,Cartman,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48396,Cartman,"[whips out a notepad] All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Tolkien I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. [turns around and walk off] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48407,Cartman,"Okay, that takes care of Tolkien, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess. [turns around] All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48409,Cartman,"[puts away the notepad in his inside jacket pocket.] Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48411,Cartman,"Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48413,Cartman,"[backs up and waves his hands in front of him as if in a haze] G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! [Cartman steps back a bit more, then stops, then is annoyed] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48415,Cartman,"Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on? "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48417,Cartman,What else do I have to do?! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48419,Cartman,Atone? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48421,Cartman,[thinks] Not really... 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48423,Cartman,"Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48425,Cartman,"I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jews exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48427,Cartman,Really? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48429,Cartman,I know how. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48432,Cartman,"Well, there's everything, Butters. [stands up and walks off a bit] I've made everything right. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48434,Cartman,"Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave. [waves his hands around again as if in a haze] Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye... [his back hits the wall under the window, and he looks at his hands] Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48436,Cartman,"I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?! [grabs Butters' bat and begins destroying his room with it. First to go is the lamp on top of the foot locker, then something else, then a picture of Butters sitting on a tree stump, then the television, then the television stand, ] Do you think this is funny? "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48438,Cartman,"[destroys the bookshelves, then the toy area] Stupid butthole God! [chucks the bat at Butters, who leans out of the way. The bat smashes his mirror apart. Cartman leaves. Butters surveys the damage, then his parents show up] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48459,Cartman,Butters. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48461,Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48463,Cartman,"I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look! [shows Butters an ad for a psychic] Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48465,Cartman,She's gonna close soon! Come on! [pulls Butters out of bed and away] 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48472,Cartman,"Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48479,Cartman,"I told you, Butters. [a breaking news item comes on] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48483,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48490,Cartman,"All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48492,Cartman,Don't worry. I have a plan. [movers towards an entrance] 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48494,Cartman,"They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. [Cartman moves towards the front door. The detective notices] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48501,Cartman,"Yes, it's working! [hops on a chair, picks up a book, waves it around, and flips the pages in the lead convict's face] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48516,Cartman,"Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48518,Cartman,"My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48520,Cartman,"We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48522,Cartman,"[backs up again, waving his hands before him] Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him from his right side, Clyde, Tolkien and Jimmy approach him from his left] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48528,Cartman,[pissed off] You son of a bitch Butters! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48530,Cartman,You told me I was a ghost! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48532,Cartman,"How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to [points his finger at Butters] Get you back! [runs off. Butters just looks at him, baffled. His parents arrive with the doctor] "
9,7,Erection Day,48545,Cartman,"Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?! "
9,7,Erection Day,48559,Cartman,"No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. [Jimmy heads back to the sinks and throws water on his face, then throws water on his pants' crotch] "
9,7,Erection Day,48563,Cartman,"Up yours, Butters. "
9,7,Erection Day,48613,Cartman,"Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man? "
9,7,Erection Day,48615,Cartman,"Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food. "
9,7,Erection Day,48617,Cartman,"Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times. "
9,7,Erection Day,48619,Cartman,I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener. 
9,7,Erection Day,48621,Cartman,"Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say. "
9,7,Erection Day,48628,Cartman,"[hiding in some bushes nearby] Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks. "
9,7,Erection Day,48637,Cartman,"[at a nearby booth] Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."" "
9,7,Erection Day,48640,Cartman,"[Roma sets some plates of food on his table] All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."" "
9,7,Erection Day,48644,Cartman,"All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful."" "
9,7,Erection Day,48651,Cartman,"Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice. "
9,7,Erection Day,48655,Cartman,Aaagh! 
9,7,Erection Day,48762,Cartman,"[starts off with his back to the audience, then turns around] D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48792,Cartman,"Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48794,Cartman,You know how? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48796,Cartman,Well here. [reaches down to grab something] Roy keeps the keys in the glove box. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48798,Cartman,"Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48800,Cartman,[puts on sunglasses as the engine purrs to life] Awesome. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48802,Cartman,We're not moving. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48804,Cartman,Maybe you have the parking brake on. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48806,Cartman,Other way! Other way! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48808,Cartman,"Stan... beaver dam! [the boat approaches the dam quuickly] Very large beaver dam, Stan!! [the boat runs aground on the dam and the boys quickly jump out. The boat begins to smoke as the boys swim to the nearest shore. Stan, being lighter and faster, reaches shore first, then turns to wait for Cartman. The boat blows up and Stan shields his eyes. Cartman reaches the shore and walks up to Stan] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48810,Cartman,[turns around and sees] Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48812,Cartman,I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48814,Cartman,"Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! [hustles up the beach] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48816,Cartman,"[turns to look at Stan] Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! [Cartman turns back and continues up the beach. Stan turns and follows Cartman up] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48845,Cartman,Yeah. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48847,Cartman,"Shyeah, that was pretty funny. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48849,Cartman,"Hehey, no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48851,Cartman,Well they should've gotten out of there! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48853,Cartman,We did! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48855,Cartman,"Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48857,Cartman,"Oh hey, Kyle. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48860,Cartman,"[smiling proudly] Hngh, totally. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48862,Cartman,[throws down his cap] Aw crap! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48932,Cartman,"[arrives] Hey Stan. [studies Stan and Kyle's faces] Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48934,Cartman,"Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48937,Cartman,Why? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48957,Cartman,"[turns around and heads towards Stan] Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle! [Kyle turns and looks at him] ""Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."" "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49003,Cartman,Help! Help! [a large drum falls from the ceiling in front of Kyle] 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49013,Cartman,"Not so fast, Kyle. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49015,Cartman,Hand over the gold! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49017,Cartman,You know what I'm talkng about! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49019,Cartman,All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49022,Cartman,"[pulls out a 9 mm handgun, hopefully fake.] I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49024,Cartman,"Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49026,Cartman,"I want... your Jew gold! [Kyle has run out of things to say and stands there. Cartman glowers at him, ready to fire the gun if he moves] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49028,Cartman,"[moves the bag around for heaviness] Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!! [Kyle, angered at this delaying tactic, pulls out another small bag from under his coat and walks over to Cartman. Cartman laughs evilly as Kyle approaches. Kyle smiles an evil smile back and tosses the second bag over his shoulder and into the fire below. Cartman rushes over to grab it, but doesn't get there in time Kyle rushes up the stairs at the other end of the landing] No! Noooooo! [watches the fire] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49030,Cartman,"Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! [runs up to the platform and jumps on. The helicopter flies off] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49045,Cartman,...Aw man. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49055,Cartman,"[steps forward] Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe. "
9,9,Marjorine,49083,Cartman,"[closes the door and comes downstairs] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge. "
9,9,Marjorine,49085,Cartman,"What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future. "
9,9,Marjorine,49090,Cartman,"Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true. [pulls TV from the back] I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera [shows the camera]. I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children. "
9,9,Marjorine,49092,Cartman,Video playback initialized. [presses play on the remote control and the screen shows the girls playing] 
9,9,Marjorine,49119,Cartman,"Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image! [presses the pause button] Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device. "
9,9,Marjorine,49121,Cartman,[comes to Clyde and Kevin's table] How is the incubation shield coming Clyde? 
9,9,Marjorine,49123,Cartman,"Good man. [goes over to the computer Kyle, Stan, and Tolkien are working on] Any luck here? "
9,9,Marjorine,49125,Cartman,"Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it. [moves to the middle of the tent] All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here. "
9,9,Marjorine,49127,Cartman,"Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over? "
9,9,Marjorine,49129,Cartman,"Heidi Turner [turns on a projector on which is shown her picture] is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it. "
9,9,Marjorine,49131,Cartman,"No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town. "
9,9,Marjorine,49133,Cartman,"No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that! "
9,9,Marjorine,49135,Cartman,"Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy. "
9,9,Marjorine,49147,Cartman,"[behind Butters] Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. [Clyde, Stan, and Craig dress the pig while Cartman makes a Butter mask for it] "
9,9,Marjorine,49150,Cartman,"Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. [the pig is done, Butters steps down, and the pig is shoved into place] "
9,9,Marjorine,49153,Cartman,"Okay. One! Two! [Craig, Clyde, and Stan push the dressed pig] "
9,9,Marjorine,49158,Cartman,Nice. 
9,9,Marjorine,49167,Cartman,"[whispers to Stan]Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. [clears his throat] "
9,9,Marjorine,49174,Cartman,"[pretends like he's yawning] Dude, they totally think he's a girl. [coughs] "
9,9,Marjorine,49178,Cartman,"[pretends like he's yawning] Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker. [coughs] This is going swimmingly. [coughs] "
9,9,Marjorine,49206,Cartman,"Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it. "
9,9,Marjorine,49212,Cartman,"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out. [Kyle glares at him] "
9,9,Marjorine,49226,Cartman,God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it. 
9,9,Marjorine,49261,Cartman,That son of a bitch! 
9,9,Marjorine,49264,Cartman,Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?! 
9,9,Marjorine,49266,Cartman,"You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device. "
9,9,Marjorine,49268,Cartman,Working on what?! Your dance moves?! 
9,9,Marjorine,49270,Cartman,"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! [hangs up] "
9,9,Marjorine,49285,Cartman,"Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! [Clyde runs up, gets it, and runs off] "
9,9,Marjorine,49289,Cartman,"aahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! [turns around and runs as the other boys run away] "
9,9,Marjorine,49310,Cartman,"Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. [handles the future-telling device with black gloves] "
9,9,Marjorine,49312,Cartman,"No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions. "
9,9,Marjorine,49314,Cartman,"Because I do, Clyde. "
9,9,Marjorine,49316,Cartman,I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty? 
9,9,Marjorine,49320,Cartman,Will you all shut up so I can do this!? 
9,9,Marjorine,49330,Cartman,Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!? 
9,9,Marjorine,49332,Cartman,Think of the power! 
9,9,Marjorine,49335,Cartman,Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future. 
9,9,Marjorine,49337,Cartman,"Damn, Ken. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49496,Cartman,I broke the egg. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49498,Cartman,"I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49500,Cartman,...No. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49502,Cartman,"No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49504,Cartman,Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49506,Cartman,"[thinks about what just happened] Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49508,Cartman,...Why are you doing this? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49510,Cartman,What do you want from me? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49512,Cartman,...No. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49514,Cartman,[choking] Yes teacher. 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49609,Cartman,"[walks up to the front of the class and turns around, looking at his paper] Thank you, Mrs. Garrison. [reads] My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles."" [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids. [cues up his pics. A red-headed boy appears] Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. [next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone] Aw, nasty! Yuck! [returns to his paper] This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49611,Cartman,"Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. [another redheaded girls pops up] Ah sick! [another redhead] Gross! [another redhead] Yeck! [returns to his paper] Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... [a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up] vampires. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49614,Cartman,"I was getting to that, if you will let me. [returns to his paper] Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" [cues up a picture of Kyle, with ""daywalkers"" written underneath] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49617,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49623,Cartman,"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth! [Kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself] Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, [next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth] and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, [the last pic is that of Carrot Top] think again. [the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49652,Cartman,"Informative if you want to die. [hops off his seat and joins Butters and Kyle] Guys, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all. [moves towards the door] Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! [points at Clyde, who jumps back.] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49671,Cartman," -ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille  Four hungry children and a-  "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49673,Cartman,I'M GINGER! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49675,Cartman,Help me! Hellp mee! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49680,Cartman,And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49682,Cartman,So I'm gonna stay like this forever? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49685,Cartman,"Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like! [crosses his arms] Right, Mom?! [a bit shocked when she doesn't answer right away] Mom?! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49689,Cartman,"Hey dudes, what's goin' on? [coughs to clear his throat] How is everything with you guys? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49691,Cartman,"Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49693,Cartman,"Actually, gingervitus is the medical term. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49695,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle. [coughs] The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49697,Cartman,"What do you mean, Kyle? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49699,Cartman,"[thinks] Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. [the school bus pulls up and opens its doors. The kids climb in and find seats] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49701,Cartman,"That's fine, just get it out of the way... "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49705,Cartman,"[Walks up to an empty space between Clyde and Tolkien] Hey Clyde, Tolkien. Sup, Jim? [begins to eat] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49707,Cartman,I'm grubbin'. What's it look like? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49709,Cartman,Huh? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49711,Cartman,But... it's me. 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49714,Cartman,"Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. [the camera looks around at the other kids at the table, who remain silent] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49719,Cartman,"I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49721,Cartman,"Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49723,Cartman,"...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like... [he can't think of any] Like uh... [looks up in thought, then softly] Liiike... "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49725,Cartman,Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand... 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49727,Cartman,"Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49730,Cartman,Red Power! [Stan stops the game and the boys look at the source of commotion. Cartman leads the gingers across the playground] 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49732,Cartman,Red Power! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49734,Cartman,Red Power! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49736,Cartman,Red Power! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49738,Cartman,"We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49740,Cartman,[resumes the march] Red Power! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49742,Cartman,Red Power! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49745,Cartman,Red Power! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49749,Cartman,Red Power! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49751,Cartman,Better red than dead! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49753,Cartman,Better red than dead! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49756,Cartman,That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49758,Cartman,The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49761,Cartman,"There she is! Get her! [the gingers rush her and start ganging up on her] Die, you stupid bitch! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49765,Cartman,"[comes in pumped up like a televangelist to his own theme music] Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'? [the redhead cheer] Can I get a Red Power? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49767,Cartman,"Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49769,Cartman,"Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! [all the redheads cheer wildly] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49771,Cartman,"We're fine, thanks. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49773,Cartman,We're fine! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49775,Cartman,"You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!! [Gary closes the door] My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49779,Cartman,Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49824,Cartman,My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! [the gingers stomp and cheer] 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49827,Cartman,"What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! [more stomping and cheering] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49829,Cartman,"No, we're fine! Thank you! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49831,Cartman,Yes! We're good! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49833,Cartman,"You're welcome, now leave us alone!! [Gary leaves and closes the door] Now! Let the extermination begin! [more stomping and cheering] We will start... with the daywalker! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49836,Cartman,Go on then! Say your last words! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49838,Cartman,"Okay fine, let him speak! [the redheads let Kyle go, and Kyle falls on his face] Then we kill every non-ginger here! [Kyle gets up, walks over to Cartman, and whispers in his ear. Cartman's anger vanishes, then surprise appears] You... you what? [Kyle repeats himself. Cartman looks around a bit fearfully, then touches his face all over and grits his teeth] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49841,Cartman,"[now hesitant] Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something. [backpedals] We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us. [throws away his staff] What have we become? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49843,Cartman,"D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49845,Cartman,"Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49847,Cartman,"See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. [the gingers look at him, stunned] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49849,Cartman,... Huh? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49851,Cartman,"Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49853,Cartman," No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along. Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same. Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys! Hand in hand, we can live together.   "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49855,Cartman,That's it! You've got it! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49857,Cartman,Live together! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49859,Cartman,"The same, you and I! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49862,Cartman,"Yes, but I'm not going to die. [steps forth] That's why we gotta get along, people! "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49867,Cartman,"Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again! "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49870,Cartman,"HA! Saving money, duhhh! [turns left and walks. The others follow. Kenny moves the card in his left hand to his right hand] "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49872,Cartman,"Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49875,Cartman,"Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49878,Cartman,"Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. [he, Kenny and Kyle walk off] "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50069,Cartman,"Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. [leaves] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50143,Cartman,I'm all wet! Sweet! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50146,Cartman,Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50148,Cartman,Yes! Yeehehehes! [Jambu returns with Kelly on his nose as if she were a hood ornament] 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50151,Cartman,I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50153,Cartman,Why? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50155,Cartman,"Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50157,Cartman,Killer. [the boys turn and leave] 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50159,Cartman,"Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. [turns to catch up with Stan and Kenny. Kyle walks around the tank] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50178,Cartman,"[slapping the water as a stingray approaches] Heh! Come on, stingray! [it speeds away. Another one approaches] Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me! [it speeds away as well] Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50186,Cartman,"Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50190,Cartman,"Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50199,Cartman,You live on the moon? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50265,Cartman,Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50305,Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to keep him wet. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50311,Cartman,He hasn't said a word since we brought him here. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50344,Cartman,"Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50347,Cartman,We have to hurry! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50352,Cartman,Uh oh. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50416,Cartman,Oh crap! There's more of them! [police cruisers pour in and officers pour out of them] 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50434,Cartman,"Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. [Stan looks at the sky and steps forward. The other boys join him. Before them, up in the sky, is the full moon, bright and nicely detailed] "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50449,Cartman,Ichi banzai 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50451,Cartman,Ichi banzai! Kya! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50453,Cartman,I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves. [an aside] I'm a little better than everyone else here. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50455,Cartman,"Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50458,Cartman,"Yeah, let's go. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50474,Cartman,"Sure, whatever dude. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50482,Cartman,"[turns around] No, dude, it's the police. [the sirens are heard] "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50500,Cartman,"Dude, what the hell is he doing? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50508,Cartman,"You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50511,Cartman,"Man, that was such a bummer. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50513,Cartman,Why? 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50515,Cartman,"All right, Stan. Sure. [the school bell rings and Mrs. Garrison enters with her books, setting them on her desk] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50717,Cartman,I'm gonna miss him. [Butters walks forward a few steps and puts his hand on the sofa] I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! [turns his head left and cries into his left arm] 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50732,Cartman,"[draws two and puts one down] Reverse to you, Jew. [the doorbell rings] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50737,Cartman,All right! [applause comes out of nowhere. Chef gives them a hug] 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50764,Cartman,"Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you? "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50771,Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50784,Cartman,[The boys are stunned] Excuse me? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50817,Cartman,"...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50823,Cartman,Yeah! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50826,Cartman,"Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. [they step off on the other side and approach the front door. Stan reaches over and pulls the rope that rings the house's bell. A black butler opens up] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50853,Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50872,Cartman,"No, Chef has always been super-cool. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50875,Cartman,So what can we do?? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50889,Cartman,"Come on, bitch! Dance! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50891,Cartman,"Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50901,Cartman,"It's ok Chef, Go on, remember! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50915,Cartman,"Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50942,Cartman,Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50948,Cartman,Run Chef! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50969,Cartman,"A mountain lion! [the lion grabs at Chef's right arm, but is having trouble ripping it off] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50974,Cartman,A grizzly bear! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50979,Cartman,"Maybe- maybe he's still okay. [the other boys look at him, dumbfounded] No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your- "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50981,Cartman,Oh never mind. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51071,Cartman,[walks into the living room with a pitcher and cups of pop] Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! [blows into a noisemaker and makes it stick out. Other kids walk up and take cups away] 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51073,Cartman,Who? [smiles innocently] 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51075,Cartman,Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51080,Cartman,"You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! [Stan leaves]'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51113,Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing? "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51115,Cartman,"THAT's gay, heh. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51117,Cartman,Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51119,Cartman,"[fears that for a moment, then] Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! [walks out] "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51193,Cartman,"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51195,Cartman,"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51197,Cartman,"No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51200,Cartman,Who? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51204,Cartman,[clearly doesn't know what's happening] The smug? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51231,Cartman,[puts on the gloves] I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51233,Cartman,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters. [zips the suit up] It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old. [turns around and sighs] I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. [reaches down, picks up the helmet, and puts it on, locks it in place, and pressurizes the suit. Communication resumes through the intercom] All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51235,Cartman,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle. [turns around] I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. [begins to walk slowly and deliberately into the city] "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51243,Cartman,"[checking in] Butters, are you there?! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51245,Cartman,I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51247,Cartman,Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51249,Cartman,Turning right at O two four niner. [turns right at the corner and continues walking] 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51256,Cartman,"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51259,Cartman,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51261,Cartman,Oh my CHRIST! [runs up to Kyle's room and kicks the door open. Kyle and Ike are as wasted as Gerald and Sheila are. They sit on the floor with their backs against Ike's bed] Kyle? Kyle! 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51264,Cartman,"[trying to shake Kyle to his senses] We have to get out of here! Now! [lightning strikes the house, which begins to burn. The lights begin to flicker, and the camera zooms in on Cartman, who continues shaking Kyle] Kyle! Kyle!! [the screen goes black] "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51292,Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle? "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51294,Cartman,"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51296,Cartman,"Ah, that's better. [smiles] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51346,Cartman,You TiVo every episode of Family Guy? 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51349,Cartman,"Yich. [Kyle has reached his target. The Family Guy living room is shown. Peter is in his armchair, the rest of the family is on the sofa] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51361,Cartman,Yich. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51369,Cartman,"Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51371,Cartman,"What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in silence] What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51374,Cartman,"That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51376,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!! [turns and heads for the front door, then turns back and aims his index fingers at the other boys] It's wrong! [opens the door, heads out, and closes it behind him. Kyle's parents walk in from the kitchen with their survival gear] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51389,Cartman,"Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51391,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy? "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51399,Cartman,What? 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51408,Cartman,Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51410,Cartman,"You guys, this is serious! We have to do something! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51412,Cartman,We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me? 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51414,Cartman,Then we'll ride our Big Wheels. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51416,Cartman,"If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51418,Cartman,"Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle? "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51420,Cartman,"All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny? [Kyle stifles an answer] What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle? [Kyle's jaw drops] I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. [walks off] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51436,Cartman,"Come to try and stop me?! [...a bigger box of Cheesy Poofs...] It isn't gonna work. [...a can of Dr. Pep-er, a can of lemon-lime soda...] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51438,Cartman,"[...Snacky Cakes...] Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this. [...another can of Dr. Pep-er...] Especially one who doesn't trust me. [seals his knapsack shut] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51440,Cartman,"[turns around slowly] Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51442,Cartman,You know we might not even make it into the studio. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51444,Cartman,So what made you change your mind? 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51446,Cartman,"Well Kyle, we'd better get going. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51448,Cartman,Are you set? 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51450,Cartman,"All right, let's roll! [they ride off, slowly] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51465,Cartman,"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51467,Cartman,"It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51469,Cartman,"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51471,Cartman,"[gets off his Big Wheels, his anger sudden and strong, and walks up to Kyle] Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! [turns and goes back to his Big Wheels] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51473,Cartman,"Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."" [turns and faces Kyle] I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51475,Cartman,YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51477,Cartman,Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! [begins to walk towards his Big Wheels] 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51479,Cartman,"Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw? "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51482,Cartman,"Kyle, stop it! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51484,Cartman,Holy Crap! [swerves to the right] 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51507,Cartman,"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51509,Cartman,"[riding into the distance] Suck mah balls, Kyle! [Kyle sobs a little, then pounds his left fist into the sand along the side of the highway] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51519,Cartman,"[...and reaches a slow, undulating glowing light, judging from the reflection coming off him] This... explains everything. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51523,Cartman,"[he and Kyle fight in a burning studio] Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51531,Cartman,I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51535,Cartman,"Kyle, stop it! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51537,Cartman,"So long, Kyle! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51560,Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51562,Cartman,"It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51564,Cartman,"Dude, can I go before you? "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51577,Cartman,"So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh? "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51579,Cartman,So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air? 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51581,Cartman,"Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51583,Cartman,Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51585,Cartman,"...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51587,Cartman,['This is manipulation at its highest level you should let me handle this. ']
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51589,Cartman,Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done? 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51591,Cartman,"Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51593,Cartman,Seeya. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51619,Cartman,"[removes his cap] Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow... "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51621,Cartman,"You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened. [shocked looks on the faces of the staff] First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility. [coughs] Ow.. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51625,Cartman,I'll certainly do my best. [coughs] Ow. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51627,Cartman,"[turns and walks out, and says softly with an evil smile] Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51629,Cartman,"[stops and turns] I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. [walks out again] "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51650,Cartman,"It won't take long, sir. [coughs with more energy] Ow... "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51652,Cartman,"[removes his cap] Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51655,Cartman,"[stops and stares] Wha? [before him is a wall tank the height of the writing room. Manatees are swimming slowly within, and a huge pile of plastic balls sits at one end of the tank. Some of them are snacking on small fish] What are they? "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51657,Cartman,"Family Guy is written by manatees? [rethinks] Of course, it all makes sense now. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51666,Cartman,Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51668,Cartman,"Oh... yes, yes. Um [clears his throat and talks to the tank] hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you- "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51670,Cartman,Why not? 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51672,Cartman,[softly] Son of a bitch. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51675,Cartman,"[voice] Well well well! [now shown walking up to Bart, who's keeping watch while leaning on his skateboard. Cartman has a mean air of satisfaction on him] "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51677,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51679,Cartman,"You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51683,Cartman,"Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51686,Cartman,"Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle, [turns and walks away] I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51694,Cartman,"[hobbles up to him] Sir! Sir! [faces him] If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you. [they both turn to face the tank] Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51698,Cartman,I did it. I... AM... GOD!!! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51700,Cartman,"Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51702,Cartman,How the hell did you get out? 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51704,Cartman,"Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51706,Cartman,"You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51708,Cartman,[runs ahead and cuts him off] I can't let you do that! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51710,Cartman,"[takes off his mittens] Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable. [Kyle removes his left mitten with his teeth and spits it away] Let this be our final battle. [they put on their battle faces and begin fighting, which is shown dispassionately. It's all a long series of slaps] Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah! [they begin to move along a sidewalk] Ugh. Kyle! Stop it! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51712,Cartman,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! [throws him up against a wall. They slap each other some more and Kyle throws Cartman up against the wall. Some more fighting and Cartman throws Kyle up against a window, but they both crash through it into the King of the Hill offices.] "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51714,Cartman,Stop it! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51716,Cartman,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out. [Kyle stops his attack and a few seconds of silence follow. Then] Time in! [slaps Kyle hard. Kyle waits for a writer to stop staring, then resumes his attack] I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51718,Cartman,"Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51720,Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls! [throws Kyle off, but they resume fighting] Kyle! [Kyle finally gets Cartman in a reverse headlock. A few seconds later, he begins punching Cartman on the ribs] Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle! [gets out of the headlock, but the fighting resumes] Okay... Okay! Okay okay! [the fighting stops, and they're both panting] You win! You win. I give up. [kicks Kyle square in the nuts. Kyle doubles over in pain, coughing, and Cartman grins] Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. [Kyle is still immobile, but a skateboard whacks Cartman from behind. Cartman falls over and Bart is there] "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51739,Cartman,"Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51743,Cartman,No! Think about the people who could get hurt! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51745,Cartman,"Okay, I'll make it easy for you. [pulls out a gun and aims it at the president] Pull the Mohammad episode, now! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51750,Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51753,Cartman,"Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51759,Cartman,"No gay speeches, Kyle! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51766,Cartman,"No! No, I hate Family Guy!! [tries to fire the gun, but it seems to be empty. No bullets come out. He throws it down.] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52099,Cartman,"[giggles as he dribbles] Check out this sweet move. [tries to dribble around Kyle, but Kyle blocks him] Kyle, you can't block like that. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52102,Cartman,"Hang on. I'm going to do something killer. [tries to fake Kyle out, but Kyle taps the ball away. Cartman goes after it] God damnit, stop it, Kyle! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52104,Cartman,"[tries again, moving Kyle back some] All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. [keeps dribbling without making a move] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52107,Cartman,"Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy! [again tries to get by Kyle, but Kyle taps the ball away again. Cartman chases it down again.] Kyle, knock it off! [the beast breaks through the bushes and steps onto the basketball court. Cartman continues to dribble] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52111,Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52124,Cartman,"No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52147,Cartman,"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52159,Cartman,"Ah I don't think so, dude. [the boys head for the door] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52162,Cartman,You... have that kind of power? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52202,Cartman,Somebody get us some help down hyah! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52204,Cartman,Hello?? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52209,Cartman,"[pointing at Stan] You'd better get us out of here, asshole! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52211,Cartman,You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52215,Cartman,"[scrambling along his own path] This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off! [loses his footing and slides down some distance to the floor. He gets up and coughs from all the dust that went up around him] Goddammit! [reaches down and grabs his flashlight. He slaps it until it comes back on, coughs, and looks ahead. His eyes grow big. Before him is ""Smuggler's Den,"" a corner of the cave in which sits an open treasure chest and two skeletons guarding it. Gold and jewelry are in and around the chest, while the skeletons have guns in their hands. Cartman approaches slowly, in awe] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52219,Cartman,"[in a soft, trembling voice] No, nothing [clears his throat and speaks normally] No, nothing here! Nothing this way! [his eyes fixed on the look, he swoons] Tr... treasure. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52221,Cartman,"I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! [turns to head back to the other boys, but turns around one last time to remember where the treasure is, then heads back to his friends.] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52226,Cartman,"You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. [the other three boys turn to face him] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52228,Cartman,"I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52230,Cartman,"No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52232,Cartman,That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there [points to his last location] if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52247,Cartman,"I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52251,Cartman,"[softly throughout] All that treasure. [gets excited] It's all mine! [gets angry] So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it! [looks at the other boys] You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys! [begins to crawl towards Kyle] Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass! [reaches Kyle so that his face is smiling evilly down at Kyle's face. He whispers] Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. [Kyle stirs and wakes up] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52253,Cartman,"[says nothing for a few seconds, then] Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52255,Cartman,"Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52257,Cartman,"Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. [gets off Kyle] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52267,Cartman,"[determined] All right. Gotta be strong. [looks at the coins in his hands] There's still a lot more treasure to go. [begins to swallow the coins and wash them down with ""WOTTUR."" He soon runs into some difficulty swallowing and drinking, so it seems like he's puking. The other three boys are awake and listening with concern] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52279,Cartman,"Meh, meuh urgh. [coughs] Mbeuh. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52281,Cartman,[cough] I'm fahn. Just a lit- [gulp] No big deal. [burps] Beh. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52285,Cartman,"NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. [coughs] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52290,Cartman,"Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. [grunts, and a fart comes out. His face lights up in alarm] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52293,Cartman,"You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! [the boys pull again.] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52299,Cartman,"Yes you do! [something drops, and the roar of flooding water is heard] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52301,Cartman,"No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52312,Cartman,Grab my hand. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52314,Cartman,I can't kick! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52316,Cartman,I can't! Kick yourself back to safety! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52318,Cartman,"No, you just have to save me. [Cartman stops and begins to drop down to the bottom, taking Kyle with him] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52332,Cartman,"No! No I'm fine! [begins to walk with difficulty] I just need to get home, a-and rest. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52334,Cartman,[leaving] Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I... [stops] habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! [his pants rip open in the rear and much of the treasure he had swallowed comes flying out of his body. Then he farts. A long silence follows as everyone looks at him and at the fake treasure he just pooped out] 
10,6,ManBearPig,52336,Cartman,"It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52338,Cartman,"That's right, and I... [looks at the tour guide] Fake treasure? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52340,Cartman,Noo... NOOO!! [craps out some more treasure] NOO! OW! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52342,Cartman,"Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! [craps out even more fake treasure] Dowww! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52344,Cartman,Eh! [a gold-colored vase pops out of his ass] 
10,7,Tsst,52348,Cartman,I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole. 
10,7,Tsst,52350,Cartman,"Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg. "
10,7,Tsst,52352,Cartman,Well he called me chubby! 
10,7,Tsst,52355,Cartman,"Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry! "
10,7,Tsst,52357,Cartman,Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true! 
10,7,Tsst,52366,Cartman,"[grabs a can of Red Bull. Several more cans are scattered around, and one of them has tipped over and spilled some drink] Mom, I need another energy drink! [tosses a can away. Next shot, he's in the tub taking a bath and farts. Next shot, he has finished off the tacos his mom served him and takes one of hers without permission.] "
10,7,Tsst,52368,Cartman,[from his days supporting Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ: pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts] 
10,7,Tsst,52371,Cartman,"Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door! "
10,7,Tsst,52373,Cartman,Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. [burps] 
10,7,Tsst,52377,Cartman,"Mom, I want a Twinkie. "
10,7,Tsst,52380,Cartman,[glances up at her] Ha! Hahahahahaha! 
10,7,Tsst,52382,Cartman,"[mocking her British accent] No thanks, I'd rather naught. "
10,7,Tsst,52384,Cartman,The hell do you think you're doing? 
10,7,Tsst,52386,Cartman,"Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch! "
10,7,Tsst,52388,Cartman,Time out? 
10,7,Tsst,52390,Cartman,[glances down and thinks] And what exactly keeps me on the stool? 
10,7,Tsst,52392,Cartman,"[looks at her, then hops off the stool] Whoa, how did I do that? [walks off to get his X-Box] "
10,7,Tsst,52394,Cartman,"Ummm, no? "
10,7,Tsst,52396,Cartman,"All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now. "
10,7,Tsst,52398,Cartman,I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move. 
10,7,Tsst,52402,Cartman,[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling. 
10,7,Tsst,52404,Cartman,Because you took my Xbox. 
10,7,Tsst,52406,Cartman,"Well, yeah. "
10,7,Tsst,52408,Cartman,Yeah. I guess so. 
10,7,Tsst,52410,Cartman,"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny. "
10,7,Tsst,52412,Cartman,"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy? "
10,7,Tsst,52414,Cartman,Why not? 
10,7,Tsst,52416,Cartman,"You're sterile, is that it? [she releases him, taken aback by that question] No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it? [her jaw drops] Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless. "
10,7,Tsst,52420,Cartman,"Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! [Stella drops him and steps back a bit] "
10,7,Tsst,52446,Cartman,"You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake. "
10,7,Tsst,52448,Cartman,Not interested in me? 
10,7,Tsst,52450,Cartman,"Yeah, well I don't see why- "
10,7,Tsst,52452,Cartman,Hey! 
10,7,Tsst,52454,Cartman,"Mom, this guy doesn't- "
10,7,Tsst,52456,Cartman,Ah! Quit it! 
10,7,Tsst,52459,Cartman,"Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can- "
10,7,Tsst,52461,Cartman,KNOCK IT OFF! 
10,7,Tsst,52465,Cartman,I'm not fat! 
10,7,Tsst,52470,Cartman,"Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch? "
10,7,Tsst,52472,Cartman,"Mom, this is degrading! "
10,7,Tsst,52474,Cartman,"Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! [begins to strain the leash, but can't get loose. He struggles to escape] "
10,7,Tsst,52476,Cartman,Maaaa. Mommm. [getting hoarse] Mommm. 
10,7,Tsst,52478,Cartman,"Mom, seriously, people are seeing me! "
10,7,Tsst,52480,Cartman,"Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now? "
10,7,Tsst,52482,Cartman,Mom! 
10,7,Tsst,52488,Cartman,[on the sofa to Liane's left] God dammit stop ignoring me! 
10,7,Tsst,52491,Cartman,"This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention! "
10,7,Tsst,52493,Cartman,"Quit it, mom! "
10,7,Tsst,52496,Cartman,"Ooo, Colonel? "
10,7,Tsst,52498,Cartman,"Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken. "
10,7,Tsst,52500,Cartman,"Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken! "
10,7,Tsst,52502,Cartman,"Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom! "
10,7,Tsst,52504,Cartman,"[to Cesar] Goddammit, I am not a dog! [turns to Liane and hops up and down like an excited dog] Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken! [gets shrill] Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! "
10,7,Tsst,52506,Cartman,"Gih- [quiets down] Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please? "
10,7,Tsst,52509,Cartman,"Suck my asshole, taco vendor! "
10,7,Tsst,52511,Cartman,"Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me! [to Liane] Now hand it over! "
10,7,Tsst,52513,Cartman,"You can't do that to me, I- "
10,7,Tsst,52515,Cartman,"Goddamnit, you just can't- "
10,7,Tsst,52517,Cartman,"Seriously! Ey? Eh... [he's now fully on his back, calm] "
10,7,Tsst,52520,Cartman,"[sits up, then stands] Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken! [Liane ignores him by looking up and away] That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine! [goes upstairs] I hate you! I'm running away! "
10,7,Tsst,52527,Cartman,"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news. [sighs as Kyle takes his turn] I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow. "
10,7,Tsst,52529,Cartman,Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street! 
10,7,Tsst,52531,Cartman,"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you. "
10,7,Tsst,52533,Cartman,"Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?! [Kenny takes his turn] His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people! [play continues] All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man. "
10,7,Tsst,52535,Cartman,"Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere! [Butters takes his turn] Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! [walks out and shuts the front door] "
10,7,Tsst,52538,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now. "
10,7,Tsst,52540,Cartman,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other. "
10,7,Tsst,52542,Cartman,"[tries to answer, but can't, so he leaves in a huff] Goddammit! [knocks on another door and Craig answers] Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets. "
10,7,Tsst,52544,Cartman,...Should that really matter at a time like this? 
10,7,Tsst,52546,Cartman,This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her. 
10,7,Tsst,52548,Cartman,"All right, I'm back. "
10,7,Tsst,52550,Cartman,"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here. "
10,7,Tsst,52552,Cartman,That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat. 
10,7,Tsst,52555,Cartman,"Aw, Goddammit! "
10,7,Tsst,52558,Cartman,What is he still doing here?! 
10,7,Tsst,52562,Cartman,"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz! "
10,7,Tsst,52564,Cartman,Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! [gets off and walks to the phone] 
10,7,Tsst,52568,Cartman,"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you! "
10,7,Tsst,52570,Cartman,"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to- "
10,7,Tsst,52572,Cartman,"Mom, knock it off! I'm not gonna stand for th- "
10,7,Tsst,52574,Cartman,Seriously! Mom- 
10,7,Tsst,52576,Cartman,Seriously! Why are you... doing this-? 
10,7,Tsst,52578,Cartman,Mom?! 
10,7,Tsst,52580,Cartman,Mom? Mom... 
10,7,Tsst,52596,Cartman,"Who does she think she is, telling me to go brush my teeth?! [despite his indignation, he looks compeled to follow orders. He gets up on the stool, gets the toothbrush, turns on the cold water, and gets the toothpaste] Jesus. What's happening to me? "
10,7,Tsst,52607,Cartman,"Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom. "
10,7,Tsst,52609,Cartman,"She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes. "
10,7,Tsst,52611,Cartman,Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out. 
10,7,Tsst,52613,Cartman,"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?! [rushes away and gets an easel with some schematics on it] All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked. [the plan includes blaming Tolkien for the murder] You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom. "
10,7,Tsst,52615,Cartman,"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face. "
10,7,Tsst,52617,Cartman,"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?! "
10,7,Tsst,52619,Cartman,"Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face. "
10,7,Tsst,52621,Cartman,Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?! [the boys ignore him. He gets pissed off and walks away with the easel] Fine! I'll do it by myself! 
10,7,Tsst,52623,Cartman,"You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son. [Liane moves a bit] You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore! [he moves the knife to a stabbing position] Goodbye, Mother. [about to deliver the fatal stab, he trembles for a few seconds, but his conscience gets a hold of him. Cartman relaxes a bit] "
10,7,Tsst,52625,Cartman,"[shakes it off] No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want! "
10,7,Tsst,52627,Cartman,She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being. 
10,7,Tsst,52629,Cartman,Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe... 
10,7,Tsst,52631,Cartman,"[hops off the bed, dropping the knife and roll of paper as he heads for the door] Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. [stops and vomits some pretty black stuff. Could be the evil in him] "
10,7,Tsst,52636,Cartman,"Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham. "
10,7,Tsst,52638,Cartman,"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started. "
10,7,Tsst,52640,Cartman,Tha... thank you? 
10,7,Tsst,52642,Cartman,"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. [the doorbell rings and Liane goes to answer the door] "
10,7,Tsst,52651,Cartman,"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. [waits a bit, then turns to go to his room. Liane turns around] "
10,7,Tsst,52653,Cartman,"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then. "
10,7,Tsst,52655,Cartman,Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52658,Cartman,"[as the dwarf, with mallet] Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52660,Cartman,"Okay, I'm back. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52662,Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52664,Cartman,"Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52666,Cartman,"Heheh, totally, heheh. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52679,Cartman,"Yeah, come on, let's go! [the four now walk abreast] I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52681,Cartman,"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half of these people are Koreans. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52685,Cartman,"Get out of here, asshole! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52690,Cartman,Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?! [the ganker begins generating power] No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard! [the ganker shoots a fireball at Cartman] No! [the fireball hits and Cartman falls face down and dies.] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52692,Cartman,That son of a bitch! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52704,Cartman,He's a God damned butthole! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52728,Cartman,"My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52732,Cartman,"We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52738,Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde! [moves around his podium to talk to Clyde more directly] If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? [beat] I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52740,Cartman,"When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52742,Cartman,"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde? (Would you like to sleep with me, Clyde?) "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52745,Cartman,"All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30. [walks up to a map of their quest] We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52748,Cartman,"Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52750,Cartman,"Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52753,Cartman,"All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52756,Cartman,"The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52759,Cartman,This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth! [another dwarf walks in looking just like Cartman's dwarf] From with- 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52761,Cartman,Butters? What the hell are you doing? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52763,Cartman,"You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52765,Cartman,"So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52769,Cartman,[turns around and leads] Then let's move out! [the others charge after him] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52772,Cartman,Everyone hold! [everyone stops in their tracks. The ganker turns around and faces them.] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52774,Cartman,"Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click! [that sends the group charging at the ganker, who responds by summoning an army of giant scorpions] What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! [the actual rogue player is shown in his apartment, leaning back on his chair and playing without needing to think very much about what to do next. His character and scorpions decimate the group] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52780,Cartman,"All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow! [Clyde's character looks like he's about to aim a crossbow] Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde! [Clyde is at his computer, but not participating in the game. He's looking at Playboy centerfolds.] Clyde! Clyde, you asshole! [rushes to join the others] Goddammit we lost Clyde! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52788,Cartman,"No, leave me alone, don't do- [the ganker stabs Cartman with his dagger through the mallet] god, dugh [Cartman dies, and the ganker skips away. Cartman furiously screams into his mic, then throws down his headset] God-fucking-dammit!!! [meanwhile, in his apartment, the ganker just keeps plugging along.] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52799,Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52801,Cartman,"Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52803,Cartman,"I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52805,Cartman,"That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52807,Cartman,There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52809,Cartman,"Yes. [whips out a sheet full of calculations] Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around, [firmly] or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52820,Cartman,"Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52841,Cartman,"All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52845,Cartman,"[begins to slur his speech ever so slightly, giving it a blasé feel] Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52847,Cartman,"Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52849,Cartman,"Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52852,Cartman,"Don't worry, I have that covered. [pressed a button on a small intercom on his desk] Mom? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52854,Cartman,More Hot Pockets! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52857,Cartman,"All right, everyone ready? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52859,Cartman,"Let's go get him! [the battle begins. The rogue is playing with the right hand, eating a cookie with the left.] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52861,Cartman,"Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52863,Cartman,Command-0. [sniffs] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52865,Cartman,"Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52867,Cartman,"Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52869,Cartman,Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52871,Cartman,Christ... 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52873,Cartman,Everyone target scorpions. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52884,Cartman,Kyle! Fire spell! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52889,Cartman,"Wait, we need Ben-Gay. [waddles to Kenny's desk desk and pulls out a tube of the stuff, then walks back and squirts some of it onto Kyle's right wrist, then rubs it in.] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52891,Cartman,I'm going as fast as I can! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52919,Cartman,"All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh... "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52921,Cartman,It's okay. [clicks on the intercom] Mom? Bathroom! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52923,Cartman,"Bathroom! Bathroom! [clicks off. A second later Liane goes into the basement with a bedpan. Cartman senses this and lowers his pants as Liane positions the bedpan in place. Cartman lets go and a log comes out first, followed by a spattering stream of crap. Some of it ends up on the floor, some of it on Liane's blouse. Nasty.] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52925,Cartman,"All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52932,Cartman,"Kyle, cast arcane missiles! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52943,Cartman,"Stan, what the hell are you doing?! [the ganker runs and leaps toward Stan and Randy] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52949,Cartman,His shield and armor spells are down! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52951,Cartman,Looks like you're about to get pwned. [swings back and then pulls the mallet forward] Heeyeah! [the mallet smashed the ganker's head into little bloody pieces.] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52965,Cartman,Yes! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52967,Cartman,Yeah! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52971,Cartman,"All right, yay. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52973,Cartman,We did it you guys. We're totally heroes. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52976,Cartman,What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52978,Cartman,"Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,52987,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,52989,Cartman,"Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53013,Cartman,"They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53015,Cartman,"Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?! "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53017,Cartman,Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53021,Cartman,"...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! [sees Butters walking towards the group] "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53023,Cartman,"Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53025,Cartman,Aha! Do you see? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53028,Cartman,I rest my case. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53031,Cartman,"That's right, Butters. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53033,Cartman,What? People see the truth? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53035,Cartman,You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media! [begins to move away from the boys] I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! [goes around a corner and disappears] 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53038,Cartman,"It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53042,Cartman,"[raises and waves his hand] Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh! "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53044,Cartman,[leaves his seat and goes to the front of the class with his laptop.] For Show and Tell today I have brought... [puts on some glasses] ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!.. [removes the glasses for dramatic effect] behind the 9/11 attacks! [the lights go out and a projector is turned on] 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53046,Cartman,"[his first image is that of the Twin Towers] We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers, [the image gets animated as a cross-section of a wall is picked apart and the steel girders shown, which led to their collapse.] which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel? [the other kids look at each other. Kyle's eyes are half-closed, showing his disinterest] We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, [a picture of the Pentagon with the damage clearly visible. A helicopter hovers nearby] but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53048,Cartman,"So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? [he begins to use his fingers to show the numbers as he says them] Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. [click. Kyle now appears superimposed on the 9/11 picture already onscreen]. Kyle! "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53050,Cartman,"Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! [clicks, and another shot of the Twin Towers is shown] When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, [he zooms in on the picture, which just becomes pixilated] but when I computer-enhanced it, [the pixilation disappears as the picture sharpens - it's a drawing of an evil Kyle with a large, sharp knife in his right hand] You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53230,Cartman,"And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53232,Cartman,"What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53234,Cartman,"Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53236,Cartman,[taunting and jabbing at him] I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53238,Cartman,Aw Goddamnit! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53241,Cartman,"[apologizes, but in a blasé fashion] I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish? "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53243,Cartman,The hall monit- me? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53246,Cartman,[incredulous] Auth- authoritah? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53248,Cartman,Ahem. Me? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53250,Cartman," There's fear and darkness all around you The criminals are on the run No use in not having your hall pass I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg The Hallway Monitor! [laughs until a hand appears and knocks on the driver's window.]   "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53252,Cartman,That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [leaves. The video shoot resumes at school. Cartman is on the job when he turns around and sees someone else in the hall. He strikes a dramatic pose and yells] Hall pass! Show me your hall pass! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53254,Cartman,"[shoves the boy into the lockers and whips out the Bear Spray] You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53256,Cartman,"[releases the boy] All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. [turns right and walks away. The boy isn't quite finished] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53258,Cartman,[kicks the boy away] Argh! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53260,Cartman,"[marches on] I am the Dawg, the big bad- [stops] Oh my God! [sees a wad of paper on the floor, runs up to pick it up and checks it out] What the fuck is this?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53263,Cartman,"[bursts into the classroom] Boyarrrgh! [everyone turns to see who it is. Cartman walks up to Ike] Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53265,Cartman,"I found this in the hallway. [unfolds the wad of paper - it's a drawing Ike made of his teacher with hearts all around her] Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you. [Ike looks around nervously] You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. [hands the drawing to the teacher and heads for the door] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53267,Cartman,"Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! [leaves and closes the door] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53279,Cartman,[bursts into the restroom. Butters is startled] Hands?! Let me see those hands! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53281,Cartman,"[advances] Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53283,Cartman,"I knew it! [...slams his head against a toilet stall, then tosses him to the floor, cuffs him, and escorts him out of the restroom. Butters doesn't get a chance to pull his pants up. The hall pass remains on the sink where Butters left it.] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53285,Cartman,"Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right? "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53287,Cartman,"Here, you need a smoke, brah? "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53289,Cartman,"You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53291,Cartman,"Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. [Butters coughs some more] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53365,Cartman,"Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright? "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53371,Cartman,"Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53373,Cartman,"What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53375,Cartman,"Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53377,Cartman,"Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53379,Cartman,They what?? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53381,Cartman,[spins around] Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53383,Cartman,"Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53388,Cartman,Hall infraction! [runs up to Miss Stevenson] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53390,Cartman,"You got a hall pass, brah?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53392,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53394,Cartman,Get down on the floor! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53396,Cartman,"[whips out the Bear Spray] You like bear mace, icehead?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53398,Cartman,You're goin' with Christ! [sprays Miss Stevenson pretty good] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53401,Cartman,"...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53403,Cartman,"Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53405,Cartman,I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53408,Cartman,"You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53417,Cartman,You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. [points his index fingers at the camera] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53436,Cartman,Oh no! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53438,Cartman,I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53474,Cartman,"There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53476,Cartman,"No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53478,Cartman,I had Beth check out their Travelocity account. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53480,Cartman,"Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53482,Cartman,"  I got some badass guys to help me. I only had to pay them fifteen bucks. You think you got away with not having a hall pass? You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg! I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg! Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again! [the video ends and the hallway looks normal again] How was that, Butters?    "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53485,Cartman,"Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! [they go forth] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53492,Cartman,Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53494,Cartman,"[determined] Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel! [into the Intercom] Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here! [Beth just signals for Earl to drive into the hotel driveway and stop at the front doors. Earl pulls up and brakes quickly] All right, let's go! Move out! [they leave the SUV and rush into the hotel] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53496,Cartman,"It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor! [they pass through the front entrance] Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53498,Cartman,"You seen this woman, brah? [shows her a picture of Miss Stevenson] She's staying here! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53500,Cartman,"I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53502,Cartman,"Beth! Bear-mace that guy! [she sprays bear mace all over the concierge and he crumbles to the floor, trying to vomit] Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53505,Cartman,"I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53507,Cartman,"[walks over to the second guest] Keep your mouth shut, brah!! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53523,Cartman,Praise Christ! Let's go! [the elderly man is convulsing from the effects of the bear mace.] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53525,Cartman,Bear mace that guy! And that guy! [Beth maces another bellboy and a guest as she and Cartman run by. Police officers round the corner and run after them] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53527,Cartman,"Freeze, bitch! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53531,Cartman,It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor. [the officers are somewhat stunned] This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53535,Cartman,"Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53548,Cartman,"[moves towards the camera] Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53550,Cartman,That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [walks towards the camera to turn it off.] 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53568,Cartman,"What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times. "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53570,Cartman,"See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. [starts imitating a hen's cluck] "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53572,Cartman,I've done it lots of times. 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53574,Cartman,"[now on the stool facing the mirror, laughs a bit] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else. "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53576,Cartman,I am not! 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53578,Cartman,[turns back to the mirror] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the door opens and Jimmy enters] 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53581,Cartman,"Oh my God. I crapped my pants. [feels his ass through his pants to be sure] You guys, I crapped my pants! [thinks, then leaves the bathroom] Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out! "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53690,Cartman,Dude... 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53697,Cartman,"You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53699,Cartman,How do you know?? 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53704,Cartman,How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him? 
10,12,Go God Go,53834,Cartman,"[under his breath] Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! [his mom arrives] "
10,12,Go God Go,53836,Cartman,I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. 
10,12,Go God Go,53838,Cartman,Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 
10,12,Go God Go,53840,Cartman,"[yanks his hand away and runs back to the store] No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand. "
10,12,Go God Go,53842,Cartman,Noo!! Nooo!! 
10,12,Go God Go,53851,Cartman,How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?! 
10,12,Go God Go,53853,Cartman,"Oh God... [shivers like someone in withdrawal] Okay, how long now? "
10,12,Go God Go,53858,Cartman,[hopping out of his chair and running out] HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH! 
10,12,Go God Go,53861,Cartman,Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! [a store clerk notices and walks over] 
10,12,Go God Go,53864,Cartman,Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer? 
10,12,Go God Go,53867,Cartman,Oh God! 
10,12,Go God Go,53869,Cartman,Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!! 
10,12,Go God Go,53871,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me. "
10,12,Go God Go,53873,Cartman,"I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me. "
10,12,Go God Go,53875,Cartman,[assertively] No. There is something I can do. 
10,12,Go God Go,53877,Cartman,"All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right? [turns around] I think I figured out how to do it. "
10,12,Go God Go,53879,Cartman,"Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me. "
10,12,Go God Go,53881,Cartman,"It's simple science, Kyle. "
10,12,Go God Go,53883,Cartman,I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!! 
10,12,Go God Go,53886,Cartman,"I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! [walks away in a huff] "
10,12,Go God Go,53944,Cartman,[in the freezer] Ey! 
10,12,Go God Go,53946,Cartman,"Close the door, I'm trying to freeze! "
10,12,Go God Go,53948,Cartman,"[resisting all of Liane's efforts] No! No, it's too soon! "
10,12,Go God Go,53951,Cartman,"Butters, get your coat. We gotta go. "
10,12,Go God Go,53953,Cartman,You're gonna help me freeze myself. 
10,12,Go God Go,53957,Cartman,"[stops and begins digging ] Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away. [finishes digging a hole, tosses the ice pick away, and prepares to step down into it] I have to be hidden. [removes his jacket and gives it to Butters] That's good. [begins to gather the snow around him and then faces Butters, who's shocked at this turn of events] And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?! "
10,12,Go God Go,53959,Cartman,"No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea "
10,12,Go God Go,53961,Cartman,"All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right? "
10,12,Go God Go,53963,Cartman,"All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed. [Butters looks at Cartman once more, then leaves. Butters turns to look at Cartman again] Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything! "
10,12,Go God Go,53965,Cartman,[all alone now] Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze. 
10,12,Go God Go,53985,Cartman,"Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do. "
10,12,Go God Go,53989,Cartman,Where am I? 
10,12,Go God Go,53991,Cartman,"Safe where, butthole?! "
10,12,Go God Go,53993,Cartman,[looks around] What?? 
10,12,Go God Go,53995,Cartman,"Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! [suddenly looks tired.] "
10,12,Go God Go,53997,Cartman,Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii? 
10,12,Go God Go,53999,Cartman,"Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe! "
10,12,Go God Go,54001,Cartman,I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii! 
10,12,Go God Go,54003,Cartman,No... [looks up at the ceiling and] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! 
10,12,Go God Go,54061,Cartman,This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. [puts his head in his hands and starts to weep. A door slides open and three of the aliens enter the room] 
10,12,Go God Go,54063,Cartman,What?? [hops onto the desk] Really?? [jumps down and exults] YES!! YES!! 
10,12,Go God Go,54065,Cartman,"So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go! "
10,12,Go God Go,54070,Cartman,I know I'm special. This isn't news to me. 
10,12,Go God Go,54072,Cartman,[strokes his chin and thinks] And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how? 
10,12,Go God Go,54074,Cartman,Who? [the medic is about to reply when something shakes the building they're in] 
10,12,Go God Go,54079,Cartman,Who are they?? 
10,12,Go God Go,54082,Cartman,Jesus Christ! 
10,12,Go God Go,54084,Cartman,I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii. 
10,12,Go God Go,54092,Cartman,What?? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54101,Cartman,"Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54103,Cartman,"[goggles now above his eyes] We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry about. [the leader's ostrich makes a noise] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54105,Cartman,Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54109,Cartman,Over here! [runs over to it] Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. [shatters the glass case protecting it and removes it] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54111,Cartman,"Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. [switches hands in holding the Wii, presses a button on his left glove and disappears] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54116,Cartman,I got it! I got the Wii! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54119,Cartman,"[turns and leaves the transporter pad] Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side. [turns around as he reaches the door] Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. [the door opens and Cartman walks into the hallway outside the room. The leader and his assistant look at each other] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54121,Cartman,[ruonds a corner] Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome! [almost walks into another UAA member] Get out of my way! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54123,Cartman,Here. [takes off the information crystal and hands it to him] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54126,Cartman,[...and enters an elevator] Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! [the doors close] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54128,Cartman,"Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54130,Cartman,There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54132,Cartman,"You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future! [starts throwing a tantrum, throwing things around] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54134,Cartman,"I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54137,Cartman,"Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54152,Cartman,"God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! [switches channels. A picture appears briefly in which a reporter is about to mention an attack, but that vanishes. Three bored kids appear seated at a coffee table] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54155,Cartman,Tell me about it. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54164,Cartman,[now interested] What? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54167,Cartman,Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54169,Cartman,"Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself. [walks forward a few steps] Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54171,Cartman,I care! Where's the closest toy store?? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54174,Cartman,Come on! Come on! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54176,Cartman,"Ugh, finally! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54178,Cartman,I want one of those time-phone things. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54180,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54182,Cartman,Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54184,Cartman,"Look, I have to have one of those phones! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54187,Cartman,How about a robot? How much for the robot? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54190,Cartman,"[turns around and walks away. K-10 follows] Science-dammit! [stops] Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records? "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54192,Cartman,I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54212,Cartman,"Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54214,Cartman,"[steps inside] Come on in, Bob. [K-10 enters the room] All right, just let me use my tools... [pulls out a gun and fires at Boy 4, who is instantly trapped in a bubble, floating in the air. K-10 does the same to Boy 5.] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54216,Cartman,[walks up and takes the time phone from the coffee table] Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! [walks out the door with K-10] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54232,Cartman,"Oh God! [throws himself back on the bed and squeezes his eyes shut. This time, the phone rings. He gets up to answer it. The caller is the Time Child] Hello? [he gets static until...] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54234,Cartman,Who is this? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54236,Cartman,What?? Who the hell is this?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54238,Cartman,Me who?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54240,Cartman,What?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54242,Cartman,"Oh very funny, Kyle! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54244,Cartman,Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54246,Cartman,"Listen to this! [puts the phone to his ass and farts into it, then slams the phone down on its base] Dickhead. [the phone rings again. Cartman picks it up and quickly slams it down again.] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54256,Cartman,"Butters?! Come on, we gotta go! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54259,Cartman,"Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54261,Cartman,What?? [enters the kitchen to talk to his future self] Who the fuck is this?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54263,Cartman,Suck my balls! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54265,Cartman,"...Okay, you have one minute. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54267,Cartman,[shocked] Are you spying on me?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54269,Cartman,"Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself! [hangs up and pulls his hood back over his head] Come on, Butters, we're going! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54309,Cartman,This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54318,Cartman,What is the Great Question? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54325,Cartman,I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54327,Cartman,Who? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54329,Cartman,Garrison? But he's an asshole. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54335,Cartman,It's an emergency! It's an emergency! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54337,Cartman,I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54339,Cartman,"Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54347,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! [Cartman's present changes again, and now he's wearing a gray suit with orange cape. Also, he's back at UAL headquarters, which is quiet and undamaged] "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54349,Cartman,[turns around] Go... Right... Where am I going? [he was facing a panel of UAL and UAA members] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54352,Cartman,Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54355,Cartman,So there is no war now in the future. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54360,Cartman,[wondering] And what was that purpose again? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54362,Cartman,Right... [a bird flies in and sets down next to him.] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54364,Cartman,"I'll miss you too, KOK-A-3. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54367,Cartman,Hoowww- [his future self is beamed into his body and he checks himself] I'm back. Wow! I'm back! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54369,Cartman,"Mom! Mom, they did it! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54371,Cartman,"[happy, for once] No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54373,Cartman,What? NO! [runs up to the window and sees that his mom is right] NOO!! [turns around and moves away from the storefront] You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54375,Cartman,I can't wait two months! [runs back to the doors] I can't! There has to be a way around this! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54377,Cartman,Hello? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54380,Cartman,"...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! [hangs up and leaves the store.] "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54675,Cartman,"Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen! I watched it on YouTube about sixty times! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54677,Cartman,"Yeah, well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Tolkien. [points at the camera. Dramatic music swells. The camera then looks at Tolkien, who's putting some books into his locker] He is gonna wanna kick your cracker teeth in. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54684,Cartman,Ohhhhhhhh? 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54686,Cartman,"Oh, shit, here we go! [gets really excited and cuts in between them, yelling] It's on! Race war! [goes back and yells at one end of the hall] Race war! Race war! [comes back again and yells at the other end of the hall] Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! [returns, just itching to see Stan and Tolkien fight] "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54689,Cartman,"[softly] Yeah, come on! Here we go! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54692,Cartman,[softly] Race war! Come on! Race war! 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54694,Cartman,"Tolkien forfeits! [takes Stan's left hand and holds it up in victory] Whites win! [lets go and twirls away] Whites win! [runs to one end of the hall] Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54727,Cartman,No! Dude! No fucking way! [laughs] Dude! [resumes laughing] 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54729,Cartman,"[shakes his head back and forth, then rears back, laughing all the while] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha... "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54732,Cartman,"Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. [resumes laughing. Mr. Nelson gets pissed off, but holds it in] "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54758,Cartman,[stops long enough to respond] Oh. Did I hurt its little feelings? [resumes laughing] 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54760,Cartman,"[before Mr. Nelson finishes talking] Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! [stomps his foot on the floor, points to Mr. Nelson, and laughs. Principal Victoria buries her face in her hands] "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54762,Cartman,[stops] Barely! [starts up again] 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54764,Cartman,"[stops] ""Rise above it!"" Get it? [starts up again] "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54768,Cartman,"Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54782,Cartman,"Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?! [walks up to Kyle accusingly] Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?! [Mr. Nelson walks out towards the entrance, then curves around to stand behind Cartman] I bet you did! What the hell is going on?! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54784,Cartman,"Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54843,Cartman,"It's a midget, dude. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54845,Cartman,"Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. [the kids urge them to fight, and the match begins] "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54870,Cartman,"Say ""Uncle!"" "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54872,Cartman,"Hahaha, now say ""Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"" "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54874,Cartman,"Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical! [Mr. Nelson rises and pummels him in the back of the head. Cartman falls forward] Oh! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54887,Cartman,"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads ""THE PIERRE 3/10/07."" Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"". [caresses the picture] I really like how the light plays with the background on this one. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54889,Cartman,"Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here. [last shot looks faded, with Cartman's ass directly on Butters' face.] But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54891,Cartman,"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to- "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54893,Cartman,"Heh! [quickly puts away his scrapbook] Oh, oh hey, Butters! [turns around and greets him] I wasn't expecting you so soon. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54895,Cartman,"[returns] No no, these guys were just leaving. [faces the other guys menacingly] Weren't you guys? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54900,Cartman,Kyyyle! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54903,Cartman,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54907,Cartman,"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54909,Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54911,Cartman,[off screen] You guys! I got it! [runs in and joins them] It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54913,Cartman,"It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54915,Cartman,"I know I know, check it out, look. [the other three crowd in and look at the picture] I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54917,Cartman,Because that makes Butters gay now! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54919,Cartman,Eh- ...what? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54921,Cartman,[looks more closely at the picture] Nuh uh. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54923,Cartman,"Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54925,Cartman,"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54927,Cartman,"No, no, it was a stupid mistake! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54929,Cartman,"No, it was just for a second! [seeing that his plan has backfired, he puts the picture away] What, what can I do? How-how can I reverse this? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54932,Cartman,How? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54934,Cartman,[low voice] Really? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54936,Cartman,"[beat] ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! [runs off] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54940,Cartman,[enters the room] Butters. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54942,Cartman,"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54944,Cartman,It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54946,Cartman,You ready? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54948,Cartman,"Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54950,Cartman,Hang on a second here. [makes sure the blindfold is on snugly] 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54952,Cartman,"'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? [rushes off to get the toybox] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54954,Cartman,"[under his breath] All right, that's good. [undoes his pants] Okay, open your mouth, Butters? [lowers them and ...] That's good, just like that. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54956,Cartman,"...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. [lifts up his shirt to show his massive gut] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54958,Cartman,"All right, you ready? [grabs Butters' head and draws it closer to his own wiener] All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. [at that moment the door opens and Stephen enters.] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54960,Cartman,Uh! [quickly gets dressed up] 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54985,Cartman,Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54987,Cartman,"[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54989,Cartman,"[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. [pleased with himself] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54991,Cartman,"Right, except for you. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54993,Cartman,[turns around] Why would you tell anybody? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54995,Cartman,"...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54997,Cartman,"Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch. [grins, but Stan and Kyle ignore him] Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! [chuckles] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54999,Cartman,"[angrily] Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55001,Cartman,"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys! [the other boys continue playing. Cartman changes tactics: he pleads] You guys, please don't tell anybody. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55003,Cartman,"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle. [turns around and cackles] Haha, hahahaha! [leaves the house] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55022,Cartman,"Where is it, you filthy Jew?! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55024,Cartman,[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55027,Cartman,"I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55029,Cartman,"[rolls up his sleeves] Give it back, Kyle! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55031,Cartman,"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now, [puts up his fists as if to box] I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55033,Cartman,"You shut up! You're lying, and [points an accusing finger at Stan and Kenny] you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews! [Kyle punches him on the right arm once, firmly] OW! [puts his left hand over his right arm] OW! AAAAUH! [grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55043,Cartman,Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55045,Cartman,"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55047,Cartman,[long pause] Why... why does that matter? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55049,Cartman,All right. It's a picture ...of me. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55051,Cartman,It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55053,Cartman,"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55055,Cartman,"Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55057,Cartman,I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55074,Cartman,That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55077,Cartman,"[crying throughout] I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55079,Cartman,"Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55081,Cartman,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55083,Cartman,"[sniffles] Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55085,Cartman,"But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay! [turns his face to the wall and cries again] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55087,Cartman,"[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee! [turns to her and cries into her chest] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55089,Cartman,"You, you will? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55114,Cartman,It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her] 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55116,Cartman,[his smile vanishes] What? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55118,Cartman,"Mom, she's lying! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55120,Cartman,"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55122,Cartman,[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55142,Cartman,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55146,Cartman,"HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55148,Cartman,And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to] 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55167,Cartman,And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps] 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55170,Cartman,Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55172,Cartman,"What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that- "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55174,Cartman,[longer pause] ...Lame. 
11,3,Lice Capades,55177,Cartman,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem. [points to Kyle, but blocks Kyle's view of his left hand with his right.] Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55182,Cartman,Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny. 
11,3,Lice Capades,55197,Cartman,"[answering] They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. [Butters gasps] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55199,Cartman,This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home. 
11,3,Lice Capades,55264,Cartman,"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened? "
11,3,Lice Capades,55271,Cartman,"Well who was it? [points to Kenny] It was Kenny, right? "
11,3,Lice Capades,55273,Cartman,"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who! [points to Kenny again] It was Kenny, wasn't it? "
11,3,Lice Capades,55276,Cartman,[pounds on his desk] That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55294,Cartman,"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! [Opposite Cartman are Jimmy, Tweek, Clyde, Anne, Bebe, Red. and two other kids. With Cartman are Craig, Tolkien, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Kevin, Butters, and Wendy] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55296,Cartman,"Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55298,Cartman,Me?! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55300,Cartman,"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55302,Cartman,"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. [Stan is stunned] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55304,Cartman,And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face] 
11,3,Lice Capades,55309,Cartman,There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! [turns left and walks away. Clyde looks around] 
11,3,Lice Capades,55331,Cartman,"All right, lock that door, Craig! [Craig goes to lock the door] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55333,Cartman,"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice. [whips out a little propane torch from his right pocket] We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties. [whips out a lighter from his left pocket, strikes the lighter on, and uses the lighter to light the torch. He puts the lighter away. Clyde is scared now.] Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55336,Cartman,"[figuring out how to respond] This is a scientific test, designed to- "
11,3,Lice Capades,55338,Cartman,"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55340,Cartman,"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55345,Cartman,Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you. 
11,3,Lice Capades,55347,Cartman,"All right, now everyone back over there! [the boys head back to the bench] We'll start with what I already know. [moves the heated coil tip over the blood sample. Only steam comes from it] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55350,Cartman,"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle! [takes Kyle's Petri dish and ...the same thing happens] Huh, I guess you're clean. [tries another Petri dish] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55352,Cartman,"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! [sticks the tip into the Petri dish, causing the blood to heat up and jump out of the dish. He gets the blood all over himself, and for good measure, tosses the rest of the blood onto himself.] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55354,Cartman,Kenny! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55357,Cartman,"Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! [silence for a second or two, then Kenny bolts for the door, pushing Craig aside, opening the door, and running down the hall] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55375,Cartman,"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen. [beat] Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! [they turn and head off] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55377,Cartman,"What, Clyde? "
11,3,Lice Capades,55379,Cartman,"All right, see you there! [the guys turn around and leave] Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55404,Cartman,"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55406,Cartman,"Guilty! I thought so! [the boys pull down his hood and coat, and his shirt] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55409,Cartman,"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! [the boys gang up on Kenny and give him the sock bath] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55419,Cartman,"Oh I get it. [walks up to Stan and Kyle] This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55421,Cartman,Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55425,Cartman,"But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! [the other boys join in the chant ""Sock bath!"" and gang up on Kenny once again] "
11,4,The Snuke,55435,Cartman,"Uh oh! [Kyle's seat is empty, and he fears the worst] "
11,4,The Snuke,55438,Cartman,"Duhude, dude, [throws out his arms, palms out] not cool! "
11,4,The Snuke,55441,Cartman,"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo. "
11,4,The Snuke,55443,Cartman,"What's wrong? [looks at Baahir, who's looking back at him, then looks back at Mrs. Garrison and takes her aside] Has he been checked for bombs? "
11,4,The Snuke,55445,Cartman,"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them. "
11,4,The Snuke,55450,Cartman,"[hushed] Kyle, are you on your computer? "
11,4,The Snuke,55452,Cartman,Get online. I need you to check something for me. 
11,4,The Snuke,55454,Cartman,"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger! "
11,4,The Snuke,55456,Cartman,Get online now! 
11,4,The Snuke,55458,Cartman,Go to MySpace. [enters the school building] See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem. 
11,4,The Snuke,55460,Cartman,"[begins walking down the hallway] Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have? "
11,4,The Snuke,55462,Cartman,[walks further along] Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band? 
11,4,The Snuke,55464,Cartman,[stops suddenly] That's funny. 
11,4,The Snuke,55466,Cartman,He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182. 
11,4,The Snuke,55468,Cartman,[voiceover] The following takes place between Recess and Geography class. 
11,4,The Snuke,55471,Cartman,"[entering the boys' restroom, still in hushed tones] Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! [checks the toilet stalls on all fours] "
11,4,The Snuke,55473,Cartman,I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now! 
11,4,The Snuke,55475,Cartman,"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this? "
11,4,The Snuke,55477,Cartman,"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect. "
11,4,The Snuke,55487,Cartman,[exits the building through a side door and answers the call] Yeah. [walks among various trash cans and bins] 
11,4,The Snuke,55489,Cartman,Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?! 
11,4,The Snuke,55491,Cartman,Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow! 
11,4,The Snuke,55493,Cartman,"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion. [starts running] Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce! "
11,4,The Snuke,55495,Cartman,Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?! 
11,4,The Snuke,55497,Cartman,[stops] What? 
11,4,The Snuke,55502,Cartman,"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park! "
11,4,The Snuke,55504,Cartman,He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away! 
11,4,The Snuke,55506,Cartman,I said I will only talk to the President! 
11,4,The Snuke,55508,Cartman,LALALALALALALALA! 
11,4,The Snuke,55510,Cartman,LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA! 
11,4,The Snuke,55514,Cartman,"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line? "
11,4,The Snuke,55516,Cartman,"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now! "
11,4,The Snuke,55538,Cartman,"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid! "
11,4,The Snuke,55540,Cartman,"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address? "
11,4,The Snuke,55542,Cartman,"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready? "
11,4,The Snuke,55544,Cartman,It's my balls! [laughs as Kyle just looks at the image] 
11,4,The Snuke,55546,Cartman,"[his laugh dies down, then] Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here. "
11,4,The Snuke,55588,Cartman,[gets the call] Yeah? [walks through a parking lot] 
11,4,The Snuke,55590,Cartman,"Yes, Mr. Thompson? "
11,4,The Snuke,55592,Cartman,Why? Did you find something? 
11,4,The Snuke,55594,Cartman,[stops] A snuke? 
11,4,The Snuke,55596,Cartman,"[""[walks again] I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now where are you? ""]"
11,4,The Snuke,55598,Cartman,"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. [the framing for the two scenes is removed to reveal the one image of Cartman standing next to the CIA agents. They look at each other] "
11,4,The Snuke,55612,Cartman,Big surprise! 
11,4,The Snuke,55628,Cartman,Let me have time with him. 
11,4,The Snuke,55630,Cartman,We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him! [removes his cap and goes in] You will tell me where your son is! 
11,4,The Snuke,55632,Cartman,[farts] Where is the detonator?! 
11,4,The Snuke,55634,Cartman,"[farts some more, and again, and again] I can do this aaall day. "
11,4,The Snuke,55636,Cartman,You can make it stop! 
11,4,The Snuke,55659,Cartman,Nothing... if you tell me where your son is! 
11,4,The Snuke,55661,Cartman,"[whips around and shows them the syringe] Do you know what this is?! [they look at each other, unsure] This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. [injects himself with the syringe into the right arm and hops up on the stool next to Mrs. Hakeem] "
11,4,The Snuke,55663,Cartman,Where is your son?! 
11,4,The Snuke,55667,Cartman,Answer it! [holds the phone to Mrs. Hakeem's right ear] 
11,4,The Snuke,55669,Cartman,Butters. 
11,4,The Snuke,55672,Cartman,We got him! I know where he is! 
11,4,The Snuke,55674,Cartman,"No no, he's my lead. [opens the suitcase] "
11,4,The Snuke,55676,Cartman,You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! [gives himself a double injection of apple juice] 
11,4,The Snuke,55694,Cartman,"Uuugh! [lies motionless for a few seconds, then gets up] "
11,4,The Snuke,55696,Cartman,[walks up to Baahir and grabs him by the collar] Where is the detonator! 
11,4,The Snuke,55698,Cartman,You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One! 
11,4,The Snuke,55702,Cartman,"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! [A black van pulls up next to them and the side door slides open. Three real terrorists jump out and aim their semiautomatics at the two boys] "
11,4,The Snuke,55704,Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore. "
11,4,The Snuke,55711,Cartman,Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy! 
11,4,The Snuke,55713,Cartman,That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading. 
11,4,The Snuke,55715,Cartman,"Uhh yes, of course? "
11,4,The Snuke,55717,Cartman,The Russians? 
11,4,The Snuke,55719,Cartman,The Germans? 
11,4,The Snuke,55721,Cartman,The Germans again? 
11,4,The Snuke,55723,Cartman,You can't possible mean...? 
11,4,The Snuke,55782,Cartman,"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology. "
11,4,The Snuke,55784,Cartman,"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool. "
11,4,The Snuke,55786,Cartman,"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right? "
11,4,The Snuke,55788,Cartman,"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America. "
11,4,The Snuke,55790,Cartman,"Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?! "
11,4,The Snuke,55792,Cartman,"Yes or no, Kyle?! "
11,4,The Snuke,55794,Cartman,"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? [Baahir's parents approach, looking around at all the activity in front of their house] "
11,4,The Snuke,55797,Cartman,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh? [raises his own hand] That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice. "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55817,Cartman,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?! "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55819,Cartman,"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you! "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55821,Cartman,"Bye, Easter bunny! [leaves] "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56069,Cartman,Have you lost your mind? 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56078,Cartman,"You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56080,Cartman,No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things. 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56082,Cartman,¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? ¿Sí? ¿Trabajo? 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56085,Cartman,"[holds his arms out in open embrace] Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read [whips out the book from his back pocket] The Old Man and the Sea for us. ¿Comprende? E Old Mand Y La Mer. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56090,Cartman,"Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56094,Cartman,"Okay, gracias. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56097,Cartman,"Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56142,Cartman,"They'll be done. [whistles to get the laborers' attention.] ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? [the laborers approach] All right, did you read the book? "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56152,Cartman,"All right, did you write the four essays? "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56155,Cartman,"Okay, let's have 'em. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56163,Cartman,Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?! 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56173,Cartman,Crap! [the boys head for their seats] 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56176,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56184,Cartman,That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56347,Cartman,"All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56351,Cartman,"[pinches his nose shut] Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house. [releases the pinch] Get out of here! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56355,Cartman,"No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56357,Cartman,"Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56360,Cartman,"Thank you, thank you. [to Stan and Kenny] The ramp ready? "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56364,Cartman,"All right, here we go! Jimmy? [Jimmy starts the drum roll. Cartman takes off and picks up speed on his way to the ramp. Tweek and Bebe have their fists ready to pump for him. He leaves the ramp successfully, only to land on the bum and hit the ground without injury] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56366,Cartman,[jumps off his skateboard] Yes! I did it! [tosses his helmet away] I jumped over the homeless! [turns around] Yes! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56394,Cartman,There's a bunch outside my house too. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56396,Cartman,No! Fuck off! [slams the door shut] 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56399,Cartman,Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56401,Cartman,You what?! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56404,Cartman,"[makes his way to Kyle] Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56444,Cartman,"You see what you did, Kyle?! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56447,Cartman,They're everywhere! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56458,Cartman,"[pinching his nose shut with his left hand as he fans the smell away with his right] Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56460,Cartman,"Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56483,Cartman,"All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56485,Cartman,"I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56487,Cartman,I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56521,Cartman,Cool. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56527,Cartman,"Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56571,Cartman,Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56574,Cartman,Youu heard about that? 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56576,Cartman,Thirty was hard enough. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56579,Cartman,"Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56617,Cartman,Let's hope to Christ this works. [prepares to press the red button. Music begins to play] 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56620,Cartman, Is nice to the homeless Californiania Supercool to the homeless   
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56622,Cartman, City of Santa Monica Lots of rich people giving change to the homeless

11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56641,Cartman,"[jumps off his skateboard, throws down his helmet and exults] Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! [faces his friends and the bums] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56644,Cartman,[picks out a figure] Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip. [moves the package around with his left hand and strokes his chin with his right] That's pretty kewl. Let's see... 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56646,Cartman,[puts the Slammer back on the rack and selects another figure.] The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck- 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56657,Cartman,"[turns around and walks off, saying softly] Dude, that mom is kewl. [he arrives at the checkout line with his action figure] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56659,Cartman,[turns around and glares at Thomas] Are you talkin' to me?! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56661,Cartman,"What's your problem, kid?! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56663,Cartman,What? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56667,Cartman,[waves his arms around] Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56673,Cartman,"[turns around and faces the crowd] All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56676,Cartman,Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance] haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. [throws his action figure into the air and runs out the door] 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56678,Cartman,I don't need the toy! I've found something better! [dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56681,Cartman,Puh- pussy! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56683,Cartman,Pussy! Cock! Shit! [covers his mouth in faking embarrassment] 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56685,Cartman,"Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! [covers his mouth immediately] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56687,Cartman,...Cocksucker! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56689,Cartman,"Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56692,Cartman,"But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56694,Cartman,"Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56696,Cartman,"Shit! Butthole! [walks up to Wendy] Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry. [smiles and moves on] Titties! Cock! [he's relishing this. He points to a redhead] Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56698,Cartman,"Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56704,Cartman,"[deciding to explain things. Mr. Mackey is in the background] Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole! [the other kids lean away] Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56707,Cartman,"[his thunder is stolen and he covers for it] Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle? [walks to Kyle] Asscheeks! [hauls Kyle off to a clearing] Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56709,Cartman,"...Oh, okay, you figured me out. [claps] Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56711,Cartman,"Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56713,Cartman,"Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! [Mr. Mackey does nothing but walk away] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56717,Cartman,Dicktits! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56719,Cartman,"Shit! Asshole! [Mrs. Garrison looks at Cartman with a bit of shock, then turns to the board.] 'Scuse me. [Cartman smiles] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56721,Cartman,"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch! [the class laughs. Cartman pretends to be hurt] You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56723,Cartman,Tampon! Tampon DICKshit! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56725,Cartman,"Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56734,Cartman,Kyle please! I'm sorry! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56739,Cartman,"That's right, Kyle. [turns his head to the left, where Kyle happens to be] Crap-filled vagina! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56767,Cartman,"Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56769,Cartman,"You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56771,Cartman,"Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother. [looks at Gerald and Sheila] Fag Jew! Jew bitch! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56773,Cartman,Thank you. Big-nosed kike! [Sheila laughs nervously] 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56775,Cartman,"Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face! [thumps his chest and clears his throat] Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one. [starts to walk away] Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works. [stops to whisper to Thomas] Isn't having Tourette's awesome? [leaves] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56786,Cartman,"[doing a voice-over]  Dear Mr. Hansen,  I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!!  Eric Cartman   [he doesn't say his name]  "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56789,Cartman,"[adding to the commercial] Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true. [jumps at the camera] Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! [jumps back in shock, covers his mouth, then smiles at the camera sweetly, bending his head to the right] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56792,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Dickhead! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56794,Cartman,"[serves himself some liquid] Yes. It's all finally come to fruition. [gently swirls the ice around] The final cog in my... master plan. [turns around to face Kyle] This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air. [turns back and prepares a drink for Kyle] Despicable things. And people will call me brave. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56796,Cartman,[takes the drink to Kyle] Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56798,Cartman,"[quickly gives him the drink in triumph] Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56800,Cartman,"Then the game is on, Kyle. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56802,Cartman,"[walks back to make another ""Scotch""] Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" [realizes what just happened] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56804,Cartman,Uhh nuh-nothing... 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56806,Cartman,Hm. That was... weird. 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56810,Cartman,"[Mr. Donaldson adjusts the mic to his height] Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls! [applause rises from the crowd] You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. [applause rises from the crowd] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56812,Cartman,"And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up! [startled by his own words, then covers his mouth as the crowd falls silent.] Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad. [turns away from the mic and mumbles] What the hell is going on? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56814,Cartman,"No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh, [helplessly] I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! [covers his mouth] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56816,Cartman,"[clambors offstage] Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! [runs through the crowd] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56819,Cartman,"[finishes up and looks at Butters] Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56821,Cartman,"Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners. [he covers his mouth in horror as Butters is stunned] Wah! [faces Butters] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56823,Cartman,I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! [runs out of the restroom] 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56825,Cartman,"Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56827,Cartman,"[turns around and faces her] No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's [struggles to keep control] AAAA no, NAAAA! [he's got the crowd's attention] I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year. [now composed] Ah, I need to be going now. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56829,Cartman,[apprehensive] Dateline. Right. [backs away but can't control his statements] I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! [runs out the door screaming with his hands firmly over his mouth] 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56832,Cartman,"[rushes onto the set] Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56834,Cartman,"My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56836,Cartman,No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show. 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56838,Cartman,[heads for the door] But I'm not gonna do the- 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56840,Cartman,"I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56842,Cartman,"You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56844,Cartman,"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad. [gets his cap and puts it on] So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. [hops off the stool and walks away] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56846,Cartman,"Oh, I don't wanna take a seat! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56848,Cartman,"[begins backing up] No, I'm just gonna go- [wonders how this is happening] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56850,Cartman,[gets back on the stool and whispers to himself] How does he do that? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56857,Cartman,"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this? [walks to a nearby table and begins to pray] God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!"" [covers his mouth quickly] Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56878,Cartman,Kyle? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56880,Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56906,Cartman,Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56908,Cartman,"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56910,Cartman,"You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say! [heads up the aisle and out of the studio] I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! [Kyle is alone on set, but Thomas comes up and stands next to him] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57159,Cartman,"All right, let's try over here. [points straight ahead. Jason appears behind them] Set up traps there, and there as well. [points right] Last time I saw him he ran right through here. [moves, revealing Stan further back. Cartman moves to his left, and Kyle is seen sitting on a fallen tree] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57161,Cartman,"[sets up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57163,Cartman,"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. [Tweek joins Stan in the background] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57165,Cartman,"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?! [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57167,Cartman,"Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire.] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57169,Cartman,"Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57171,Cartman,"[whispers loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57173,Cartman,"Faggot, I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57176,Cartman,"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57179,Cartman,"[to Tolkien] Set off diversion track C! [Tolkien sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57182,Cartman,"[charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and all the boys except Kyle, who is dumbfounded, give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! [the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in.] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57188,Cartman,"[making his way through, out of breath] Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57190,Cartman,"[gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheathes it] Slow! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57194,Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle and clears his throat] Kyle, suck my balls. [brings out the contract both of them signed. Kyle stands motionless] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57202,Cartman,"[walks in with the contract and a camera] Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57204,Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57206,Cartman,"Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57209,Cartman,"We had a deal, Kyle! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57211,Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] You signed an agreement, Kyle!! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57214,Cartman,"Thank you, Mr. Broflovski. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57218,Cartman,"And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57294,Cartman,"[as the plaintiff, with a lawyer] I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt. [Kyle is the defendant, without a laywer] A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls! [the judge can't believe what she's hearing] I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57300,Cartman,[pumps his left fist] Yesss! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57302,Cartman,"Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57347,Cartman,"Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57349,Cartman,He has to. He's been ordered by the court. 
11,10,Imaginationland,57351,Cartman,"What? Move aside, move aside! [moves through the crowd to the door] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57354,Cartman,"Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57356,Cartman,"Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! [the sound of helicopters ruins the moment as Cartman's smile vanishes and he looks around. Stan and Kyle turn around and see the helicopters. Police cars and government vehicles converge on Cartman's house as the copters land. General Deckter, specialist, two soldiers, and two security guards pour out of the helicopter] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57361,Cartman,"[runs up and grabs Kyle's free hand] Hey, let go of him! [Kyle is now in a tug of war between Cartman and General Deckter] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57363,Cartman,"No! No, he has to suck my balls! [loses his hold on Kyle and falls to the sidewalk on all fours. He gets up and runs after the helicopter, which takes off quickly. All the other vehicles pull out. Cartman runs down the street a bit] NO! KYYYYLE! [loses his turban] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57374,Cartman,"Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57376,Cartman,"I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice... [looks at a picture of Kyle] is the justice you take. [to the picture] Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. [runs his finger over Kyle's mouth] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57378,Cartman,[voiceover] Previously on Battlestar Galactica [clips from last week's episode follow] 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57430,Cartman,"[voiceover] Every night, the dream is the same. [a field of grain pops up with purple mountains in the background. Cartman walks in smiling and holding the contract] I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls. [Kyle is standing in the field, and Cartman walks up to him] And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle."" [Kyle's name echoes into the distance] But then... [Kyle turns around with his mouth sewn shut] ""NO! NOOO!"" [Cartman rises into the air and the field fades to black] It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. [he floats through the darkness, completely naked. His right testicle pops and dissolves into the air, triggering him to moan in agony. His left one does the same, and there's no penis left either.] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57431,Cartman,(echoing) Aaaaahhhh... 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57434,Cartman,NO! I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time. 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57488,Cartman,"Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57490,Cartman,"Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57532,Cartman,"[gets up quickly and marches towards Kyle] Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57534,Cartman,"That kid you have made a bet that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57536,Cartman,[some guards seize him and begin to drag him away] No! Hold on a second! [they stop and let him go] I have a contract [holds it out] validated by the United States court system! 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57544,Cartman,Theee conference room is which way? [smiles] 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57546,Cartman,"Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57548,Cartman,"Well we're here now, that's all that matters. [brings up a small cup of mixed nuts] Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57550,Cartman,"[cuts him off with a loud yawn and hops off his chair] Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle. [walks towards a tripod and sets a camera on it] It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57552,Cartman,"Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle. [starts unzipping a duffle bag] I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. [pulls out a purple robe] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57554,Cartman,"[puts on the robe] Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do. [pulls out a crown and turns to face Kyle] By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are... [puts on the crown] extra vinegary... "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57581,Cartman,I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57583,Cartman,"No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus. [sets the depth] There we go. [smiles, then returns to his seat] Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth? "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57585,Cartman,"In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- [a red alert interrupts him] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57587,Cartman,"Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57589,Cartman,"No! Goddammit, no! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57638,Cartman,No! Kyle can't die. [gets on his knees and checks various parts of his body for a pulse] 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57640,Cartman,Kyle? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57642,Cartman,"[enraged] NNNOOO! [begins giving Kyle CPR] No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57644,Cartman,[to the paramedic] Zap him again! [opens Kyle's coat and shirt for better contact] Do it! 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57646,Cartman,DO IT! [the paramedic places the paddles back on Kyle's body] Come on buddy. 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57648,Cartman,"Come on buddy. [the paramedic fires away. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet.] Get out of here! [goes back to giving Kyle CPR. A woman covers her eyes in despair] Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight! [smacks Kyle around] Fight! Fight! Right now! [begins to break down] Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight! [pounds Kyle's chest hard] Fight! [Kyle coughs, then comes to. Cartman begins to weep happily.] Give him some air. [an oxygen mask appears and Cartman places it over Kyle's nose and mouth.] There, easy. Breathe easy. [weeps softly some more] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57661,Cartman,"Wake up, Kyle. [Kyle wakes up to a smiling Cartman] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57680,Cartman,"[comes in smiling with a covered platter on a food cart] Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57682,Cartman,"What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57684,Cartman,"[smiles] You just rest, Kyle. [takes the lid off the platter] Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry- [suddenly pondering] but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle? [taps his chin] What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream, [real softly] let's see "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57686,Cartman,"Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle? [turns towards the sundae] What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right! [faces Kyle with a determined face] My balls! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57688,Cartman,"Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now. [takes off his cap and begins to pull out yet another costume] So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57690,Cartman,"[now in papal robes] Don't try to change the subject, Kyle. [puts on the papal tiara and pulls the camera and its tripod into place] You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. [closes his eyes and smiles] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57712,Cartman,"Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57753,Cartman,How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57760,Cartman,...What? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57768,Cartman,Where are you going?! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57770,Cartman,"Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57772,Cartman,[follows him out and watches him walk away] We had a DEAL KYLE! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57774,Cartman,"IT ISN'T OVER!! [Kyle turns to face him] It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57829,Cartman,[gets up] What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57831,Cartman,You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57842,Cartman,"Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57849,Cartman,"[two guards haul him away] No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57888,Cartman,"Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57894,Cartman,Kyle? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57902,Cartman,"So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. [gloats] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57922,Cartman,"You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality. [he begins to think hard, and an imaginary version of himself appears, wearing the crown and robe from before.] Why look, it's me. And... [thinks again, and an imaginary Kyle appears] And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? [the imaginary Kyle drops out of view] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57924,Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! [the imaginary Cartman is a little shocked] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57927,Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57929,Cartman,"No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57931,Cartman,"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. [everyone but Kyle laughs] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57948,Cartman,"Stan, you guys are good! [Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing. The score is 15,594 points and climbs quickly. Randy watches from the kitchen doorway] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57965,Cartman,"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57968,Cartman,Real guitars are for old people. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57977,Cartman,"[so relaxed his fat blocks his chin from view] Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58062,Cartman,Oh my God this is so awesome. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58131,Cartman,"All right, Stan, you've got it, man! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58138,Cartman,"Come on guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys leave, as to the couples and other spectators, leaving Stan alone with Mr. Kincade. Mr. Hart approaches Mr. Kincade.] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58191,Cartman,"Stop cheating, Craig! [pushes Craig from behind] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58193,Cartman,"'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58195,Cartman,What? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58205,Cartman,"Butters, you wanna play me next? [picks up Stan's controller and puts it on] "
11,14,The List,58215,Cartman,[mad] They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look? 
11,14,The List,58219,Cartman,"[with a double cheeseburger in his left hand] Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about. "
11,14,The List,58221,Cartman,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you! "
11,14,The List,58223,Cartman,"No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor. "
11,14,The List,58225,Cartman,"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married. "
11,14,The List,58229,Cartman,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list. "
11,14,The List,58231,Cartman,"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class! "
11,14,The List,58233,Cartman,"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him? "
11,14,The List,58237,Cartman,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them. "
11,14,The List,58239,Cartman,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her. [points to a chalkboard with his plan on it] This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"". [a map with routes of the plan laid out] "
11,14,The List,58241,Cartman,"At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here. [upper center part of the map] When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls. "
11,14,The List,58243,Cartman,"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good? "
11,14,The List,58246,Cartman,"Bail, bail! [he and Kenny take off] "
11,14,The List,58248,Cartman,"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls. "
11,14,The List,58250,Cartman,"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time"". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground. "
11,14,The List,58252,Cartman,"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! [continues] "
11,14,The List,58254,Cartman,We got it! We got it! [next shot is of Stan at his locker as Craig runs by] 
11,14,The List,58257,Cartman,"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! [Kyle is washing his hands, but he turns to see what's going on] "
11,14,The List,58269,Cartman,What?! That's bullcrap! [Kenny moves up past Cartman and looks for his name. He finds himself at #7] 
11,14,The List,58272,Cartman,"You're last, dude! [laughs heartily] "
11,14,The List,58274,Cartman,Yes way! Check it out! [laughs heartily] 
11,14,The List,58276,Cartman,So? I'm hotter than Kyle. [makes his way through the crowd and out of the bathroom] I'm better looking than Kyyyle! [the other boys join him out except for Stan and Kyle] Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! 
11,14,The List,58300,Cartman,"I'm better looking than you! [knocks on the window again] The girls think I'm better looking than you, Kyle! [Kyle sighs, stands on his bed, and pulls on a drawstring to close the curtains. Cartman moves with the curtain until he can no longer see inside Kyle's room] Dude, Kyle! Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are! [knocks] Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive! [knocks again. The curtain is fully closed and Kyle goes back to sleep] Kyle? "
11,14,The List,58315,Cartman,"[walks up] Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right? [Kyle stays mum, as before] Cool. [walks away. A few seconds later, Kyle's eyes pop open] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58464,Cartman,AHHHHHH. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58466,Cartman,What? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58469,Cartman,"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58471,Cartman,"No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58473,Cartman,...Ice cream? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58476,Cartman,Well...you did say free ice cream? [Dentist and Liane laugh] 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58479,Cartman,"[Opening his eyes, blinking a lot] Uh. It's over? "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58481,Cartman,"[Eyes fully open, sitting up] Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58483,Cartman,"All right, so where's my ice cream? "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58486,Cartman,"You were right, doctor! Everything is okay! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58489,Cartman,What's that supposed to mean?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58491,Cartman,I HAVE AIDS? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58493,Cartman,"""Sorry""?! You gave me AIDS and you're ""sorry""?! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58495,Cartman,"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58497,Cartman,"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58499,Cartman,[Knocks the ice cream on the ground] Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58501,Cartman,NO! NOOOOOOOO! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58517,Cartman,"God damn it, this sucks ass! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58520,Cartman,"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58522,Cartman,"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58526,Cartman,Where the hell is everybody? [a waitress arrives with some food] 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58531,Cartman,So this is it? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58533,Cartman,"Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58535,Cartman,Just bring out Elton John already! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58538,Cartman,Jimmy Buffett?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58540,Cartman,Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58542,Cartman,"[sticks his middle finger up in the air] Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58544,Cartman,"Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58546,Cartman,"Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58548,Cartman,"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58550,Cartman,"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead. [Kyle bursts out laughing; Cartman angrily approaches him] OH YEAH, it'S REAL FUCKIN' FUNNY, KYLE! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58552,Cartman,NO YOU DON'T! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58554,Cartman,"If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! [the smirk is having trouble not breaking into a laugh] Well any goddamned second, Kyle! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58556,Cartman,"[watched Kyle leave] Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58558,Cartman,Ironic how? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58560,Cartman,"[spins around and gets in Stan's face] Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58562,Cartman,"[advances] Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58565,Cartman,"[comes into view also dressed as a cat burglar] All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. [they head towards the sliding door] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58567,Cartman,"Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58569,Cartman,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58571,Cartman,"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58573,Cartman,"[gets down to business] All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58575,Cartman,"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times. [moments later, Cartman is shown moving up along the outer wall to Kyle's window. He stops and opens the window gingerly, silently steps onto Kyle's bed, and walks over to Kyle's face. Then he whispers] You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well... [reaches into his back pack, pulls out a syringe, rolls up the sleeves on his left arm and...] let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. [...draws some blood into it and drops the blood into Kyle's mouth. Kyle instinctively tastes it and swallows it. Cartman quickly goes back out the window and slams it shut as Kyle wakes up.] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58595,Cartman,"Pass me the ball! [Kyle angrily runs in from a distance...] Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole! [...and shoves Cartman to the ground forward at full speed. Cartman falls on his face, then looks back and up at Kyle.] Kyle, what the F?! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58597,Cartman,"Kyle, what?! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58601,Cartman,"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it? "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58603,Cartman,Nothing! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58605,Cartman,"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. [too late. Butters stops motioning] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58607,Cartman,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p- "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58609,Cartman,Kyle! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58618,Cartman,Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58620,Cartman,[grudgingly] Kind of. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58623,Cartman,[grudgingly] I'm sorry. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58626,Cartman,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58631,Cartman,See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. [they are shown the door] 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58633,Cartman,"[keeping pace with Kyle] Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now? [stops] Kyle, where are you going? "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58635,Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean? Kyle? [settles on the obvious] Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58637,Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole! [Kyle enters Cartman's room and begins breaking anything he sees. First, a toy rocket. Then, he grabs a poster of Braveheart from the wall and rips it apart while screaming in rage. Next, he grabs the Wellington Bear Magic Mic and smashes it on the floor. Cartman walks in.] What the fuck are you doing?! [picks up some of his broken toys. Kyle knocks over a box of small toys] Kyle, stop it! [Kyle breaks apart a toy Mountie after three tries] God damn it, don't! [Kyle walks over to Cartman's big toy box, grabs Clyde Frog,..] Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone! [...and rips its head right off and moves off.] NO!! [Cartman picks up the two halves of his plush frog as Kyle moves to the XBOX] AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle! [Kyle picks it up and tries to pull it out of the power socket] Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND! [stops Kyle before Kyle gets to smash the XBOX on the floor] I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58639,Cartman,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58641,Cartman,Break my Xbox and you'll never know. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58643,Cartman,"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58645,Cartman,He was a basketball player. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58647,Cartman,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy. [grabs Kyle's shoulder] You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58649,Cartman,[stunned] My God... 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58651,Cartman,We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58653,Cartman,"Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58655,Cartman,"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58660,Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58662,Cartman,"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! [turns around and leaves Kyle standing there] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58665,Cartman,"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58667,Cartman,"Yeah, well, at least [leans into the aisle and looks back at the other passengers] it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58669,Cartman,"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here! [the flight attendant turns and walks away] We're on our way, buddy. [puts his left hand on Kyle's right hand] Magic Johnson, here we come. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58671,Cartman,[removes his hand from Kyle's and places his hands together over his stomach] I know. I'm scared too. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58677,Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58679,Cartman,"Kyle, we need to try to find a- "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58681,Cartman,"[thinks for a few seconds] I don't think it's funny, Kyle. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58683,Cartman,"[clears his throat] Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I- "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58685,Cartman,[waits a second] Are you sure? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58687,Cartman,"[waits a second] Are you HIV-positive? [Kyle smacks him] Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58714,Cartman,"Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58718,Cartman,All right! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58731,Cartman,"[grin vanishing] What?! Aw, no! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58733,Cartman,"What?! Aw, God damn it! [puts his arm around Kyle] Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58735,Cartman,"What? No. No. [runs after him] Kyle, no! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58742,Cartman,"Yeah, but we totally don't. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58752,Cartman,"Aw dude, that's our town! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58762,Cartman,That's enough to buy slaves! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58768,Cartman,[runs off] Sweet! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58780,Cartman,"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! [the boys make it through the crowd and approach a set of stairs. A security guard stops them] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58802,Cartman,"[aims his camera] All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'. "
12,3,Major Boobage,58989,Cartman,Cat pee? [Kenny lets up and then tries to choke himself again] 
12,3,Major Boobage,58993,Cartman,"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine. [Mr. Kitty meows] Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? [Mr. Kitty meows] "
12,3,Major Boobage,58996,Cartman,"Okay, ready Kenny? "
12,3,Major Boobage,58998,Cartman,"All right, bring out...! The other male cat. [Kyle walks to a pet carrier, opens the door, pulls out a brown striped cat, and places it on the coffee table opposite Mr. Kitty. The two cats meow at each other first, then growl at each other. After a short while, Mr. Kitty shoots concentrated piss into Kenny's face] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59002,Cartman,"Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? [Kenny's not responding. His mind is elsewhere...] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59009,Cartman,"[through Kenny's hallucination] Kenny! Kenny, wake up! [In the middle of town, Cartman is stopping Kenny from disrobing any further] Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny! "
12,3,Major Boobage,59011,Cartman,"Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59013,Cartman,"Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you? "
12,3,Major Boobage,59015,Cartman,"Ah, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle come up to restrain Kenny] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59052,Cartman,"Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off. [the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book] Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now. [drops the book in front of the cat] Here. Write a diary. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59059,Cartman,"Yeah, who has cats these days? [laughs nervously] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59085,Cartman,"[sits up] Mr. Kitty, shhh! [Mr. Kitty meows a 3rd time] Damn it! [gets up and leaves the bed. A small door to the attic opens and Cartman pops in with a candle. Mr. Kitty is nearby] Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you. [Mr. Kitty goes to a window and meows. Cartman follows him to the window] What?! [looks out a half-moon window and sees a cat, it meows] It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet. [Mr. Kitty meows] No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself. [Mr. Kitty meows] I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty. [crosses his arms] I'm in trouble enough as it is. [Mr. Kitty paws at Cartman] All right, all right, fine. [heads to the attic door and goes downstairs, closing the door behind him] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59087,Cartman,"[whispers and motions] All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly. [two kittens walk up next to Rufus] Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all. [they all look at him sadly, one of them meows] I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to- [the cats lower their head further while focusing on Cartman, Cartman starts to have tears in his eyes] Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. [turns and leaves] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59112,Cartman,Who is it?! 
12,3,Major Boobage,59114,Cartman,"[quickly looks both ways] Hiding cats? [nervously] Why, that would be illegal. [backs into the living room] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59116,Cartman,"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59118,Cartman,"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can- [his weakness comes through as the cat gazes at him] Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more... "
12,3,Major Boobage,59121,Cartman,"What the hell? [Kenny has somehow found the cats and is squeezing them to get cheesed. His face and parka are covered with concentrated piss. He grabs another cat and cheeses some more] Kenny, get out of here! "
12,3,Major Boobage,59123,Cartman,"Aw, crap- Kenny! [Cartman begins to follow him down, but stops temporarily] Bad. Kitties. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59127,Cartman,"He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59131,Cartman,"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! [crosses his arms and looks away. Stan opens his mouth in shock, Kyle looks angrily at Cartman] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59170,Cartman,"But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. [Kyle stops] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59172,Cartman,"[strokes his chin] Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59175,Cartman,"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59184,Cartman,"Oh God, I'm bored already. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59187,Cartman,"Gayness! [everyone laughs and looks at Ike, who looks chagrined.] "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59230,Cartman,We don't care. *urp* 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59242,Cartman,"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59246,Cartman,[jumps off the couch and runs to the TV] No! NOOO! 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59248,Cartman,We are NOT... resorting to that! 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59277,Cartman,How are we supposed to make money on the Internet? 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59280,Cartman,[steps up] Wait. I've got it. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59286,Cartman,There's more people viewing it! 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59318,Cartman,"Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59328,Cartman,"Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59332,Cartman,"Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59363,Cartman,Sweet. I think we're next in line now. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59375,Cartman,"...You are a homo, Butters. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59433,Cartman,"[raises his hand] Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59435,Cartman,Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59437,Cartman,[now on his desk and stretching that left arm up higher] Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59439,Cartman,Yes! [walks up next to Garrison's desk] 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59441,Cartman,[turns to the board and walks up to it. He grabs the wooden pointer and smacks it softly against his left palm] Well well well. Who's teacher now? [whips it against the floor] Yeahhh. Who's teacher?! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59443,Cartman,"That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended! [whips the pointer against the floor] Yeahhh. [whips the pointer against the floor again] Mmm yeah, you like that? [Kyle just rolls his eyes] All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here! [whips the pointer against the floor again] Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. [waves the pointer around a little and follows it with his eyes.] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59460,Cartman,Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59463,Cartman,"[at ease] Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59467,Cartman,That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me? 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59469,Cartman,"Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59471,Cartman,Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59473,Cartman,"Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk? "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59476,Cartman,"Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59478,Cartman,Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59487,Cartman,[dressed as Jaime Escalante] Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez. [holds up his left thumb] Your new teacher. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59489,Cartman,I am here... to teach you calculuuus. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59505,Cartman,"Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59508,Cartman,Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59510,Cartman,"How do I reach these keeds? [faces the class, his left hand tucked under the left pant pocket] The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time. [holds up a picture] This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59512,Cartman,"No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59514,Cartman,"Go ahead, the door's right there. [turns left] Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu. [the boy walks to the door and leaves. Cartman turns away from the class and sighs, dropping the photo] How do I reach these keeds? "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59521,Cartman,"Nice form, compadre. [walks towards the basket with the ball] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59523,Cartman,"Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game? [whistles] Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? [a scoreboard is shown, and a boy on the platform looks over at him] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59525,Cartman,"[gets into position] Okay, you start on defense, amigo. [dribbles the ball for a few seconds, then whacks the boy on the right shin with a collapsible pointer] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59527,Cartman,"Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo! "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59529,Cartman,"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn. [the boy is on offense. He dribbles for a few seconds and moves to the basket, but Cartman again takes out his pointer and whacks the boy's left shin. The boy falls again, and Cartman steals the ball and scores again. The boy at the scoreboard updates the score: 2-0 Visitors] That's two to nothing, amigoo. [his opponent stands up] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59531,Cartman,"Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. [throws the ball back at the boy] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59533,Cartman,"Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing! [sighs] How do I reach these keeds? "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59552,Cartman,"Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time. [hops onto a box so he could write on the chalkboard. He draws a video camera aimed at a box marked D] When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- [the errant student returns] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59554,Cartman,"Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack. [the student takes his seat] All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59556,Cartman,Good. Again. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59558,Cartman,Again! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59560,Cartman,Now you sound like white people! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59579,Cartman,The answer to #27 is 5. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59581,Cartman,The answer to #28 is 14. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59584,Cartman,"All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back. [leaves the classroom and looks around for the girl] Melita! Melita, hold on. [walks up to her] You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you? "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59586,Cartman,"[sighs] How do I reach these keeds? [turns around and faces her] All right, let's go get you an abortion. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59588,Cartman,Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you? 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59590,Cartman,"Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself. [Melita turns right and walks off a bit] Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59592,Cartman,"Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns. [walks around to face her] It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59629,Cartman,Uh what? 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59634,Cartman,"Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59636,Cartman,"How do I reeeach these keeeeds?! [the boy, cowed, slips back into his seat. Cartman faces the board] Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened? [dryly] They lost. [faces the class] Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59638,Cartman,You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59646,Cartman,[basking in the success] I reeached these keeeds. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59920,Cartman,"Let's be partners, Kenny. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59922,Cartman,"Okay. [turns and follows Stan] Stan, let's be partners, dude. [Stan approaches Wendy and holds out his hand. She takes it] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59924,Cartman,"Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad! [Wendy flashes him an angry look as he turns and walks away. He looks around and sees most everyone is paired off. He approaches Kyle] All right, let's be partners, Kyle. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59926,Cartman,"[miffed] Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Tolkien? [Clyde and Tolkien pair up] Who, who else needs a partner? [after the rest of the kids have paired up, only Butters is left. Cartman looks at him and he gets bashful all of a sudden, brushing his left foot back and forth on the ground] Uh who else needs a partner? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59928,Cartman,God damn it! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59930,Cartman,That isn't necessary! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59934,Cartman,"You can let go now, Butters. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59936,Cartman,"Butters, come on! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59950,Cartman,I wanna shoot an Indian. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59953,Cartman,"Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs. [just over the greenery is Super Phun Thyme, a small attraction next door.] ""Super... Phun Thyme."" [turns to Butters and has him step forward] Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59955,Cartman,"Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59957,Cartman,"Fine, then let go of my hand! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59959,Cartman,"Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59961,Cartman,"Fine, then you're comin' with me! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59963,Cartman,"Butters, let go God-damn it! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59992,Cartman,"Aw man, this is gonna be awesome! [the go through the double doors] Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59994,Cartman,"All right Butters, I've seriously had enough! [tries to rip his hand out of Butters' grip, but only succeeds in pulling Butters around. He tries again, but Butters isn't letting go. He tries a third time, all the way around, and Butters' hand is clamped on tight.] Jesus Christ! [drops the matter and goes to a counter with Butters] One please. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59999,Cartman,"Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60001,Cartman,"Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! [yanks Butters along.] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60022,Cartman,"Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60023,Cartman, I'm having a super fun time playin   
12,7,Super Fun Time,60025,Cartman,"Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here! [next they're playing air hockey. They take turns, but still have to run together in switching sides. They run to Butters' side and Butters hits the puck] Oh, you got it. Nice. [they run to Cartman's side, and Cartman hits the puck. They run back to Butters' side...] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60026,Cartman," Super fun time, please don't go awahay.   "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60029,Cartman," No more worries or cares, super fun time.   "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60030,Cartman,"[on a Road Hogg motorcycle ride as Butters gets on] Waiwait, keep- you're fine. [starts the ride. The motorcycle rocks back and forth quickly] Oh man, whoa! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60032,Cartman," The answer to my prayers, super fun time. Super fun time, you're all I need.   "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60034,Cartman,"Yeheah, we're wired up! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60035,Cartman," I'll have a super fun time till I freakin; bleed. I love you mornin' noon and night, super fun time.   "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60036,Cartman,"[two cars bump into him] Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! [Butters is battered] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60037,Cartman," You make my life so right, super fun time.   "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60040,Cartman,"Aw, just a few more things. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60042,Cartman,"Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. [they leave Super Phun Thyme] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60068,Cartman,"Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60070,Cartman,"Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60072,Cartman,"[stops in his tracks] Uh oh. [sees the police at the Pioneer Village entrance.] Crap, they called the cops on us. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60074,Cartman,They must have realized we left. Damn. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60076,Cartman,[covers Cartman's mouth and takes him behind a mail box] Shhh! Butters! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60078,Cartman,"Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60080,Cartman,"Butters, l-listen to me, listen. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60082,Cartman,All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60084,Cartman,"If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right? [Butters calms down and stops sobbing] All right, now let go of my hand. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60086,Cartman,Butters? 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60088,Cartman,"All right, come on! [they head back towards Super Phun Thyme] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60124,Cartman,"Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside. [turns left and points] Look, see that traffic signal down there? [the intersection is shown] If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60126,Cartman,"Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on. [they head to the signal. Butters is lighter, so he goes up first. He pulls Cartman along up the traffic signal, then stands on the arm] Good, that's good. [Cartman stands up too] That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across. [they begin to tip-toe along the traffic signal's arm.] Go easy. Good. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60128,Cartman,"It's all right. You've got it, no problem- [his left foot slips, causing them both to lose their balance] OP. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60130,Cartman,Save me! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60132,Cartman,"... Oh dude, laaame. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60150,Cartman,"Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look! [a big truck is headed their way] This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60152,Cartman,Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60154,Cartman,"Ready? Go! [they leap off the truck and over the wooden wall. The police are not aware of this. They land on a roof and roll of it into a wooden wheelbarrow, which tips over and dumps them onto the ground.] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60182,Cartman,"Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters. [they step out again and walk towards Vosky, who gets ready to shoot] Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60184,Cartman,"Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60186,Cartman,"Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60189,Cartman,What'd we do? We've been here the whole time. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60195,Cartman,Butters. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60198,Cartman,"Jesus Christ! [Vosky fires off a grenade, which hits a house just as Cartman and Butters run past it. The blast blows them off their feet] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60200,Cartman,AAAAH! [this and the gunfire alert the other robbers] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60240,Cartman,"[dreaming about being at the Opening Ceremonies] No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them! [The stadium lights come up and the drummers resume their drumming. Cartman is getting restless] No! No! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60242,Cartman,"[talking in his sleep] They're gonna... take over the world! HAA! [The drummers start up again] Too many of them. [Cartman now dreams of walking among the drummers] No! Leave us alone! [The drummers strike solidly on their drums, and Cartman now finds himself bouncing on the drums as they rise and fall under him] Nooo! [Four different groups of Chinese Olympians surround him. Cartman wakes from his nightmare and checks his face to be sure he's not dreaming] Damn it no! No! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60244,Cartman,"Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60246,Cartman,[sobbing] They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60248,Cartman,"[being serious] All right. Guys, we need to talk. [no response from the other three] You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something. [the other boys stay silent] Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60267,Cartman,"[bursts into the bathroom, startling Butters] There you are, Butters! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60269,Cartman,"Butters, I need your help. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60271,Cartman,"The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60273,Cartman,"I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60275,Cartman,"You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60277,Cartman,Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny. [with determination] Will you join me? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60279,Cartman,[hops onto the stool] So you'll join the American Liberation Front?! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60281,Cartman,"[cups Butters' right hand between his own two hands] You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60310,Cartman,"All right Butters, we're here. [sets the duffle bag down] Are you ready? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60312,Cartman,"This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now. [points at something across the street - a P.F. Chang's China Bistro] Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. [opens the duffle bag and begins to search through it] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60314,Cartman,"Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them. [pulls out a Chinese peasant hat] Here, put these teeth in! [hands him some buck teeth] And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot. [puts in his own buck teeth and squints his eyes] ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60319,Cartman,"[panics, voice rising] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60321,Cartman,It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60323,Cartman,"Ah yes, herro prease. [puts his hands together and bows a bit] We are Chinese peopull. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60326,Cartman,"Fruttar sheshar. [the greeter leaves] What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck! [goes into hushed tones and points] There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there! [Butters leans over and looks back. Sure enough, a Chinese family of five is looking at them] Do you see them? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60328,Cartman,"Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60330,Cartman,"They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go- [Butters smacks him, shutting him up] Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats. [they make their way to the family's table] Oh, herro, prease, herro. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60332,Cartman,"So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60334,Cartman,Ting ton teetong. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60337,Cartman,"Yeah, [gibberish] So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. [snickers. The family just stares at them] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60362,Cartman,"All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60364,Cartman,"Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60366,Cartman,What day is American invasion again? I fohget. [snickers] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60370,Cartman,"[thinks a bit] ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60372,Cartman,Oh my God... 
12,8,The China Probrem,60375,Cartman,"Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?! [moves into the main area of the restaurant] Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies! [a couple stops eating] The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall! [points to his right] I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. [pulls a gun from a pocket and hands it to Butters] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60377,Cartman,Hold the gun on them Butters! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60379,Cartman,"They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60381,Cartman,"Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move! [the guests rise from their seats with their hands up and move over to the wall Cartman pointed to] We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60383,Cartman,Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60385,Cartman,"Shoot him, Butters! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60387,Cartman,"You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60390,Cartman,"Aw dude, you shot him in the dick. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60392,Cartman,That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60394,Cartman,"[faces him] It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60423,Cartman,"Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us! [police sirens are heard approaching] Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! [walks towards the front doors] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60425,Cartman,"[walks outside] No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu- [notices something different. The camera shows that one of the police officers is Chinese] AAH! [runs back inside and back to Butters] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60427,Cartman,"[quite agitated] One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters! [heads to a window with Butters in tow, and opens it] Don't come any closer! We have information that we will only trust with the President of the United States! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60430,Cartman,"No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! [Butters shuts his eyes and shoots. The Chinese officer is struck in the groin and it explodes all over his clothes] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60432,Cartman,Dude! What the fuck are you doing?! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60434,Cartman,"God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60436,Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool! [looks away for a few moments, but...] You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60438,Cartman,...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick! [walks away] God damn it! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60467,Cartman,"No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I [POP. Cartman looks around, then drops the phone and runs to the source of the pop. Butters has fired the gun again. Cartman runs up to him] What happened?! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60469,Cartman,Good! Did you kill him? [grins in hope] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60473,Cartman,Dude... 
12,8,The China Probrem,60475,Cartman,"Dude! [Butters looks to his right and down] You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. [walks off] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60477,Cartman,"[near the front doors, turns around and jabs a finger at Butters] You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60479,Cartman,I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass. [walks out of the restaurant in defeat towards the waiting officers] That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60511,Cartman,"I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters. [turns aside] You think about it. [turns and walks away.] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60516,Cartman,She said it again. [laughs] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60518,Cartman,"[enjoying his distraction] Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom? "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60521,Cartman,"Me? You're the one talking about killer titties. [Clyde contains a giggle] Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people. [holds his hands out as if grabbing at people] Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60525,Cartman,"I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60527,Cartman,"Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone. [the other boys (except Stan and Kyle) laugh. He joins them] Dude, I'm on fire today! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60529,Cartman,"Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose. [points to the ceiling] Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof. [Wendy turns and glares at him. Cartman talks into an imaginary walkie talkie] ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" [Wendy suddenly gets in Cartman's face] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60531,Cartman,"Not at all. [cups his hands again as if they're killer titties] ""Wendy, we're gonna get you, Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"" "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60533,Cartman,"Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy? "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60535,Cartman,"Haha, you're gonna kick my ass? "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60537,Cartman,"[begins to act like a gangbanger] You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60539,Cartman,[takes what looks like a gang pose] Whassup? [takes another one] Whassup? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60541,Cartman,"Standing right here, let's go, bitch. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60543,Cartman,You're gonna fight me after school? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60545,Cartman,"You're a chick, dude. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60547,Cartman,"[poses again] Oh, it's on, bitch! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60562,Cartman,"She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60564,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. [Cartman looks at Wendy again, and Wendy stares back. She makes a fist with her right hand and punches the open palm of her left hand.] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60568,Cartman,"Wendy, could I talk to you for a second? "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60570,Cartman,"[almost whispering] Wendy, I want to apologize, and, um, tell you that- "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60572,Cartman,"[takes her aside and whispers] I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60574,Cartman,"[takes her aside further and whispers] Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60576,Cartman,"[seeing the unwanted attention] Pfft, apologize?! [begins to strike poses] That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60578,Cartman,"Oh, Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60580,Cartman,"[trying to put up a front] Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo. [Wendy goes back to her locker, the other kids go their separate ways. Wendy shuts her locker door and Cartman races up to her again. He whispers] Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60592,Cartman,"[peers out from the doorway] Wendy. Wendy, psst. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60594,Cartman,"Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick. [Wendy goes into the room Cartman was hiding in, which is a storage room. Once inside, she looks around, taking it all in.] Wendy, you're not gonna believe this. [She turns and glares at him] I just found out my mom has breast cancer. [she glares harder] Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60596,Cartman,"Wendy, [pulls out a letter-sized envelope] I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight, then I- "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60598,Cartman,"[puts his left hand up to hold her back] Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60600,Cartman,[thinks for a moment] My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60602,Cartman,Eat my underwear? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60604,Cartman,"[walks a few steps away] Okay. Okay, Wendy, I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60606,Cartman,"No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60608,Cartman,"I'll eat my underwear, Wendy. [unzips his pants.] And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60610,Cartman,"I'm committed to peace, Wendy. [begins to swallow his underwear] I want you to see just how humbled I am... [gags] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60612,Cartman,"[rather muffled] Euugh. Wendy? Look at me, Wendy. [tries one last swallow and succeeds] There. Yeahm. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60614,Cartman,So... [turns to face her] are we cool? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60618,Cartman,"[throws himself at her mercy] Wendy it isn't fair! [she runs out of there quickly] I ate my underwear for you! Nooo! [Craig walks by and stops to look in] Yo, what's up dawg? "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60620,Cartman,"Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60622,Cartman,"You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60624,Cartman,"Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60626,Cartman,"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60628,Cartman,"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well, Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."", but she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man, you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way- [his gag reflex kicks in and his underwear comes back up his throat and out of his mouth. Stan looks on a bit stunned as Cartman pulls his underwear the rest of the way out, then glances back and forth at his underwear and at Stan] Oh, that's where I put those. [puts his underwear into a back pocket] Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60630,Cartman,"[runs to Stan's left, by the sinks] God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! [his underwear is hanging from his right hand. Cartman notices, then runs out of the bathroom. Stan looks down helplessly] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60638,Cartman,"[a revelation] Detention! That's it! [begins to fidget: ""I've gotta get detention, fast!"" The minute hand hits 0 and Cartman runs out of his seat towards the front of the class. He gets on Mr. Garrison's desk, shoves the Homework Assignments holder off the desk, lowers his pants, and leaves a nice brown gift on the desk. Mr. Garrison looks at him. The class is stunned as Cartman looks back at Mr. Garrison] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60640,Cartman,"[strikes some gang poses] Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? [Wendy's especially shocked. No one says a word until...] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60644,Cartman,"[puts his feet up on the table and his hands behind his head, certain he's gotten out of the fight with Wendy] Ahhh, sweet. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60646,Cartman,What?! That's ridiculous! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60648,Cartman,That's not why I did it. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60650,Cartman,"[begins to pose] Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60652,Cartman,"Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60655,Cartman,[shocked] Huh? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60668,Cartman,"[whining] The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60670,Cartman,"The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him again] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60681,Cartman,"Okay, Mommy. Mama, Mama. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60684,Cartman,"Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60687,Cartman,"[begins to strike poses as Wendy walks by] What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60689,Cartman,Why not? You chicken? [begins to strut and cluck like a chicken] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60691,Cartman,"Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60693,Cartman,"I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60698,Cartman,Told you guys. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60705,Cartman,"[clears his throat] Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness. [Wendy lifts her head up in surprise] I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest. [stifles a laugh] We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. [stifles a laugh again] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60707,Cartman,What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60710,Cartman,"[cautioning] Wendy, Wendy. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60729,Cartman,"Go deep, Craig. [throws the football at Craig, who is off-screen] Not that deep, retard! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60731,Cartman,"Butters, get out of here! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60733,Cartman,"[in disbelief] ...Huh? [Butters turns left and looks at the building, smiling. Cartman looks to his right. The side doors fly open and Wendy walks down the steps spoiling for a fight. The students cheer her on as she turns left and heads for the playground. Some girls trail behind her, Bebe being the first among them.] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60738,Cartman,"[wavering] What- what's up? [begins posing] What what's up? [draws close to her and cautions in a whisper] Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60740,Cartman,"Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60742,Cartman,"Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully! [takes off his jacket and tosses it aside] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60751,Cartman,[demoralized] You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag. [begins to wail] My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. [wails some more] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60753,Cartman,That's not true! You're just saying that! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60756,Cartman,You're all just saying that to make me feel better. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60759,Cartman,"Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. [the guys look at each other, sure that Cartman misunderstood them] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60761,Cartman,"[seeing a positive side to this somehow] If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief! [jumps up and clicks his feet up in the air] Oh, yay! [jumps up again] "
12,10,Pandemic,60765,Cartman,Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls? 
12,10,Pandemic,60769,Cartman,What girl is gonna see your balls? 
12,10,Pandemic,60772,Cartman,Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same. 
12,10,Pandemic,60776,Cartman,"[follows] Yeah, me too. [Kyle follows Cartman and Kenny keeps dancing.] "
12,10,Pandemic,60779,Cartman,Shut up already! 
12,10,Pandemic,60799,Cartman,"I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces... [moves Kyle's piece back seven spaces and softly says] ...screw you Kyle. [normal voice] Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. [tosses the dice to him] "
12,10,Pandemic,60801,Cartman,So? 
12,10,Pandemic,60803,Cartman,How much? 
12,10,Pandemic,60806,Cartman,Really? Are you sure? 
12,10,Pandemic,60810,Cartman,[stands up] Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys. 
12,10,Pandemic,60815,Cartman,"Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro? "
12,10,Pandemic,60817,Cartman,"Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday? "
12,10,Pandemic,60821,Cartman,"Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome. "
12,10,Pandemic,60824,Cartman,[applauds] All right Craig! [pats him on the back] 
12,10,Pandemic,60827,Cartman,"And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig. "
12,10,Pandemic,60829,Cartman,"Craig, don't be an asshole. "
12,10,Pandemic,60833,Cartman,"And a one, and a two, and a- [the boys launch into their rendition of ""Mary Had A Little Lamb""] "
12,10,Pandemic,60836,Cartman,"[as the men leave] Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. [in their briefcase are $10 CDs from their band, the Llama Brothers, ""Tapas and Moonscapes"". Man 1 whips out a fresh $10 bill and buys a CD] "
12,10,Pandemic,60841,Cartman,Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! [leads the other boys to the competing band] 
12,10,Pandemic,60843,Cartman,No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno! 
12,10,Pandemic,60846,Cartman,No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku] 
12,10,Pandemic,60849,Cartman,"No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui! "
12,10,Pandemic,60861,Cartman,"Ha! [sticks his right middle finger up] Serves you right, assholes! [behind them the third band is subdued] "
12,10,Pandemic,60945,Cartman,And we're white. 
12,10,Pandemic,60956,Cartman,"You're being extremely negative, Craig. [Chertoff and the others return] "
12,10,Pandemic,60998,Cartman,There's no talking to this guy. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61084,Cartman,"You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61086,Cartman,Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61127,Cartman,That's right. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61149,Cartman,"Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. [points to his left] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61152,Cartman,What is it? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61157,Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! [the boys enter] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61164,Cartman,Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61167,Cartman,"Dude, it's Craig! "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61172,Cartman,"Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig? "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61217,Cartman,"Yeah, it's coming from up there. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61219,Cartman,"Dude, that's awesome. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61233,Cartman,"[Craig leads the boys across the Nazca Plateau] Dude, Craig, we should go back now. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61237,Cartman,"[the boys walk through a thunderstorm] Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61256,Cartman,"Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up! "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61281,Cartman,That guy's an asshole! 
12,12,About Last Night...,61374,Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61564,Cartman,"Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. [Kenny indeed has a plain bologna sandwich and a glass of water.] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61569,Cartman,There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich! 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61580,Cartman,[puzzled] What the hell are they doing? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61584,Cartman,"Dude, girls are such fags. [suddenly, Clyde, Craig, Jimmy, Tolkien, and Jason leave the table and join the girls] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61604,Cartman,"This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. [silence follows for a few seconds, then Stan holds up the DVD case] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61607,Cartman,"Well, I'm out guys. [get up from the sofa, puts on his jacket, and heads for the front door] If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61616,Cartman,Ehhhhhhh. [Stan stops writing] 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61618,Cartman,I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61620,Cartman,"...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. [The bell rings and Mr. Garrison walks in with his books] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61712,Cartman,"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61714,Cartman,"Fuck you, Kyle! [upon entering the building, they are met by a pre-class musical production] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61719,Cartman,"Oh God, shut up! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61721,Cartman,Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup! 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61762,Cartman,"Oh that's good, that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. [Stan walks into the living room and stands to one side of the sofa] Yeah, nice. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61765,Cartman,No way dude. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61770,Cartman,"Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."" "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61772,Cartman,"""Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" [Kenny laughs] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61778,Cartman,"""That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."" "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61820,Cartman,I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61828,Cartman,"You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61830,Cartman,"That's a low blow, Stan. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61842,Cartman,[approaches two other kids]  But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.   
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61846,Cartman," And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews. And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- [rejoins the chorus line with Kyle]   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61851,Cartman, Don't stress about it or you just might faint.   
12,14,The Ungroundable,61865,Cartman,"Aw man, you've got to be kidding me. [Cartman is playing a WW2 shooter on his computer, with Japanese warcries sounding] Goddamn Japs are everywhere. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61869,Cartman,"Oh, who just shot me? [Bebe leans back in her chair, looks at Cartman, and gives him the finger] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61871,Cartman,"Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61882,Cartman,"All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61884,Cartman,"Yeah, now get out of here. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61886,Cartman,"Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62022,Cartman,Butters? [Butters continues] Butters?! [Butters backs up and then hops off the bed] 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62024,Cartman,"Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62026,Cartman,Dude! [Liane enters] 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62030,Cartman,"Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62032,Cartman,Yes. 
13,1,The Ring,62118,Cartman,"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it? "
13,1,The Ring,62121,Cartman,"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened. [the boys are looking at Kenny and a girl eating alone together at another table.] Kenny has a girlfriend. "
13,1,The Ring,62125,Cartman,Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me. 
13,1,The Ring,62133,Cartman,"[getting irritated] Butters, what's the problem? "
13,1,The Ring,62137,Cartman,"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face! "
13,1,The Ring,62151,Cartman,"Kenny. [deep sigh, puts his right hand on Kenny's back for sympathy] Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's. "
13,1,The Ring,62153,Cartman,"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude. "
13,1,The Ring,62155,Cartman,[moments later] He took it pretty well. 
13,1,The Ring,62169,Cartman,"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? [Kenny continues walking, the other three join him as he walks across the parking lot] "
13,1,The Ring,62175,Cartman,[forcibly stops Kenny] Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs! 
13,1,The Ring,62187,Cartman,"[reaches out to Kenny and stops him] Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis? "
13,1,The Ring,62256,Cartman,"Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear. "
13,1,The Ring,62260,Cartman,Purity ring? 
13,1,The Ring,62321,Cartman,[takes the DVD and looks at the front cover. Kenny freezes with his left hand held out] Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?! 
13,1,The Ring,62323,Cartman,"[notices that Kenny has stopped responding.] Kenny? Kenny? [snaps his fingers] Kenny? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna look at Playboy? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny? "
13,1,The Ring,62328,Cartman,"[notices something on the shelf next to him] Oh my God, look at this! [grabs it and looks at it] Motherfucker! "
13,1,The Ring,62330,Cartman,"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! [throws the magazine to the floor] "
13,1,The Ring,62356,Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes! "
13,1,The Ring,62361,Cartman,This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by [a dart strike him in the neck and knocks him out quick] teh- ...tehhhh [falls on his face] 
13,1,The Ring,62372,Cartman,The hell did you do to us?! 
13,1,The Ring,62416,Cartman,"[during the eulogy] I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said. "
13,1,The Ring,62418,Cartman,And knowing is half the battle. 
13,2,The Coon,62420,Cartman,"[voice over] The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse. [A shot of Tele's TV store ""Closed until further notice due to BAD ECONOMY""] The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down. [a shadow runs across the screen, in a cape. Next scene: an alley looking towards the street. An Obama poster for CHANGE is shown, with WHEN? spray-painted over the word] Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things. [the shadow climbs up a pipe and runs across the roof of the building opposite the alley entrance] He didn't. [next shot is that of a street under a threatening red sky] As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection. [another alley. An aluminum trash can falls over, spilling its contents. The shadow appears on a wall, larger than life, then runs away] There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage. [A rain gutter is shown. The shadow runs across the screen again, closer to the camera] To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man. [another rooftop. The camera finds the shadow and zooms in on it.] I'm the hero this town needs. I am... [the shadow turns and is lit up. It's Cartman dressed as...] the Coon! [Cartman looks up to the sky, and graphics for ""The Coon"" pop up. Next scene, the Coon runs down a street and leaps onto the roof of a car] As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. [he leaps off the car] "
13,2,The Coon,62460,Cartman,Hey guys. Good morning. [the guys don't respond to him at all] You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon. 
13,2,The Coon,62462,Cartman,"I know, right? [enunciating] ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace. "
13,2,The Coon,62464,Cartman,"[stunned, turns to Kyle and points] You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you! "
13,2,The Coon,62466,Cartman,He's not a fag! 
13,2,The Coon,62468,Cartman,"[straightens up and moves off a bit] Oh. I uh... well I ah ah [crosses his arms] I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante? [neither of them answer him] Kenny? "
13,2,The Coon,62470,Cartman,"And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? [he's wearing a ""Who is the Coon?"" shirt] Is he a hero or a menace? [half the class is bored, and Clyde is asleep at his desk. Mr. Garrison reads quietly at his desk] While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now- [spots the sleeper] Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important. [Clyde wakes up and looks around in a daze] What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too. "
13,2,The Coon,62490,Cartman,"[voice over. He's seated alone on a merry-go-round] Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens. [shuts his eyes] No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus. [opens his eyes, keeping a look of determination on his face] Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate. "
13,2,The Coon,62503,Cartman,[sadly] Hunh! 
13,2,The Coon,62505,Cartman,"I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices! "
13,2,The Coon,62507,Cartman,I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life! 
13,2,The Coon,62510,Cartman,"[suddenly hopeful, looks at the TV] Wha, what? "
13,2,The Coon,62512,Cartman,[angrily] What?! 
13,2,The Coon,62519,Cartman,Fuckin' butthole! 
13,2,The Coon,62522,Cartman,You gotta be kidding me! 
13,2,The Coon,62525,Cartman,[shakes in anger] AAAAAHT!! [turns right and leaves in a huff] 
13,2,The Coon,62540,Cartman,"So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?! "
13,2,The Coon,62542,Cartman,"Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! [grabs Stan's right hand and sniffs it vigorously, then lets it go and looks around for other suspects] "
13,2,The Coon,62544,Cartman,"Aha! Kenny! I should have known! [walks over to Kenny's locker and points] Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?! [points at Kenny] Unless you are Mysterion! "
13,2,The Coon,62547,Cartman,What?! Why? 
13,2,The Coon,62549,Cartman,"It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?! "
13,2,The Coon,62551,Cartman,[gasps and walks away a bit to watch Wendy leave] Fucking bitch... 
13,2,The Coon,62632,Cartman,"[offscreen] Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62706,Cartman,"And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft... "
13,3,Margaritaville,62736,Cartman,"[arrives and sighs] Hengh! [the squirrels run off] Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS! [stomps his left foot down] Hengh! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62738,Cartman,"[leaps towards him] Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62740,Cartman,"The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62745,Cartman,"Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62773,Cartman,"I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. [begins to sob, and a rowdy crowd approaches from the right] "
13,3,Margaritaville,62814,Cartman,"Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62830,Cartman,"[stands up in his seat] All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool! [checks for a reaction] That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick! [clears his throat and sits down] Go ahead, Kyle. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62873,Cartman,"Oh, man, I thought that day would never end. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62880,Cartman,Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62883,Cartman,"No! No, nono, you're right, Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. [walks from his locker to the middle of the hall, turns around, farts, and walks back to his locker. A little girl walks into the fart fumes and all the boys laugh] "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62887,Cartman,Let's get to my house!! [the boys run out of school chattering away while the girls remain in the hall annoyed] 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62896,Cartman,"[walks in with some snacks for himself and spots Craig on the sofa] Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62898,Cartman,"It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! [Craig moves to an empty spot on the floor as Cartman takes his place on the sofa] "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62907,Cartman,What? 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62914,Cartman,What the fuck is this?! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62926,Cartman,Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62937,Cartman,"No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62940,Cartman,"You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62942,Cartman,Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! [more girls begin to appear] 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62948,Cartman,You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! [the girls have heard enough and leave] 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62958,Cartman,"And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly... "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62960,Cartman,"Yes, that's good. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63058,Cartman,"Hey Butters. How you holding up, man? "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63060,Cartman,"We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63066,Cartman,"You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63079,Cartman,"Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you [points to the poster] it's not a joke. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63085,Cartman,"Sick! Stop it, lady! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63134,Cartman,It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63145,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? [closes the door and walks up to Jimmy] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63147,Cartman,"Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63149,Cartman,"[heads to the sofa and lays down on his back] Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63151,Cartman,"[while munching] No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63153,Cartman,"No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. [Jimmy sighs and throws away a sheet of jokes. Hours later there are many more sheets on the floor] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63155,Cartman,Meh. [Jimmy tosses away another crumpled sheet] 
13,5,Fishsticks,63158,Cartman,"Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63160,Cartman,"Yeah, I like fishsticks. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63162,Cartman,"What, dude, you got something? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63164,Cartman,Yeah. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63166,Cartman,Yeah. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63168,Cartman,"[thinks through the joke] Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63172,Cartman,"Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63176,Cartman,"Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63178,Cartman,Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth? 
13,5,Fishsticks,63180,Cartman,"[points to Clyde with both index fingers] What are you, Clyde? A gay fish? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63182,Cartman,"Tolkien, Tolkien, got a question for you: [clears his throat] Tolkien, do you like fishsticks? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63184,Cartman,[motions to Butters to keep quiet for now] Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters. [back to Tolkien] You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth? 
13,5,Fishsticks,63186,Cartman,What are you? 
13,5,Fishsticks,63231,Cartman,"And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63233,Cartman,"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63235,Cartman,"Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63237,Cartman,"Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! [smiles, takes his tray and walks away] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63264,Cartman,"[shakes with rage, then turns left and walks away] Motherfucker! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63266,Cartman,"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63268,Cartman,"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63270,Cartman,"But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63272,Cartman,What?! 
13,5,Fishsticks,63274,Cartman,"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63276,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63278,Cartman,"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63280,Cartman,"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish? [Jimmy and Cartman laugh, but Cartman notices something on Jimmy's desk.] Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! [gets off the couch, gets a newspaper, walks over to the desk, and smashes the spider dead.] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63284,Cartman,"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63286,Cartman,"It's cool man, it's cool. [turns around and walks away] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63301,Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63303,Cartman,"[walks off a bit] It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke. [Kyle zips up and goes to the sink to wash his hands] I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. [Kyle finishes up, grabs a paper towel, wipes his hands dry, and turns to Cartman] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63305,Cartman,You do? 
13,5,Fishsticks,63307,Cartman,"[after some thought] But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63309,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63311,Cartman,That's cool. You wanna write some together? [walks out of view] 
13,5,Fishsticks,63313,Cartman,"[pulls up a chair] Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63316,Cartman,"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer. [she walks off] Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?"" "
13,5,Fishsticks,63318,Cartman,"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?"" "
13,5,Fishsticks,63321,Cartman,"It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! [leaps out of his seat with a sword out of nowhere and slashes the dragon across the chest, making it bleed. It falls on its back all of a sudden. Eric leaps onto its body and stabs the sword into its chest. It dies.] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63325,Cartman,Thanks you guys! 
13,5,Fishsticks,63327,Cartman,"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63346,Cartman,"Hi Ellen. [to the audience] Do you guys like fishsticks? [the audience laughs] Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63349,Cartman,"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63352,Cartman,Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. [the audience applauds and cheers] 
13,5,Fishsticks,63355,Cartman,"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63357,Cartman,Uhhh excuse me? [the crowd gets rowdy.] 
13,5,Fishsticks,63361,Cartman,"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63363,Cartman,"Yeah, that was kewl huh? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63365,Cartman,Whassat? 
13,5,Fishsticks,63367,Cartman,So... here it is. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63369,Cartman,"That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did! [Kanye kicks the bedroom door open and enters the room. His men pour in and start smashing the furniture apart] Dude, it's Puff Daddy! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63374,Cartman,"Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63376,Cartman,"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63378,Cartman,Hello Jim. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63380,Cartman,[moves the glasses back over his cap] What are you up to? 
13,5,Fishsticks,63382,Cartman,"Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. [goes for a chair] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63384,Cartman,"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63386,Cartman,"Thanks. [Sarah walks away] So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look around.] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63389,Cartman,"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here? [takes off his glasses] Flame on! [becomes engulfed in flames and flies into the air. He then sends streams of flames at the robots, destroying them instantly. He flies back down to his starting point] Flame off! [the flames disappear. Other fourth graders appear: Annie, Millie, Red, Clyde, Tolkien and Wendy] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63391,Cartman,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke! [runs in and finishes the joke in a flourish. Jimmy walks in] ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! [other kids look in] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63394,Cartman,Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63396,Cartman,"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63398,Cartman,"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63400,Cartman,"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63402,Cartman,"I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are. [Kanye looks as if Cartman is talking about him] Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63660,Cartman,You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63663,Cartman,"Haven't you assholes been watching the news? [rolls the map flat on the table] Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here: [points to the circled nation on the map] Somalia. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63665,Cartman,"North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63667,Cartman,"I've worked it all out on Expedia. [traces the route from Denver to Somalia] We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63669,Cartman,"Right, and wi- [stops] Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63671,Cartman,"Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63673,Cartman,Then why don't you wanna go? 
13,7,Fatbeard,63676,Cartman,"That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle. [rolls up the map] Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! [walks away] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63680,Cartman,"Avast there, mateys! [the class looks up at the speaker] Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life? [a shot of some kids in the hall, including sixth graders] Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time? [a shot of the kindergarten class, and its teacher] Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr! [back to Mr. Garrison's class] Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends! [Kyle looks at the blackboard, his eyes half-closed. Stan begins to write stuff down] Even Kyle said so. [Kyle buries his face into his desk] Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63682,Cartman,"There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63686,Cartman,"Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh... [sees Gordon Stoltski, then goes into a low voice] Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63688,Cartman,"But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63690,Cartman,"Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63692,Cartman,We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63694,Cartman,"Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63696,Cartman,Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! [holds up a jeweled sword] 
13,7,Fatbeard,63700,Cartman,"Kevin, Goddammit! [Kevin turns off the lightsaber's light] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63703,Cartman,"We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63705,Cartman,"That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63707,Cartman,What?! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63710,Cartman,"You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63712,Cartman,Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63714,Cartman,"Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63719,Cartman,"The FUCK?! [some Somalis notice them and stop to look] 'Scuse me, where are the pirates? [stops a man walking by] Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh! [the man ignores him and keeps on walking.] Butters, get the phrase book out. [Butters approaches with the phrase book in hand] Ask these people where the pirates are. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63724,Cartman,"Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! [the boys turn and walk towards the building] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63726,Cartman,"Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. [dismissing the warning, he and his crew continue on to the building.] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63728,Cartman,"Avast! [no one else says a word. In a low voice, he says] These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63732,Cartman,I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with. 
13,7,Fatbeard,63735,Cartman,"Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63739,Cartman,"Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. [they all stop next to a small boat] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63742,Cartman,"This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63745,Cartman,"Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63747,Cartman,"Kevin, Jesus Christ! [a pirate starts the motor and the boat moves forward] Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah! [Clyde begins to cry] Clyde, the fuck?! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63749,Cartman,"Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63751,Cartman,"Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please? [Ike looks at Clyde and smacks him. Clyde stops crying] Very nice, Ike. [looks ahead] All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! [before them is a French cruise ship] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63762,Cartman,Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this. [takes the bullhorn from him] Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63764,Cartman,"Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63784,Cartman,The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63787,Cartman,"Alright, let's go! [the boys go up the ladder and board the ship] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63791,Cartman,"Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63793,Cartman,"Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63795,Cartman,"I said, get off my boat! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63798,Cartman,"That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs! [the captain and crew get on the lifeboat] Lower 'em down, Ike. [Ike lowers the lifeboat to the ocean] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63801,Cartman,"Hard to port, lads! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63804,Cartman,"Just make the boat go that way, kind of. [the ship ends up turning towards shore, towards the pirates' lair.] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63806,Cartman,That's good. Now bring her around topside. [the cruise ship pulls up alongside the pier and lowers the rope ladder. The boys get off the ship and head back to the lair. Cartman stops for a moment and points it out to the pirates] Now that's a pirate ship! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63808,Cartman,"[the boys head enter the bar] A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves? [starts tossing wads of cash at pirates] Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around. [walks to an open table and has the boys sit there] A round of grog for me boys! [a pirate brings drinks to the table and passes them out] A round of grog for everyone! [the pirate leaves] The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates! [gets up and walks around] Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy! [the pirate he's looking at has lost his left leg from the knee down] Look at this guy for Christ's sake! [rips a leg from a chair and ties it up the pirate's left leg] I mean, how hard is this, people?! [the pirate grins and hobbles away with his new peg leg. Cartman walks back to the boys' table, then stands on it] I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!  Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please!  We get all that we want for free!    "
13,7,Fatbeard,63810,Cartman,[sighs] Goddamnit people!  With a yo ho ho!   
13,7,Fatbeard,63812,Cartman, And with a yee hee hee!

13,7,Fatbeard,63828,Cartman,"Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a ""lahty do"" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the ""lahty"" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second ""yo ho"". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? [Ike is at a spinet piano] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63830,Cartman,Better!  With a yo ho ho!   
13,7,Fatbeard,63833,Cartman, And a tricky lahty do!   
13,7,Fatbeard,63839,Cartman, Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.   
13,7,Fatbeard,63850,Cartman,"What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh? [a shot is heard, followed by commotion from the pirates. Cartman and the boys walk over to a crowd of pirates gathered around something] What's going on? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63853,Cartman,"Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom. [the crowd splits in two and Kyle is shown. Kyle is tied up so he can't use his arms. Ike looks happy to see Kyle.] Well well well well well! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63858,Cartman,Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club. 
13,7,Fatbeard,63860,Cartman,"""It isn't safe."" That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was ""awesome."" "
13,7,Fatbeard,63862,Cartman,"Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63864,Cartman,"Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63884,Cartman,"Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63886,Cartman,"That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63890,Cartman,What?! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63892,Cartman,Clyde! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63894,Cartman,"[threatens the other three boys with his sword; they back down] You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63896,Cartman,"Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit! [whistles] To arms! [the real pirates gather around and aim their rifles at the boys] Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an entire pirate crew willing to do anything for me! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63899,Cartman,"Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! [a volley of bullets takes down all the pirates, leaving the six boys unharmed. The boys look at the carnage around them] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63901,Cartman,The FUCK?! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63935,Cartman,"'Sup, Jew? "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63937,Cartman,HA! What a dumbass! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63940,Cartman,"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?! [hops off the sofa] Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63942,Cartman,Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63944,Cartman,"The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here! [quickly flips through the channels until a Billy Mays commercial appears] Here here! This, this is him! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63952,Cartman,That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63954,Cartman,"Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63956,Cartman,"Because he was a great person, Kyle. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63958,Cartman,"...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call... "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64000,Cartman,"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64003,Cartman,"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64010,Cartman,[concerned] Oh my God... poor Billy Mays... 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64014,Cartman,Billy Mays! [makes his way to the front of the group] It's him! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64016,Cartman,"Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64054,Cartman,Including the late and very talented Billy Mays! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64073,Cartman,[rolls his eyes up in thought] Was I alarmed? [closes his eyes] Yes. [opens them and looks at Kyle] I believe I was. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64075,Cartman,"[correcting him] Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. [Kyle's jaw drops in alarm] "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64077,Cartman,Yes! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64079,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal! [Kyle puts his hands down below the table] People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! [points to Stan] "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64082,Cartman,A child... and a female. And white. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64095,Cartman,Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64099,Cartman,God I hope this works. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64124,Cartman,"Hey, what the F?! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64132,Cartman,"Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge. [a shot of the judge] She's eating Chipotle. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64134,Cartman,"So maybe she doesn't know. [grabs Kyle by his coat collar] Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64136,Cartman,Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64138,Cartman,What if you didn't have to give it up? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64140,Cartman,I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64144,Cartman,Yeah! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64146,Cartman,"Alright! [one of the contestants stomps her foot and cries, then walks off stage] "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64152,Cartman,"Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64165,Cartman,"Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this. [Cartman and Craig are at a tetherball pole, and Cartman is holding the ball. Around them are a bunch of boys, most of them from the fourth grade] Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" [the camera pulls back a bit, and Butters is seen at the top of the tetherball pole, hanging from his briefs.] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64167,Cartman,"Alright, your turn Craig. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64169,Cartman,Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64172,Cartman,"Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl. [Craig hits the ball and it wraps around the pole until it hits Butters on the face] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64184,Cartman,"Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64188,Cartman,"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64203,Cartman,Atta boy Butters! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64257,Cartman,"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64342,Cartman,"Dude, we've created a monster. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64443,Cartman,"Oh my God, dude, this is sooo awesome! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64449,Cartman,"Oh, sweet! [the woman in black bra pulls on the other woman's arm using her right leg as leverage, then begins pummeling her. Cena throws Edge against the ropes] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64452,Cartman,This is awesome! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64454,Cartman,Dude! That was so badass! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64458,Cartman,The fuck is this?! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64463,Cartman,I did. I'm the Rad Russian. [affects a fake Russian accent] I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64468,Cartman,All right! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64470,Cartman,The Rad Russian. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64472,Cartman,"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64474,Cartman,Huh? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64476,Cartman,Okay... 
13,10,W.T.F.,64480,Cartman,The fuck is this?! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64482,Cartman,Dude! Dude! DUDE! [jumps to his feet] The fuck are you doing?! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64484,Cartman,"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64490,Cartman,"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. [they all take off their headgear and walk away] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64495,Cartman,"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64497,Cartman,"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64500,Cartman,"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64502,Cartman,"Alright are you ready to try this, guys? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64504,Cartman,"Alright, let's start wrestlin'. [the boys take their starting positions] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64506,Cartman,"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! [Cartman slaps him hard, and Jimmy falls. Butters intervenes.] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64508,Cartman,"Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste-[Jimmy sneaks up behind him with a folding chair and smashes it into the back of his head, making him fall forward] ah! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64510,Cartman,"[whispers aloud] Wait for it, wait for the whore line. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64524,Cartman,And just what do you care about your pitiful country?! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64541,Cartman,"I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64553,Cartman,"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64558,Cartman,It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. [the crowd boos and expresses its disapproval] 
13,10,W.T.F.,64560,Cartman,Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64564,Cartman,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! [screams, runs up to Stan with a steel chair, and smashes him with it, knocking him down] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64582,Cartman,"Alright you guys, let's bring it in. [the boys huddle and hold hands] I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64587,Cartman,"Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64604,Cartman,"[rushing in with a letter] You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64606,Cartman,We just received a letter from the WWE. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64609,Cartman,"""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."" "
13,10,W.T.F.,64617,Cartman,"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64633,Cartman,"Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64635,Cartman,"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64637,Cartman,"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64639,Cartman,"Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Tolkien, Butters, Jimmy. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64642,Cartman,"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Tolkien? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64646,Cartman,Right? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64649,Cartman,"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64651,Cartman,"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64654,Cartman,Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64657,Cartman,It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64659,Cartman,"Number seventeen step forward, please? [a man steps forward shielding his eyes from the glare of the spotlights] You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64661,Cartman,"Thank you! Number twenty-four? [another man steps forth as Number 17 returns to his place] You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64663,Cartman,Thank you. [Number 24 returns to his place] 
13,10,W.T.F.,64667,Cartman,"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again. [Number 37 steps forward] We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64670,Cartman,"Yeah, this guy crushes. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64677,Cartman,"[preparing to dress as Irene] Alright, places everyone. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64679,Cartman,"[over the speakers] Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. [An opera box has been built to accommodate McMahon. It has four seats, and an usher takes McMahon and assistant to their seats. Vince has his own personal Playbill with ""WTF"" on the cover] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64686,Cartman,My man can do whatever he wants. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64688,Cartman,You're just gonna have to deal with that. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64691,Cartman,"My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64693,Cartman,"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64698,Cartman,You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64711,Cartman,"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64718,Cartman,"Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw. [The coach picks up the RPGL, puts it on his shoulder, and takes aim] We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64749,Cartman,"Hey, what about us? Our show? [the coach is now grinning as the two men walk away] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64752,Cartman,"This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64761,Cartman,"Oh, don't start with me, Kenny! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64763,Cartman,Kenny! I'm- 
13,11,Whale Whores,64796,Cartman," Can't read my, can't read my,  No he can't read my poker face.  She's got to love nobody.  Can't read my, can't read my,  No he can't read my poker face.  She's got to love nobody.  Papapa poker face papa poker face.  Mumumumuh.  Papapa poker face papa poker face.  Mumumumuh.   "
13,11,Whale Whores,64798,Cartman,What do you mean? This song is sweet. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64804,Cartman,"I'm not too busy, Stan. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64806,Cartman,"No, I just don't care. At all. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64809,Cartman,"[speaking into the mic] Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64811,Cartman, I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be. I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.   
13,11,Whale Whores,64898,Cartman,"Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! [his sweater has ""SAVE THE WHALES"" on it, while Kenny's parka now has ""DOLPHIN LOVER"" on it]. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64900,Cartman,What dude? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64902,Cartman,We always have. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64905,Cartman,That's not what we said. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64907,Cartman,We were talking about Wales the country. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64910,Cartman,[under his breath] Kenny! [to Stan] I deserve to be on TV. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64913,Cartman,"[popping up in front of the camera] All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! [grins and pumps a fist] "
13,11,Whale Whores,64925,Cartman,"Your show is fuckin' gay, dude! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64933,Cartman,"[gets emotional] Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like [sniff], we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64935,Cartman,"Shhh, Kenny... [the camera zooms in on Kenny, who's got his face in his hands] Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he- [flashes an angry look at the camera] Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though. [The camera pulls back to its previous position] Yeah, keep it there. [Cartman resumes his tale] He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64947,Cartman,"Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. [small plane engines are now heard. Cartman, Stan, and the others begin to look around] "
13,11,Whale Whores,64952,Cartman,"Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales. [the Japanese boats pulls up to the boys' location and stops.] Uh oh. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64954,Cartman," Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd Japanese prison got me down Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd Don't belong here, my eyes are round.   "
13,11,Whale Whores,64956,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64958,Cartman,"You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! [goes back to his song. Stan goes to the cell door and looks out]  I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd.  Japanese balls got me down. [a door opens somewhere and two prison guards walk towards the boys' cell]   "
13,11,Whale Whores,64963,Cartman,"Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go? "
13,11,Whale Whores,64970,Cartman,What dude? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64973,Cartman,Sorry. [clears his throat.] A little gassy. 'Scuse me. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64977,Cartman,So that's what this has all been about? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64979,Cartman,"Zzzzt zzzzsssht! [whispers aloud] Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out. "
13,12,The F Word,64994,Cartman,"Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind? "
13,12,The F Word,64999,Cartman,"God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of assholes on their Harley motorcycles show up?! [the bikers just cheer each other on, but the motors drown them out] "
13,12,The F Word,65001,Cartman,"Piss off, you stupid assholes! [the bikers ride off] "
13,12,The F Word,65021,Cartman,"[walking into view] Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes! [the bikers quiet down, turn off their motors, and look at him] You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right? "
13,12,The F Word,65023,Cartman,"You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right? "
13,12,The F Word,65026,Cartman,"No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. [proceeds to walk past the line of bikes] "
13,12,The F Word,65048,Cartman,But Cartman isn't letting up on him. [the bikers roll by and the boys stop playing] 
13,12,The F Word,65057,Cartman,Agreed. 
13,12,The F Word,65062,Cartman,"Ni-nice, okay. "
13,12,The F Word,65064,Cartman,What? 
13,12,The F Word,65071,Cartman,"I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats. "
13,12,The F Word,65073,Cartman,"[taking notes] Yeah, I think that'll be nice. "
13,12,The F Word,65075,Cartman,"I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy. "
13,12,The F Word,65099,Cartman,That was us! 
13,12,The F Word,65105,Cartman,"Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right? "
13,12,The F Word,65112,Cartman,"Oh, they think we meant gay fags. "
13,12,The F Word,65135,Cartman,"Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard? "
13,12,The F Word,65143,Cartman,"You call them ""bike-curious"". "
13,12,The F Word,65172,Cartman,"Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. [Kenny gets the ball and throws it to Stan, who dribbles it a bit and gets ready to shoot] "
13,12,The F Word,65186,Cartman,"Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country. "
13,12,The F Word,65193,Cartman,"Emmanuel Lewis, huh? "
13,12,The F Word,65213,Cartman,No! That'll just make you bigger fags! 
13,12,The F Word,65224,Cartman,"Oh it's over, it's finally over! [he and Kenny do a shoulder embrace. Stan walks up to the camera] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65255,Cartman,Oh. My. Goodddd. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65257,Cartman,"Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65260,Cartman,[cackles] He stutters like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag! [another boy walks up and sits in the chair to Cartman's right. Cartman notices immediately: the boy is well-dressed] Who are you? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65267,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, what's a moronic jizzrag? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65269,Cartman,Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece? [Mr. Mackey opens his office door to yell at Casey] 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65276,Cartman,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed in to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well. [reads the next announcement] For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger! [Wendy's mouth drops open] Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia! [Clyde has gone to sleep, half the class is getting sleepy, Stan buries his head in his arms] It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65278,Cartman,"But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65281,Cartman,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65283,Cartman,Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65285,Cartman,Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65287,Cartman,"You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65289,Cartman,"Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65291,Cartman,"Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field. [The first or second grade class is shown] I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions. [next day] Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school- [next day] And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that."" [next day] I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65294,Cartman,"- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole - "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65297,Cartman,"Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class, [The lights go down and a monitor is shown above Mr. Garrison's desk] you will see that the announcements are now being done in video. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65299,Cartman,"Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again. [exhales forcefully] Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back. [leaves his desk and walks over to a mobile blackboard] So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65301,Cartman,"I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why [writes Y on the board], we're gonna transform into something. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65322,Cartman,"""Thank you"" and this is to..? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65324,Cartman,"[signs a copy] ""To Douglas."" There you go. [gives it to him] Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65326,Cartman,Well hello. Another person who [looks to his right and tries to get the other kids' attention as they stream into the cafeteria] cares about the future of our school. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65328,Cartman,"Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65330,Cartman,That'll be five dollars. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65333,Cartman,A book signing. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65335,Cartman,I do not directly say she's a slut! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65337,Cartman,"[leans over the table and points something out to him] You didn't read the rest, dude. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65339,Cartman,"""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65353,Cartman,"You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65355,Cartman,"Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65357,Cartman,And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65359,Cartman,"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65361,Cartman,"Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! I'm walking out and I'm never coming back! [turns and storms out of the office.] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65364,Cartman,"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being allowed to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs. [an animated sequence begins. Smurf Village is shown] I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust. [one day he steps up, and they gather round him] It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. [they bring him a cap big enough to fit his head, he puts it on and grins. The camera pans up and the title of his animation appears: Dances with Smurfs] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65366,Cartman,"The smurfs and I grew to understand each other. [Cartman is now dressed as a Smurf, but only his face is painted blue. He's harvesting berries with the Smurfs] They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette. [He and the diminutive Smurfette sit on a log watching the sun set] We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65368,Cartman,"Papa Smurf was displeased at first, [Cartman tries to catch up to Smurfette as her father takes her into their mushroom house] He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65379,Cartman,"And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs! [Butters sobs] Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD. [holds up the DVD case] The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65402,Cartman,"Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65404,Cartman,People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65406,Cartman,Of course. That's why we're here. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65408,Cartman,"Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you. [sits down and gets his notes ready as the chimes come in] Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65410,Cartman,"Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65412,Cartman,"How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? [Wendy doesn't answer, and Cartman studies her reaction] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65414,Cartman,You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65418,Cartman,Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65420,Cartman,"If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? [Wendy doesn't answer] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65423,Cartman,You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65425,Cartman,"Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65427,Cartman,What? What do you mean I know that? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65429,Cartman,No! You wiped them all out! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65431,Cartman,"Wait, hold on, can we take a break? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65441,Cartman,"Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing- "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65443,Cartman,"No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65445,Cartman,You sold the movie rights to who?! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65447,Cartman,Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65449,Cartman,[crossing the street] Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes! [turns around and rants at the theater] You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA! [gives the theater two middle fingers three times] You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! [gives the theater two middle fingers three more times] 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65451,Cartman,Huh! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65453,Cartman,"No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65455,Cartman,"[""I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! [the chimes come on] ""]"
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65457,Cartman,"I'm doin' the best I can! [begins to cry, leaves his desk, and runs out of the classroom bawling.] "
13,14,Pee,65459,Cartman," We're going to the water park, The water park, the water park! We're going to the water park, Me and all my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like! [Kyle flashes a look of anger at him]    "
13,14,Pee,65461,Cartman,"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year. "
13,14,Pee,65463,Cartman,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities. "
13,14,Pee,65465,Cartman,"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off. "
13,14,Pee,65469,Cartman,"Come on, let's go! "
13,14,Pee,65472,Cartman,"[hands the clerk some money] Six adorable children, please. "
13,14,Pee,65474,Cartman,"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool! [finally gets to the wave pool, but gets pissed off] Oh, what the hell?! [the pool is quite crowded with people of all races enjoying themselves. The other five boys catch up to Cartman] "
13,14,Pee,65477,Cartman,[with a stunned look on his face] Forget it! Just forget it! [walks off in anger. The other five are confused] 
13,14,Pee,65499,Cartman," What has happened to this place? I don’t recognize it anymore. It used to be so fun and special. What is life worth living for? The dream is dead, our land is gone; There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go oooooon.  There are too many minorities (minorities) At my water park (my water park). This was our land, our dream (our dream), and they’ve taken it all away. They just keep coming and coming (minorities). I tried to go and tell the police, But even the authorities Are minorities At my water park.  There’s no place for me to sit anymore, And the lines just keep getting crazier. There are Mexicans all around me. The lazy river has never been lazier. It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide, And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!   "
13,14,Pee,65502,Cartman,Just do it in English! 
13,14,Pee,65504,Cartman," There are too many minorities (too many) At my water park (somebody do something). Where did they all come from? Why can’t they leave this land alone? And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying). We looked the other way too long. We’ve got to change our priorities And get all these minorities Out of my water park  (Minorities) Mexicans and Asians, (Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross). God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities Out of my water park (my water park).   "
13,14,Pee,65517,Cartman,"[running up to the boys] You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions! "
13,14,Pee,65519,Cartman,I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people! 
13,14,Pee,65521,Cartman,So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty-three! There are actually more minorities here than us! 
13,14,Pee,65523,Cartman,...What do you mean? 
13,14,Pee,65525,Cartman,The black and brown people. 
13,14,Pee,65527,Cartman,"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year! "
13,14,Pee,65529,Cartman,Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this! 
13,14,Pee,65531,Cartman,The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening! 
13,14,Pee,65534,Cartman,"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! [only Kyle is left at the table, and Cartman remembers this and slowly turns to him] Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan's prediction from coming true, buddy? "
13,14,Pee,65611,Cartman,Help! Help! 
13,14,Pee,65613,Cartman,"Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me! [grabs onto the branch and is hoisted onto the boat. He catches his breath] Oh, oh, oh. [sits up and looks around - it's all minorities in the boat] "
13,14,Pee,65615,Cartman,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you. "
13,14,Pee,65620,Cartman,"[pulls out a memo pad and pen and writes the following] Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what's on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live. [puts the pad and pen away somewhere...] Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. [the other survivors just look at him] "
13,14,Pee,65659,Cartman,"It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... [imagines himself in class with a bunch of non-white students] "
13,14,Pee,65661,Cartman,"I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie. "
13,14,Pee,65663,Cartman,...because I was so happy when I seen that movie. 
13,14,Pee,65665,Cartman,Noooo... [now imagines himself at a job interview] Trying to find a job will be even harder. 
13,14,Pee,65667,Cartman,"Well, I do just as much work. "
13,14,Pee,65669,Cartman,Noooo... [now imagines himself at an open council meeting] Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether. 
13,14,Pee,65673,Cartman,Noooo... 
13,14,Pee,65675,Cartman,"[throws down his pad and pen and stands up] NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! [turns away and squeezes his eyes shut.] "
13,14,Pee,65728,Cartman,Guys? Guys! [walks into view and hugs Stan] Oh it's true! You all did survive! 
13,14,Pee,65730,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived? "
13,14,Pee,65732,Cartman,"It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest! "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65759,Cartman,"[playing as Tiger] Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle walk into the store and spot the other two boys] "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65761,Cartman,"Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. [onscreen, Elin is chasing the SUV and leaving cracks in the rear windows with each swing of the club] "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65763,Cartman,"Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! [Cartman loses control of the SUV, which hits a fire hydrant, then a tree. Elin catches up to the SUV as Tiger opens the door and staggers out, a bit dazed. The radiator is letting out steam] "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65766,Cartman,"Oh dude, was that a combo move? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65768,Cartman,"Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65770,Cartman,"Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65849,Cartman,"I told you this game was sweet, dude. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65851,Cartman,"Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65854,Cartman,"Oh, you're going down, Elin! "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65857,Cartman,Oh no! [Elin continues beating up Tiger] Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65918,Cartman,"Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone?? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65977,Cartman,What the hell?! This game's all boring now! 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65979,Cartman,"Dude, screw this! [gets off the sofa and throws his controller to the floor, then walks away] Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,65983,Cartman,"[sarcastically, folds his arms together] Aww, books? God, I hate those! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,65985,Cartman,Oh really? Sweet. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,65991,Cartman,"Oho man, I can't wait! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,65993,Cartman,"No on, come on, let's read it now! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,65996,Cartman,"Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies?! Can we please read this right now?! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66004,Cartman,"Motherfucker! [Kyle turns around to face him, Stan stands up and walks up to him] The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"" "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66006,Cartman,"They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! [the door opens again and Kenny enters with his book] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66008,Cartman,"We know, we were just saying that. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66015,Cartman,"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66017,Cartman,"Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66021,Cartman,The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66024,Cartman,"It was a... a warm spring morning. [background music plays and a montage follows. Next is the school playground where, as other kids play, Stan and the other three sit on the steps of a side entrance and continue working on their book, with Cartman taking notes Next is Stan's room where Stan is typing the next part of the book. The boys are having fun with the writing. The next scene is in Cartman's room where Cartman is again writing the story down. Kyle has brought Ike over for company. Finally, a few days later, Sharon enters Stan's room to put away his clean clothes. She puts away some underwear but notices something in the drawer. Under Stan's shirts is the manuscript to the story the boys have been working on. Sharon reaches for it.] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66049,Cartman,"Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66051,Cartman,...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66054,Cartman,"And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66057,Cartman,"Butters, what are you up to? "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66063,Cartman,"Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66065,Cartman,"Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66071,Cartman,That's right. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66100,Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66108,Cartman,Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66114,Cartman,That inconsiderate jerk! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66140,Cartman,There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66148,Cartman,There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66171,Cartman,"All right you guys, I know what we have to do. [stands up and walks onto the street] We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66173,Cartman,"Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66175,Cartman,"Shhh. [addresses Ms. Parker] Be right with you. [hushed tones to the other boys] We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66177,Cartman,Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66179,Cartman,"[turns and walks over to Ms. Parker] Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. [Kenny follows.] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66189,Cartman,See any hunters yet? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66191,Cartman,"Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66195,Cartman,So what? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66198,Cartman,"Oh dude, sweet! [all four boys walk away, leaving Ms. Parker all alone at the mercy of any moose hunter that walks by her] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66205,Cartman,People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66209,Cartman,What?! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66215,Cartman,Oh come on! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66226,Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66233,Cartman,"That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66235,Cartman,[sighs heavily] You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66237,Cartman,"Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. [walks out of the room with the other boys] "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66241,Cartman,"[after ""27""] Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66243,Cartman,"[faking] I know, it sucks. [the coach blows his whistle as the boys reach ""40""] "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66245,Cartman,[grins and throws his sports bottle away] KFC!! [races for his ride] 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66247,Cartman,Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66249,Cartman,"Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you! [remembers where he is] Uhm sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole, Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66256,Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66273,Cartman,They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66278,Cartman,This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66295,Cartman,"Mom, drive faster! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66297,Cartman,Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66299,Cartman,WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66301,Cartman,Fuck you! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66303,Cartman,"No! No, what's going on?! [quickly gets out of the car and shoves a worker aside] Move aside! [stops at the front door and looks up again] "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66305,Cartman,"No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66307,Cartman,You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66309,Cartman,Nooooooooo-! [his head explodes] 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66315,Cartman,[looking fatigued and feeling quite itchy] I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. [sniffs heavily] 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66317,Cartman,[hops onto a little stool in front of the counter] Really? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66319,Cartman,"Whoa, what uh, are you serious? [fills out the application as she gets a treatment out of a cabinet. He turns around...] Oh my God, that's KFC gravy! [quite giddy] You have KFC! Yes! [she opens the gravy and pours some into a small cup, then slides the cup to him. He's disappointed] This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66321,Cartman,Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66323,Cartman,"[grabs it from her hand] NO! [swallows it as fast as he can] Oh God, oh God it's so good. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66347,Cartman,Yeah. Who isn't? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66349,Cartman,Billy Miller? Seriously?? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66352,Cartman,Tommy said you have some KFC. 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66354,Cartman,"Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce! [eats them as fast as he can] Oh God yes! [finishes it off] Where did you get that?! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66356,Cartman,85 bucks?? I don't have that! [three boys behind him get serious and approach him. One of them has a bat] 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66358,Cartman,How much KFC are we talking? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66360,Cartman,"Holy fuck, dude. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66362,Cartman,Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66368,Cartman,Are you Teabag? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66370,Cartman,Cut the crap. You got the stuff? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66372,Cartman,Extra crispy? [opens a small bowl of gravy and samples it carefully] 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66374,Cartman,You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66376,Cartman,IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! [reaches behind his back for a pistol and aims it at Teabag] 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66378,Cartman,You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money! 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66380,Cartman,"[lunges at him with the pistol, making him get on all fours] Like anybody wants KFC without gravy! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66383,Cartman,"Nothin', it's cool. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66398,Cartman,Yeah I got the stuff. [the other boys carry the bags away] And I got the money. [tosses the wad of bills back at Billy] 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66400,Cartman,"Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. [burps] "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66402,Cartman,Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66404,Cartman,Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66422,Cartman,"I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66424,Cartman,"Who? You mean Tommy? [looks over at Tommy, then stops walking. The Colonel stops as well - Tommy is missing.] Wait, where'd he go? "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66426,Cartman,"Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66428,Cartman,"Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66430,Cartman,Good. 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66450,Cartman,"[munching on a breast from a bucket] Will you relax, Billy? It's fine! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66452,Cartman,"[munching on a drumstick, his back to Billy] Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66454,Cartman,"...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66456,Cartman,I... [turns around to face Billy] told your mom you got an F on that social studies test. 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66458,Cartman,Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66460,Cartman,"Bye bye Billy. [Billy leaves] Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66478,Cartman,"Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66480,Cartman,"What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay. [leaves the throne] Put him on speaker. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66482,Cartman,"Colonel, how are you doing? "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66484,Cartman,"[rips the skin off a breast and lays it on the table] Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? [takes out a credit card and starts mincing the skin as if it were crack cocaine, into lines of finely ground skin] "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66486,Cartman,We had a little problem. 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66488,Cartman,"[snorts a line into his nose] Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that? "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66490,Cartman,"Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66492,Cartman,"Hey, take it easy Colonel. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66494,Cartman,"[grabs the phone] Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?! [hears someone breaking in and looks over his shoulder] Oh crap! [five men pour into the basement and start firing their machine guns at the boys, who scatter and try to escape. Two more men jump into the basement. More men outside the house begin firing their weapons. The police arrive and begin firing at the attackers] "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66511,Cartman,I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle! 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66513,Cartman,"'Cause people think I'm cool, dude. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66518,Cartman,[retorts] Stupid Facebook stuff. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66522,Cartman,"Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66524,Cartman,Surprise! [smiles] 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66529,Cartman,"Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66531,Cartman,"Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends. [begins to gloat] And he's had a profile for more than six months. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66593,Cartman,"[in a video podcast]  Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast! [Mad Friends podcast. Cartman sits behind a Mad Friends desk. At the bottom of the screen are two tickers. The upper one shows changes in friend stocks, the lower one shows Facebook updates] Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends! [rings a bell and leaves his chair] Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon. [presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast] You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? [shows a birthday cake] Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita. [presses a button that produces the sound of a whistle] If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street. [cranks up a player that repeats ""Word On The Street""] The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger [presses a robot that says ""MERGER""] So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66661,Cartman,"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66663,Cartman,"Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66665,Cartman,"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66668,Cartman,"Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66670,Cartman,"Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66672,Cartman,"Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66674,Cartman,"Okay let's, let's try this one. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66676,Cartman,"Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas. [goes onto the next person] Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66678,Cartman,This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66680,Cartman,"Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy... "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66682,Cartman,"Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66704,Cartman,Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off... [coughs to clear his throat] That's a dude jacking off... 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66706,Cartman,"Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle! [Kyle turns and goes back to Cartman's desk.] Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66708,Cartman,"Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too. "
14,5,200,66789,Cartman,"Wow, coo'... [snaps a picture] Chocolate rules! "
14,5,200,66791,Cartman,"AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew! "
14,5,200,66795,Cartman,"I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad. "
14,5,200,66800,Cartman,"Hey, that is Tom Cruise! [snaps a picture] "
14,5,200,66887,Cartman,"Excuse me... [the celebrities turn around] This is the home of Tom Cruise, right? "
14,5,200,66889,Cartman,I didn't come for myself. I'm just an escort for another celebrity who wants to get in on your lawsuit... 
14,5,200,66926,Cartman,"Wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money? "
14,5,200,66929,Cartman,"Uh, excuse us for a second... [walks away] "
14,5,200,66931,Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing? "
14,5,200,66933,Cartman,"Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money! "
14,5,200,66935,Cartman,"If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are... [looks at his hand, then removes his hand's hairpiece] Mitch Conner. "
14,5,200,66937,Cartman,"You're a no-good swindler and a too-good thief. We were here for money, not goo! "
14,5,200,66939,Cartman,"Yeah, so what? "
14,5,200,66941,Cartman,"So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves. "
14,5,200,66970,Cartman,No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez. 
14,5,200,66972,Cartman,You just had seven tacos. 
14,5,200,66974,Cartman,I'm sorry. [whisper] Why are you doing this? 
14,5,200,66976,Cartman,"[whispering] You know goddamn well you're not really Jennifer Lopez, now stop pissing me off! [Charlie Sheen steps forward] "
14,5,200,66979,Cartman,Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore! 
14,5,200,66981,Cartman,"No, I tried getting one last week! "
14,5,200,66983,Cartman,"God, will somebody shut her up? "
14,5,200,67004,Cartman,"I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. [Mitch goes in front of Cartman] "
14,5,200,67006,Cartman,Let me by... 
14,5,200,67008,Cartman,Screw this Conner. [pushes his hand away and moves on] Find yourself another partner. 
14,5,200,67010,Cartman,My father... 
14,5,200,67012,Cartman,"I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father. "
14,5,200,67014,Cartman,How could you know anything about who my family is? 
14,5,200,67016,Cartman,"If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, then you'd better- "
14,5,200,67065,Cartman,"Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father? "
14,5,200,67067,Cartman,I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat. 
14,5,200,67069,Cartman,I said GET. Mr. Hat! 
14,5,200,67071,Cartman,Put it on! [he puts it on] Do the voice. 
14,5,200,67077,Cartman,Keep... your hand... UP! 
14,5,200,67090,Cartman,"By who? Goddammit, Garrison, who is my father? "
14,6,201,67101,Cartman,That's right! Tell me the truth! Now! 
14,6,201,67150,Cartman,[quickly gets in] Ahaaa! 
14,6,201,67153,Cartman,"Nice work, Conner. "
14,6,201,67156,Cartman,"Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door! "
14,6,201,67187,Cartman,Them who?! 
14,6,201,67189,Cartman,Then start explaining it to me! 
14,6,201,67196,Cartman,No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is! 
14,6,201,67198,Cartman,It's all that matters! 
14,6,201,67200,Cartman,I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is! 
14,6,201,67222,Cartman,"Who you calling stupid, Jew? "
14,6,201,67237,Cartman,Gingers? No! 
14,6,201,67255,Cartman,Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I? 
14,6,201,67257,Cartman,"Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth? "
14,6,201,67259,Cartman,"Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. [a slow cackle rises from the darkness] "
14,6,201,67261,Cartman,Daddy? 
14,6,201,67263,Cartman,[strokes his chin and thinks] Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be. 
14,6,201,67265,Cartman,Scott Tenorman. Eeewww. 
14,6,201,67277,Cartman,What do you know?! 
14,6,201,67289,Cartman,Mom? 
14,6,201,67292,Cartman,Protect who?? 
14,6,201,67309,Cartman,My dad was a Denver Bronco? 
14,6,201,67311,Cartman,No- nooo. 
14,6,201,67317,Cartman,No! Noooo! 
14,6,201,67336,Cartman,Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means? 
14,6,201,67338,Cartman,My dad was a ginger! 
14,6,201,67340,Cartman,"I mean, obviously, I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me! "
14,6,201,67343,Cartman,What? 
14,6,201,67345,Cartman,Cheer up? I'm half ginger! 
14,6,201,67347,Cartman,"Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool. "
14,6,201,67350,Cartman,"Really, Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go? "
14,6,201,67352,Cartman,"Take it easy, Conner. [his hand floats away, then opens up all of a sudden. He wiggles his fingers. Next shot is of Tom Cruise sitting by himself on a trash can.] "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67555,Cartman,"[reads his note] Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67557,Cartman,"I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right? [clears his throat] The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- [Kyle walks over and rips the note from Cartman's hands] "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67559,Cartman,"I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?! "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67563,Cartman,"[takes his note back. Kyle walks back to his seat] You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society. [puts down that sheet, but reaches into his back pocket for another one] Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today? "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67584,Cartman,"If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. [puts the note on top of the pile and sits there quietly] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67640,Cartman,"[crying quietly] Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67642,Cartman,It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67644,Cartman,"I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! [buries his head in his lap and cries some more] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67646,Cartman,"Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67648,Cartman,"[sniffs] No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! [cries some more] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67650,Cartman,"[cynically, walks off a bit] Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver. [turns around and faces the boys] Look at me! [gestures to himself] Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? [turns away] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67652,Cartman,"[""No I can't I'll always be like this. [wipes tears away] ""]"
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67654,Cartman,"Come on you guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! [cries some more] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67656,Cartman,"I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67658,Cartman,"Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67660,Cartman,You love NASCAR huh? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67662,Cartman,"You see I told you guys! [turns and walks to his locker] What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! [puts his arm on the locker and rests his head on his arm] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67664,Cartman,"[lifts his head up] I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. [goes back to crying] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67666,Cartman,"Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67668,Cartman,"[stops crying and brightens up] You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. [smiles] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67670,Cartman,Then maybe I can make myself believe it too. [getting confident] Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.] 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67672,Cartman,Butters. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67674,Cartman,"Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up. [pumps both fists] I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and [pumps both fists] I'm psyched! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67676,Cartman,But [points his right index finger at him] I'm gonna need your help. [points both index fingers at him] Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get [pumps both fists twice] psyched up?? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67678,Cartman,"Get really psyched up, Butters! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67680,Cartman,"I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67682,Cartman,"I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters, [reaches to his left and pulls into view a water jug full of small change] Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67684,Cartman,"[points] Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back. [lowers his finger] From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67686,Cartman,"[points] I told you I'm serious, Butters. [lowers his finger] This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67700,Cartman,Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67702,Cartman,"I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67706,Cartman,Not yet. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67709,Cartman,"Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67711,Cartman,Fucking gross! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67715,Cartman,"[quickly rights himself and stands up] Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?! [clicks on the remote control to reverse it, then plays and echoes the commercial] ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss."" [clicks the remote to pause the playback] Oh my God, Butters... [makes a fist with his left hand] we need Vagisil! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67717,Cartman,"""Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."" "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67719,Cartman,"Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67721,Cartman,I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67723,Cartman,"Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here. [positions him] Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me. [As Butters keeps a look out, Cartman opens a tube of Vagisil anti-itch cream and begins to swallow it. Then he takes a bottle of wash and chugs that down, following that up with two more tubes, then more products] Is anybody coming? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67725,Cartman,"Mm, 'kay, Mm. [throws the bottle away] N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... [grabs a tube of maximum strength anti-itch cream] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67727,Cartman,Oh my God! Butters! [taps Butters' shoulder and Butters turns around] I feel kind of stupid! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67729,Cartman,"Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67731,Cartman,Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67738,Cartman,"[walks towards the car] Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! [puts on the helmet and climbs into the car] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67740,Cartman,"[Swallows another tube of Vagisil] Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67742,Cartman,"Let's go NASCAR! [the other drivers zoom past him. He steers the wheel, but realizes] I'm not moving, Butters. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67744,Cartman,What's that? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67746,Cartman,"Oh okay. [leans down to press it. He burns rubber and takes off, as ""La Grange"" by ZZ Top plays] Let's go NASCAR! [he immediately crashes into the wall and tries to power out of it. Suddenly, he turns left and goes back the other way] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67748,Cartman,"Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! [the other drivers round the corner and avoid him. Car #78 crashes through the wall and plows up the bleachers. Cartman tries to turn around but goes up into the air and into the pit area. Everyone there gets out of the way. He hits a low wall and goes up into the air again...] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67749,Cartman,"[abash] Oh, fuck my ass! [he lands in a lake by the Winners Circle.] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67752,Cartman,All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67754,Cartman,[looks away] Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67756,Cartman,I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67761,Cartman,"Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67763,Cartman,Aw donkey balls... 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67765,Cartman,"Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67768,Cartman,Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67770,Cartman,"Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. [Butters brightens up] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67778,Cartman,"Oh hey, Kenny! [Kenny is not happy and his arms are crossed] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67780,Cartman,"Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on. [Kenny follows him in. Cartman shows him all the stuff he purchased - a jet ski, a Room-bot, a 7.1 speaker system, a plasma TV, an LCD monitor, a VHS/DVD combo player] Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? [Kenny is still pissed off] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67782,Cartman,"Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67784,Cartman," [annoyed] Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67786,Cartman,"Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67788,Cartman,"I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do! [Kenny raises his fists up, but Cartman hugs him with one arm] Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67790,Cartman,Yeah? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67792,Cartman,...Uh oh. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67794,Cartman,"Awww, sweet! [runs to the car, then runs his right hand over the body] No way, this is so tits! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67796,Cartman,"Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67799,Cartman,"Aww coool, huh Kenny? [Makes engine revving and shift change noises] I got a NASCAR, Kenny! [Geoff looks at Kenny, smiling] So awesome, huh Kenny? [Kenny can only look on angrily] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67804,Cartman,"[doing a redneck accent and acting completely stupid] Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67807,Cartman,"Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67809,Cartman,"Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67811,Cartman,"Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67814,Cartman,"Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67818,Cartman,"Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'... [holds up a bottle] Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme. [squeezes some out and rubs it all over his lips] Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline! [spits into a can] What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell! [Kenny buries his face in the counter, in shame. On screen, Butters appears behind Cartman] You all know my pit boss, Butters. [Butters appears over by the grill, also with a mouthful of Vagisil] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67820,Cartman,He's fuckin' gay as hell! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67822,Cartman,"[dips again and rubs it on his lips] So y'all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67833,Cartman,"Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67844,Cartman,"[in the redneck accent] Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward. [does so and rear-ends #78, then back up and swerves onto the track and sideswipes #95 and #78] NASCAR! Yee-ah! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67846,Cartman,"Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! [hits the brakes and #7 runs into him. Danica Patrick is the driver] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67848,Cartman,"[gives her the middle finger] Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! [steps on the gas and peels away. Other cars pass Danica, whose engine is now on fire] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67850,Cartman,"Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67857,Cartman,"Oh yeah, I see it. [Cartman avoids the car, but runs over Danica, who was trying to make it across the track to the field inside] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67859,Cartman,"[looks over his right shoulder, then faces forward again] You see that? Daynicuh Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67861,Cartman,"Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left. [turns the steering wheel hard to the left and drives through the drivers' eating area and the pedestrians all running and screaming, Cartman ran over most of them and some survived by running from the side] Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang! ""[Cartman made it back on the track]"" "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67863,Cartman,"I'm back own the track. [An enraged Kenny makes his way down the bleacher steps towards the track. He jumps onto the track and lands on the Vagisil car. He turns around on the car roof and looks into the car through the windshield, Cartman also enraged as well] What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67865,Cartman,"[irked] Get off my car, Kenny! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67868,Cartman,"We're tradin' paint! [further down the track he hits two other cars, which then slammed into each other. Back to Cartman, he's furious] Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67870,Cartman,"[determined and angered] Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brake! Bye Kenny. [steps on the brakes, launching Kenny at the end of the track] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67882,Cartman,"Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67884,Cartman,"Fuckin' gay as hell. [Patty pulls up to his left, taps him a bit, then pulls away.] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67887,Cartman," [Shocked] Oh, fuck my ass again! [...and crashes upside down into the outer wall. Patty goes onto the finish line, getting the victory for Jimmie Johnson] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67894,Cartman,"No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. [Kenny is confused] I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67896,Cartman,[livid] The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67898,Cartman,"Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67944,Cartman,"You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67946,Cartman,"Oops, busted. [avoids eye contact] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67949,Cartman,"Aw, crap, there's more of them? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67997,Cartman,"You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67999,Cartman,"[takes the ball from Kenny and confronts Kyle] Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68001,Cartman,"Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68003,Cartman,So what?! That makes you from Jersey! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68005,Cartman,"[turns around] He's from Jersey, you guys. [inches away] Let's just get away from him. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68007,Cartman,"Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68010,Cartman,"You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68015,Cartman,"[moves Kyle aside] Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68017,Cartman,"Yes, it is. It's getting oranger. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68020,Cartman,"Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you. [walks away, then turns and glares at him] And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68056,Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68058,Cartman,[points to Kyle] And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68060,Cartman,"Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68062,Cartman,"Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68064,Cartman,"[Whining] That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the treeee! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it! [Stan and Kenny walk away silently] Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68092,Cartman,"So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68094,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler. [Kyle is cleaning his rifle nearby and lifts his head to see what the other boys are doing] Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh? [Kyle returns to cleaning his rifle. Cartman then moves to the opposite side of the circle] He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68096,Cartman,"This is very serious, Butters. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68098,Cartman,"Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?! [Kyle looks up again. Cartman notices and turns to look back at him] Hey, Kyle. [stretches] Uhh... Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh. [turns around and goes into a low voice as Kyle watches from nearby] We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68104,Cartman,"Come on, you guys, hurry! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68106,Cartman,"I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68108,Cartman,"[leads them to a spot] Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool. [stops] It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68110,Cartman,"Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68112,Cartman,"Nuh-uh. Seriously, nuh-uh. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68114,Cartman,"Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights! [the lights go on and the fourth graders Cartman was talking to earlier pop into view] Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! [the group of six come up and take Kyle away] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68116,Cartman,"[stops Stan and Kenny in their tracks] Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. [rushes up to the freezer door] Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68118,Cartman,"Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68120,Cartman,You ginger Jersey Jew! [Snooki rises up behind him] Your tactics don't work on me! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68122,Cartman,"[looks over his shoulder, then looks back at the other boys] Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68147,Cartman,What does it want?! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68150,Cartman,"No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68159,Cartman,"[Sniffling] Thank you, Kyle. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68170,Cartman,"Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster. [Pinches Kyle's cheek] But you're my little monster. "
14,10,Insheeption,68177,Cartman,"So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. [laughs heartily. Butters approaches the table with a sheet of paper] "
14,10,Insheeption,68183,Cartman,"[voice rising in pitch] Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk."", you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68672,Cartman,I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives? 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68674,Cartman,"I need to speak with him, please. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68676,Cartman,"I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68679,Cartman,"Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people, [sets his briefcase on the table and opens it] and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news. [takes out an application to join Coon and Friends and hands it to Hindsight] You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68681,Cartman,"I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68691,Cartman,"[waits a few seconds, then] ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68693,Cartman,"Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab! "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68695,Cartman,"[gathers the form and puts it back in the briefcase] Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! [walks away] "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68808,Cartman,[voice over] Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them. 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68809,Cartman,Asshoooles! [leaps out of window] 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69348,Cartman,"[sarcastic] Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. [the line moves forward and the boys enter to see... Randy as the school chef] "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69356,Cartman,Lobster foam? [Stan shuts his eyes and buries his nose in his right hand] It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day! 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69411,Cartman,"[on stilts, dressed as Ramsay] Oy! Bebebebebebebe. "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69416,Cartman,"Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69435,Cartman,"[still dressed as Ramsay] What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69437,Cartman,"Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69494,Cartman,"Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys? [Bebe walks by, and Cartman jumps up to approach her] Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough! [laughs at her, and she walks off disgusted. Tolkien walks by] Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Tolkien? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich! [Tolkien walks on, but is puzzled by Cartman's behavior. Cartman sees four kids playing four-square and jeers at them] Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads! [checks his iPad and starts pacing] Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps! [smiles. Craig comes up behind him] This is so awesome! [Craig taps him on the shoulder and Cartman turns around] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69496,Cartman,[stares at him for a second] What? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69498,Cartman,Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! [looks around again] 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69500,Cartman,"Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! [Craig looks off into the distance, surprised] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69502,Cartman,"No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69504,Cartman,"I left my charger at home! [the boys are still waiting] Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! [walks away angrily] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69506,Cartman,"Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69508,Cartman,"YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to FUCK me! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69562,Cartman,"Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69564,Cartman,I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69566,Cartman,"Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you? "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69568,Cartman,"Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69570,Cartman,Toshiba Handibook? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69572,Cartman,"Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69574,Cartman,"[looks at her for a second] Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69576,Cartman,"You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?! [everyone is now staring at the two of them] Just say so! Go ahead! Here! [pulls down his pants to moon his mom, who puts her hands over her mouth] Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69579,Cartman,[sniffles] But I told you I was sorry. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69581,Cartman,I wasn't trying to get you in trouble. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69583,Cartman,"[looks around for something to come back with] Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Mama. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69585,Cartman,"[sniffles] Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook? "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69587,Cartman,Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! [bangs at the dashboard with his fists] 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69648,Cartman,Yes! She fucks me so hard! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69650,Cartman,"Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69653,Cartman,At Best Buy. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69656,Cartman,Uh huh. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69658,Cartman,Yes! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69660,Cartman,No! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69662,Cartman,"Oh, there she is! There's my mom right now! [Dr. Phil crosses his arms] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69664,Cartman,Booooooo! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69669,Cartman,"She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday... "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69671,Cartman,"You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69675,Cartman,[suddenly bright with hope] An iPad??? [dances in his chair] 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69742,Cartman,"Whoa! Cooool! [struts over to it, then presses some icons on the iPhone on Junichi's forehead.] Oh wooow! No waaay! [walks to the iPad on the woman's ass and presses some icons there.] It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69766,Cartman,"Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69770,Cartman,"What?! Hey, that's mine! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69776,Cartman,"Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! [a bolt of lightning strikes Cartman and the power goes out] "
15,2,Funnybot,69780,Cartman,What's this? 
15,2,Funnybot,69830,Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy! [runs up behind him, with the other three boys] Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?! "
15,2,Funnybot,69833,Cartman,"Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle! "
15,2,Funnybot,69838,Cartman,Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy! 
15,2,Funnybot,69847,Cartman,"Ugh, let me talk to them. [walks up to the President Wulff] "
15,2,Funnybot,69849,Cartman,"Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. [""Look, this whole thing is a mistake.""] "
15,2,Funnybot,69851,Cartman,"Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. [""We don't care about the Comedy Award thing. It was the special education kids. They made us choose.""] "
15,2,Funnybot,69853,Cartman,"Dürfen wir der Kind dort.. [walks up to Kyle] ...geboten? [""We can offer the child... here.""] Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. [""He's a Jew. Eh? A handsome soft Jew. He's freeesh. And beauuutiful, beauuutiful.""] "
15,2,Funnybot,69855,Cartman,"[sighs] Well, I tried. "
15,2,Funnybot,69889,Cartman,"Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""? "
15,2,Funnybot,69891,Cartman,"He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat."" "
15,2,Funnybot,69895,Cartman,"Tolkien, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away! "
15,2,Funnybot,69899,Cartman,"Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler. "
15,2,Funnybot,69918,Cartman,"Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. [a burly guard stands by the door] "
15,2,Funnybot,69948,Cartman,"It's kind of funny, you guys. "
15,2,Funnybot,69962,Cartman,"[runs up to Funnybot and tries to pull him from the mainframe] Stop it now! Ugh- [is zapped enough to pull away. He turns and walks back to the boys] No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism. "
15,2,Funnybot,69964,Cartman,Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world? 
15,2,Funnybot,69968,Cartman,Paradox... 
15,2,Funnybot,69992,Cartman,[cryptically] Or will there be? 
15,3,Royal Pudding,70157,Cartman,My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70168,Cartman,[storms into the cafeteria and walks towards the table] Goddamnit!!! [Butters sits back down] Who the fuck do they think they are?! [arrives and starts pacing back and forth] This is the last fucking straw!!! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!!! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70170,Cartman,[begins to rattle the table] I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!!! [Butters groans as Cartman shakes the table. Cartman soon stops] This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!!!! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70172,Cartman,"No, I didn't do a damn thing!!! Nothing!!! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES!!! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!!! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70174,Cartman,"Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, huh?! No!!! Not this time!!! [flies into a rage again and rattles the table] The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!!! [the other boys look at each other] You remember the school physical we all took last week?! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70176,Cartman,"Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!!! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70178,Cartman,"Yeah they fucking did, Kyle!!! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70180,Cartman,"Because they don't fucking care!! I've told you this!! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70182,Cartman,Go look for yourselves!!! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70184,Cartman,"There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70186,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""! [turns around and faces the other boys] Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70193,Cartman,"No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.2 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70195,Cartman,"They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70197,Cartman,"Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70199,Cartman,"[measures, then writes down the result on his notepad] Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches. [Clyde zips up and turns around] You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70201,Cartman,"Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next? [Butters walks up and gets on the stool] Whip it out, Butters. [Butters drops his pants and briefs] "
15,4,T.M.I.,70203,Cartman,"Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70205,Cartman,"Butters, I don't have time for this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70207,Cartman,"Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70209,Cartman,"Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers. [walks towards the door with Butters, Tolkien and Craig, but their way is blocked by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.] What? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70211,Cartman,"What, Kyle? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70213,Cartman,I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. [points to his measurement] 
15,4,T.M.I.,70215,Cartman,"Yeah, it's pretty good. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70218,Cartman,Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70220,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! [goes to get measured by his peers.] "
15,4,T.M.I.,70225,Cartman,"There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4! [The two girls leave and Red walks by] What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care! [wanders about approaching random girls] Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70227,Cartman,"Oh, Goddamnit! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70229,Cartman,Let me guess: I'm in trouble again! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70231,Cartman,For what?! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70233,Cartman,Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70235,Cartman,"I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!!! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70237,Cartman,"You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's 0.2 inches bigger than you said!!! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70239,Cartman,What? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70241,Cartman,Those weren't our dick sizes? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70243,Cartman,I don't know! Why would you?! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70245,Cartman,[gets off the chair and walks off] Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70247,Cartman,Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70249,Cartman,Fuck you! No I don't! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70254,Cartman,"Honestly, I wouldn't really care. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70258,Cartman,[coldly] I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70281,Cartman,Why the fuck am I here?! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70283,Cartman,Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70285,Cartman,"Oh, that's cool. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70316,Cartman,My penis is 13 inches long. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70334,Cartman,Yeah dude! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70337,Cartman,"[takes his chair and swings it against a wall, where it shatters] Yeah! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70345,Cartman,"Burn it down, dude! [Daniel demolishes boxes with a bat while Gretchen takes a pipe to other boxes. Michael holds a knife and kicks some boxes while Cartman takes a small hammer to a huge box. Wayne D fires away with a pistol while Chase fires away with a semi-automatic rifle and Tuong Lu Kim swings a Chinese cleaver around ] "
15,4,T.M.I.,70353,Cartman,The Jews! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70363,Cartman,"No, and fuck Kyle! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70392,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70401,Cartman,"Wait, what? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70404,Cartman,"[runs outside and tries to get their attention] Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener! "
15,4,T.M.I.,70406,Cartman,I'm still fucking angry! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70432,Cartman,Oh. Hey Kyle. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70434,Cartman,I'm volunteering. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70436,Cartman,"[firmly] I'm volunteering my time, Kyle. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70439,Cartman,"I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?! [to the nurse] Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. [walks away] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70447,Cartman,"Ah, crap! [rolls his eyes] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70449,Cartman,"Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70451,Cartman,"What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70453,Cartman,"Crack baby basketball. [Kyle pushes his chair away from the table, gets up, and begins to leave] Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us! [Kyle reaches the staurs] We could actually really use you! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70455,Cartman,"Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping. [Kyle heads downstairs] Dammit! [Kyle leaves the building; Cartman races down the stairs to catch up to him] Kyle, wait I- [Kyle slams the door shut and walks away. Cartman opens it and catches up to Kyle] Kyle, hold on a second! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70457,Cartman,"What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70459,Cartman,"We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. [Kyle stops walking, then turns around] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70461,Cartman,"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70463,Cartman,"Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70466,Cartman,"After you. [the other four enter. Inside, it is packed with people waiting for a table to open.] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70469,Cartman,Come on. [the other boys follow] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70472,Cartman,We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70475,Cartman,"It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70477,Cartman,"Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70480,Cartman,"We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70483,Cartman,"You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. [Kyle is about to give in, but still has his doubts. He look down and away] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70486,Cartman,"Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70488,Cartman,"Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. [pats Kyle on the shoulder and walks away. Kyle walks back to the window and looks out over the street below. He smiles] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70499,Cartman,Betsy MacIntosh? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70501,Cartman,We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70503,Cartman,"We need to speak with you, ma'am. [she allows them to come in, and they sit on the sofa while she sits in the armchair.] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70505,Cartman,And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70507,Cartman,"[looks at Butters and smiles] Well ma'am, I have some exciting news. [takes his briefcase and opens it, taking out a letter] We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. [Butters claps in approval] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70509,Cartman,"We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70511,Cartman,[holds out a pen] Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70513,Cartman,"Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70515,Cartman,"I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the- "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70517,Cartman,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? [Butters smiles, reaches for his briefcase, and opens it] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70525,Cartman,It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70527,Cartman,"[slams his fists on the table] Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now! [a shot of Slash on the TV on the wall] Now you guys get down there- [the phone rings] Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go! [Craig and Clyde turn around and leave] Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well. [As Clyde and Craig go downstairs, Kyle comes upstairs. Kyle looks pissed as he stops at Cartman's desk] Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too. [softly] Hey Kyle. Have a seat. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70529,Cartman,"Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye. [hangs up] How's it goin', man? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70531,Cartman,They can't make money. It's against the rules. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70533,Cartman,"Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70535,Cartman,"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70537,Cartman,"We're a non-profit company, Kyle. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70539,Cartman,"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. [shows him to the newest addition to the office] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70541,Cartman,"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. [Kyle goes up the steps, dips his finger into the liquid, and tastes it] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70543,Cartman,Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70545,Cartman,"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime? [pretty soon they're both in the hot tub. A lot of McDonald's french fries sit behind them.] Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutine"". "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70547,Cartman,It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70552,Cartman,[speaking like a Georgia plantation owner] Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70554,Cartman,"My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself, [opens a humidor and takes out a cigar] I am also in the slave trade. [takes a long whiff of the sealed cigar, then puts it into his inside coat pocket and pats it down] But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70556,Cartman,"[walks over to a picture of the UCB basketball team] You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70558,Cartman,"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70560,Cartman,"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70562,Cartman,"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight. [clears his throat] Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu. [waits a few seconds, then takes off his hat and softly says] Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70564,Cartman,"You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?! [walks towards the entrance and opens the door] This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! [walks out and closes the door] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70570,Cartman,"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70572,Cartman,How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70574,Cartman,"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70576,Cartman,"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime! [slams the receiver down on the base] Jesus Christ! [Kyle walks in with a stand and some schematics] Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70578,Cartman,...What? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70580,Cartman,"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70582,Cartman,"This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! [hugs Kyle, who is quite puzzled at Cartman's reaction] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70607,Cartman,What? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70611,Cartman,Vunter Slash? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70613,Cartman,"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70615,Cartman,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70617,Cartman,Are you fucking serious? [no one speaks for a few seconds] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70619,Cartman,You knew about this?? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70629,Cartman,"I just can't believe Slash isn't real, "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70632,Cartman,"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70644,Cartman,"[pops into view] He is real, you guys. [a constellation of Slash appears among the stars. Cartman winks and drops down from view] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70882,Cartman,"Alright now, open presents! Open presents! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70884,Cartman,Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70886,Cartman,Yaaaay! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70889,Cartman,[eagerly opening his own gift] What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70893,Cartman,"Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox! [Speed Zone for XBOX 360] D'you guys see that? Coool, huh? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70896,Cartman,"Stan's getting another present, Mom. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70898,Cartman,"Yaaaay! [rips the wrapper off] Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70906,Cartman,"Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70954,Cartman,Turn it off dude! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70964,Cartman,"Oh yeah, that one's cool. [gets into the rhythm] Yeah, this part's killer. [looks like he's exercising] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71025,Cartman,"Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71028,Cartman,"He's lying, dude. Hit X "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71033,Cartman,What's that? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71037,Cartman,"Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71048,Cartman,Look like ice cream to me. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71076,Cartman,"...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. [Cartman and Kenny turn and walk away. Stan approaches Kyle] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71092,Cartman,"Oh cool, the movie trailers! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71100,Cartman,That looks pretty good. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71106,Cartman,"Stan, knock it off! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71115,Cartman,"No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71119,Cartman,"Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! [he and Kenny leave. Kyle stays behind] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71160,Cartman,"Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again! [at this point Stan stops and stands alongside the other boys, but he's still looking at the ground] But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71162,Cartman,Yep! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71164,Cartman,Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71166,Cartman,Wait what? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71168,Cartman,"Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71170,Cartman,You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71172,Cartman,"Okay, you're on, Jew! [he and Kenny follow Kyle away. Several seconds later, the bus shows up and Stan gets on. He takes an empty seat and no one sits next to him. He leans against the window, looking very sad] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71178,Cartman,Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? [Stan is hearing everything as if from a distance] 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71182,Cartman,"That's right, it's a butt fungus. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71202,Cartman,Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow- 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71205,Cartman,[coughing somewhat] Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71207,Cartman,"Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71209,Cartman,I-I'll try. I'll try. [lays on his stomach. The nurse sees something under his pants and pulls them back.] 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71211,Cartman,A what?? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71213,Cartman,Are you serious? How can there be- [sighs] Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers?? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71215,Cartman,"What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71217,Cartman,Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71228,Cartman,[rounds a corner and walks past Wendy and Kyle] Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71230,Cartman,[stops and backs up] I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71232,Cartman,Really? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71236,Cartman,"Gee, thanks Kyle! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71255,Cartman,"Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71257,Cartman,"There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71259,Cartman,"How are we doing on those patties, Jew? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71261,Cartman,Nice! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71263,Cartman,It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71265,Cartman,"I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers. [Kyle may have noticed, but he doesn't say anything about the burgers stuffed down behind Cartman's ass and legs. Cartman goes into the booth, and moments later comes out with a fresh batch of finished burgers] Alright, these are good to go! [More kids have gathered. Among them are Esther, Heidi, Red, Bill, and Tommy.] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71301,Cartman,"Everything alright here, Kyle? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71303,Cartman,We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71356,Cartman,"Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71402,Cartman,The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! [they walk back out and away.] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71405,Cartman,"[turns around] Alright, y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready. [spits something out, wipes his lips clean with the back of his shirt sleeve, and returns to patrolling the border] There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71407,Cartman,"Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah! [turns to the boys on the ground - Clyde, Craig, and Timmy] All right, patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71416,Cartman,[robot voice] Scanning for Mexicans. [more sound effects] Oh! [spots Kyle coming out of the woods] We've got a Mexican! [Clyde and Craig take up posts] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71418,Cartman,"[to the other boys] He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid. [to Kyle] Ha ha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71420,Cartman,"Hey! Just because I'm Texan, it doesn't mean I'm fat! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71422,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well, you're a fuckin' Jew, Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew! [Stan sneaks in past a cardboard box labelled ""Christmas Ornaments""] Let's just see you try and-! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71424,Cartman,Clyde?! [descends from his perch atop the border and goes to Clyde] What the fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71426,Cartman,"Ugh, yeah?! Well, you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit! [Tolkien appears at the other end of the border and hops over] If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71428,Cartman,"Dude!! [walks over to Craig] How did he get past the fence, Craig?! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71430,Cartman,"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! [Jimmy walks by in the foreground] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71432,Cartman,"Oh, God! [throws down his hat] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71439,Cartman,I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71441,Cartman,"At least I have an asshole, Kyle! [the boys laugh] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71462,Cartman,"[talking in his sleep] No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got... [wakes up] Butters! [gets up, then tries to get the others up] Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71464,Cartman,Where is Butters? 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71472,Cartman,"[puts on his ranger hat, now speaking in his Texan voice] All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through! [walks towards the woods, but stops long enough to tell Kyle] You haven't won yet! [smiles evilly and moves on] Game on! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71553,Cartman,"You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71555,Cartman,"You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71557,Cartman,"Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?[The news come back on, with Cartman glancing at his TV, with Kyle also staring, as Stan continues glaring at Cartman] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71559,Cartman,Oh dude. Sweet. 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71568,Cartman,This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet. 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71574,Cartman,Cartman. Eric T. Cartman. 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71583,Cartman,"[robot voice] No Mexicans detected. [normally] Huh, nothing. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71590,Cartman,"Wait a minute, isn't that... "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71592,Cartman,[squints his eyes] Oh no you don't! [takes Officer 2's sidearm and fires at Butters.] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71595,Cartman,"That asshole is not getting across my border! [Butters either fails to see the open gate, or it was closed while Cartman was firing at him, because he starts climbing the fence. Cartman quickly gets down to intercept him, but decides that electrocuting the fence would get Butters off it, and it works] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71597,Cartman,[gives chase] No you won't Butters! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71603,Cartman,Ey! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71607,Cartman,"¡Respeto mi autóridad! [""Respect mah authoritah!"" Again, Cartman is fired upon, and his boat begins to sink. This time, the border patrol is in a helicopter firing away] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71611,Cartman,"Where the fuck did he go?! [in the background, Butters can be seen riding by on his burro. Cartman sees him and gives chase. Just before Cartman reaches him, Butters blinks. Cartman jumps off his ATV and tackles Butters off his burro, and they both end up on the desert ground, with Cartman on top] Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose! [Butters apparently collapses] The fuck is this?! [instead of seeing the real Butters, Cartman sees a life-size piñata of him. The head separates from the body and candy falls out] No. NO! [Butters is climbing the fence] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71613,Cartman,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! [Butters goes over the border fence and jumps down] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71620,Cartman,"I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you, Kyle! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71625,Cartman,[sighs gruffly and rolls his eyes] A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar... 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71627,Cartman,"YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys! [runs up to Butters, Kenny, Stan, and Kyle] You're never gonna guess what! [stands among them] Seriously you guys, guess what?? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71629,Cartman,"You guys, you know Pete Melman? [no one answers] Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71631,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, Pete Melman! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71633,Cartman,"He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! [begins to cackle] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71635,Cartman,"Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71638,Cartman,"Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper? [whips out an iPhone and starts looking for the Eavesdropper article] It's a Web site about all the students in the school! [The web site screams ""Exclusive! Pete Melman Craps Pants At School!"" at you. Part of the page has a picture of Pete on there, with a 'play' button to play a recording] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71640,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys! [gets back to his phone] Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom. [touches the 'play' button] Just listen, listen listen. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71646,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! [laughs. Craig moves on] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71649,Cartman,"Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman."" "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71651,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, what now?! [goes to the office] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71654,Cartman,"Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! [slaps the table and laughs] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71656,Cartman,"Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71658,Cartman,"[smiles] Yeah, he killed himself. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71660,Cartman,Hey! Whoooa. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71662,Cartman,"'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71665,Cartman,You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71667,Cartman,"Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71669,Cartman,[scoff] Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71671,Cartman,You aren't listing to anythin- [checks himself] Make it worth my while how? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71681,Cartman,"Uh, hey Jenny. 'Sup? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71683,Cartman,"Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71685,Cartman,"So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Uh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. [takes out a box of cupcakes from his backpack] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71687,Cartman,I was just thinking that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of... [gulps] liked you. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71689,Cartman,"I know. Uh, I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake? [getting uncomfortable, he puts the cupcake in the box and the box away in his back pack] Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. [walks quickly away] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71695,Cartman,"[concerned, while Mr. Garrision is talking] You okay, Jenny? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71697,Cartman,"Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. [Jenny moans even more] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71701,Cartman,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71703,Cartman,"Well, just give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71706,Cartman,"Oh, my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants! [Millie, Tolkien, and Wendy leave] Did you guys hear that?! Oh, my God! [Kyle and Clyde leave] It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71708,Cartman,WAY worse! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71712,Cartman,"Alright, kewl. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71714,Cartman,"You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simons crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! [shows them the story on his iPhone] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71716,Cartman,"Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71718,Cartman,"Jesus Christ! [thinks hard] Okay, okay. [squeezes his eyes shut, puts his hands over them, removes the right hand] Um, Jesus- [removes the left hand] ah... Okay, look. [the adults lean in a bit] Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71720,Cartman,"Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you... [turns his head left for a moment, still hasn't opened his eyes] you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. [Victoria, Adler, and Mackey just stare at him] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71722,Cartman,"Okay, well, if you have a better idea, then why am I here? [Mr. Adler looks at Principal Victoria, Principal Victoria looks at Mr. Mackey, Mr. Mackey places a call.] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71789,Cartman,"Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71791,Cartman,"Yeah, I think they're all ready. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71793,Cartman,It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71795,Cartman,"Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?! [leaves the preparation table and faces them] I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71797,Cartman,Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You [gasp] you actually got her to come! [grins] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71799,Cartman,"No thanks. Okay, proceed. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71802,Cartman,That. Was. Amazing. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71896,Cartman,"Boy, I say. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71898,Cartman,It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71900,Cartman,"Oh, you're most certainly welcome. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71902,Cartman,"Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71904,Cartman,[softly] I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those. 
15,11,Broadway Bro Down,71959,Cartman,Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach! 
15,12,1%,72231,Cartman,"Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. [The other kids are not amused] "
15,12,1%,72233,Cartman,"Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. [Kenny climbs down and Kyle approaches] "
15,12,1%,72235,Cartman,"Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope? "
15,12,1%,72237,Cartman,"Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us. "
15,12,1%,72240,Cartman,"Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip. "
15,12,1%,72242,Cartman,Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%! 
15,12,1%,72244,Cartman,Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me! 
15,12,1%,72248,Cartman,"Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl. "
15,12,1%,72250,Cartman,"I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault. "
15,12,1%,72252,Cartman,"What do you mean, Peter Panda? "
15,12,1%,72255,Cartman,Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back. 
15,12,1%,72260,Cartman,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! [slams a door, but it doesn't close. Cartman walks out] "
15,12,1%,72277,Cartman,"Mom, have you been here all day?! "
15,12,1%,72279,Cartman,Somebody's been in my room! [she looks up at him as he goes back to his room. He looks under his things to see if anything is missing. His mom appears at the door] Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?! 
15,12,1%,72281,Cartman,Am I sure?? Look at this place! 
15,12,1%,72283,Cartman,"[turns around and glares at her] Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me! [goes back to searching his stuff and finds a watch] They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch... [finds a video game] My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have- [looks at a corner of his room. A chair set apart for Clyde Frog is empty, but his other four dolls are arranged and seated in from of it.] Oh my God. [panicking] Clyde Frog! "
15,12,1%,72285,Cartman,"No. [goes to the corner and tosses his dolls aside, then looks up in despair] NOOO! [runs to his closet and looks in there. He doesn't find Clyde Frog in there] CLYDE FROG!! [stops to tell him mom] They took Clyde Frog! [runs out of his room. Liane is confused] "
15,12,1%,72287,Cartman,"[calling out and walking around] Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?! [stops and notices something on a tree. It is Clyde Frog, nailed to a tree through his front paws and forehead. It's ripped all over and cotton pops out of the rips. Under the frog is the word ""VENGEANCE"" scratched onto the tree bark in red spray paint] Clyde. CLYDE FROG! [throws up] "
15,12,1%,72289,Cartman,"I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers. [Stan and Kyle are falling asleep. Kyle rests his head on his left hand] And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just- "
15,12,1%,72291,Cartman,Got something to say Kyle?! [grips the sides of the podium] 
15,12,1%,72293,Cartman,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle! [stops himself] Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. [a bagpipe player begins a tune. Two men lower the casket into the ground] "
15,12,1%,72294,Cartman,"Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to- "
15,12,1%,72296,Cartman,Fly bu-what? 
15,12,1%,72299,Cartman,[thinks a moment] Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly... 
15,12,1%,72304,Cartman,"Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ. "
15,12,1%,72314,Cartman,Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me. 
15,12,1%,72317,Cartman,"I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder! "
15,12,1%,72319,Cartman,"What do you mean, Rumpertumskin? "
15,12,1%,72324,Cartman,"Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party. "
15,12,1%,72330,Cartman,"That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue. "
15,12,1%,72335,Cartman,"So then, we are all going to need some... more tea. "
15,12,1%,72347,Cartman,"What the hell?! [the flames set his curtains on fire. He sees them next to his bed and stands up on the bed] Mom? Mom, my room is... [turns around and sees Peter Panda and his dresser on fire] AAAH!! PETER PANDA!! "
15,12,1%,72350,Cartman,[runs up] Don't you touch him! Leave him alone! [swats the doll out of the fireman's hands] Peter Panda! 
15,12,1%,72352,Cartman,"Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay! "
15,12,1%,72355,Cartman,[on all limbs] Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo! 
15,12,1%,72375,Cartman,"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright. "
15,12,1%,72377,Cartman,"Tolkien, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong. "
15,12,1%,72385,Cartman,"What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants? "
15,12,1%,72387,Cartman,"Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home. "
15,12,1%,72389,Cartman,"Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me. [the alarm sounds. Cartman puts his chips aside and gathers his toys close] What is that? WHAT IS THAT?! "
15,12,1%,72391,Cartman,What?! Who?! 
15,12,1%,72393,Cartman,"I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! [Tolkien looks out his window, Cartman leaves the bedroom] "
15,12,1%,72395,Cartman,"Who's there?! [notices Tolkien coming out behind him] Lock that door behind you, Tolkien. [then shouts at whomever might be there] Black people live here! [some flood lights come on] "
15,12,1%,72397,Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle! "
15,12,1%,72399,Cartman,Oh sure! 
15,12,1%,72401,Cartman,"Stephen Tamill? The fifth grader? [looks around] Oh shit! [drops the bat and runs back inside] I told you to lock that door, Tolkien! [runs up to Tolkien's room and searches for his stuffed toys] No. [sees the other four boys come in] Nononono! [grabs Kenny by the throat and shakes him] Where are they Kenny??!! "
15,12,1%,72403,Cartman,"HAAAAGH! [runs out and closes the door, then locks it and runs off] "
15,12,1%,72405,Cartman,[returns] I don't trust any of you assholes! [to his dolls] Where are you sons of bitches?! [leaves] 
15,12,1%,72424,Cartman,"Hello?? [lightning crackles outside and floods the kitchen in light for a moment] Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! [sees a boiling crock pot, walks up to it and removes the lid. Inside he see the third...] "
15,12,1%,72425,Cartman,Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! [more lightning crackles as he runs out of the kitchen.] 
15,12,1%,72427,Cartman,Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin! [walks towards the fireplace] Jesus Christ! [over the fireplace he sees Rumpertumskin drawn up by four chains and a bomb wrapped around his neck] 
15,12,1%,72429,Cartman,Who did this to you?! 
15,12,1%,72431,Cartman,"Don't worry, I'll get you down! "
15,12,1%,72433,Cartman,AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER [begins to cry] Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this?? 
15,12,1%,72435,Cartman,Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this? 
15,12,1%,72437,Cartman,"...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! [Tolkien, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny look down from the second floor] "
15,12,1%,72439,Cartman,They were your FRIENDS! 
15,12,1%,72444,Cartman,"Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble! "
15,12,1%,72446,Cartman,"There's one problem. [walks up to the doll, takes the gun and walks back to where he was] You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Tolkien for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything. "
15,12,1%,72448,Cartman,"[""Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal I won't lose you too! ""]"
15,12,1%,72450,Cartman,"[sobs for almost a minute, then aims the gun] Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72464,Cartman,Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? [Sawitsky crosses his arms and is not all all pleased] 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72468,Cartman,This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72470,Cartman,"Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72472,Cartman,"Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72474,Cartman,"You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72476,Cartman,"[like a doorbell] Dumbass, it's November. [normally] The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72481,Cartman,"Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72485,Cartman,Uh-huh?? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72492,Cartman,"Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72494,Cartman,"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? [he and Kenny raise their hands, then Stan raises his] "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72496,Cartman,"Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? [raises Kyle's hand] "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72503,Cartman,Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72505,Cartman,"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72507,Cartman,"See what I mean, you guys? [a black car with tinted windows pulls up at a corner within sight of the boys and the passenger window comes down and the agents inside look at the boys] "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72565,Cartman,"Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72567,Cartman,Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72569,Cartman,Oh no. Oh NO! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72571,Cartman,"Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! [turns around and leaves the kitchen] "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72573,Cartman,You guys have stuffing?! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72575,Cartman,"Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come! [Liane takes a shopping cart and follows Cartman to the right aisle. Cartman looks for the stuffing, but doesn't fine any. The attendant walks by] Hey! Where is it! "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72582,Cartman,No! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72584,Cartman,NOOOO! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72708,Cartman,"Yeah, History Channel rules. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72712,Cartman,[curious] Ohhh?? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72742,Cartman,"[filming with his phone] Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence. [chuckles and waves with his left hand] Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave! [to his phone] That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72757,Cartman,"[runs up to the other two with a memo pad] Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72759,Cartman,"Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72761,Cartman,"Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo- [noticing Craig coming into view] sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [as Craig passes by] Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? [stifles a laugh] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72763,Cartman,"Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. [stifles a laugh] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72772,Cartman,"This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72774,Cartman,Eh yeah? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72776,Cartman,"[laughs] Heh heh, yeah? "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72778,Cartman,What? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72780,Cartman,"[hops off his chair and moves off a bit, then gets a panicked look] Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72782,Cartman,"[turns around and glares at Butters] Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew! [makes a fist, then crosses his arms] Well I won't give him the satisfaction! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72784,Cartman,"Alright, let's hear it for Kyle! [claps] He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! Yeah, that's super funny, guys! [Stan and Kyle turn from their lockers to look at him] Laugh it up, everyone! [ends up by Stan and Kyle] Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72786,Cartman,That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! [runs away] 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72789,Cartman,"[sighs] Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72791,Cartman,"Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household? "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72793,Cartman,"You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72795,Cartman,"Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72797,Cartman,"[trying to get this straight] We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You can't just sit on your ass and expect some money to appear! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72799,Cartman,"Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72801,Cartman,"IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! [runs off] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72803,Cartman,My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72820,Cartman,"[comes down the stairs in a Hawaiian shirt] What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then. [walks over to the suitcases and grabs the handles] Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away? [turns left and begins to walk out] It's gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72825,Cartman,"[sets the picture aside] Yeah, yeah. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72827,Cartman,That's right. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72829,Cartman,"Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72831,Cartman,"Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! [Mr. Adams doesn't look too happy] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72833,Cartman,A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?! 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72835,Cartman,How?! 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72837,Cartman,"Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72840,Cartman,"Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet? "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72842,Cartman,"Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72844,Cartman,"What?? [looks out the window. A sign on the side of the road says ""Welcome to Greeley, 'The Exact Opposite of Hawaii"" Please drive safely"" A crow stands on top of the sign] Greeley? "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72847,Cartman,"What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72850,Cartman,You're my new mom? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72852,Cartman,"Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes? "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72855,Cartman,"Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72857,Cartman,Oh heell naw! [yells into the hallway] Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! [Mrs. Weatherhead walks in] 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72860,Cartman,"Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72863,Cartman,"You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! [Kenny walks up to a group of his new friends] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72867,Cartman,"[moves past Kenny] Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72869,Cartman,Really? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72871,Cartman,"[jumps for joy] YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!  Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school! [runs up to Jacob] Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys!  His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized! Greeley Colorado's the place to be! It's a whole new beginning for you and me! Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule! I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!    "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72874,Cartman,"Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom is so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. [laughs even harder] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72877,Cartman,I wasn't making fun of anybody. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72879,Cartman,I was just teasing. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72881,Cartman,"My case worker? [looks over his shoulder and sees Mr. Adams walk in] Oh, not this guy! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72883,Cartman,Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes! 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72918,Cartman,"Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72951,Cartman,I'm not saying it. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72953,Cartman,I'm not saying it! 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72955,Cartman,"Okay, fine! [turns to the camera] I'm white trash and I'm in trouble! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72962,Cartman,"[walks up] There he is, there's my buddy. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72964,Cartman,"Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?  The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue. 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school! Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul! All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) That's right, the poor kid in school. Sing it with me, guys! He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not) I'm not-    [a giant reptilian bird's head smashes through the roof and second floor of the school and the kids clear out as the head looks around]  "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72968,Cartman,"[begins to cry and walk away while Kyle stares angrily at him] Aww, my mom is so poor she walks down the road with one shoooe. [backs up] And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone."" "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72978,Cartman,"[whistles] Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72981,Cartman,"[puts his arm on Clyde] Of course, man. It's cool. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72983,Cartman,"[imitating Clyde's mom] Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! [He laughs, Butters joins him.] "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73000,Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73003,Cartman,"His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."" "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73005,Cartman,I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73007,Cartman,Nuh-uh. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73037,Cartman,"Mom, get the door! [Liane walks in to answer the door] "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73045,Cartman,Who are these buttholes? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73047,Cartman,My potty? What are they going to do to it? [runs upstairs] 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73049,Cartman,"Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! [Liane follows him] "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73056,Cartman,"Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73058,Cartman,"Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73093,Cartman,This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line! 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73101,Cartman,"Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now! "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73103,Cartman,What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73151,Cartman,"Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73153,Cartman,"Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73159,Cartman,"Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right? "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73164,Cartman,"Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73186,Cartman,That's right. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73188,Cartman,Yeah. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73190,Cartman,That's right. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73193,Cartman,"Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance? "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73207,Cartman,"Oh boy, here we go. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73219,Cartman,"So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73222,Cartman,"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde? "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73224,Cartman,"[his voice comes through the receiver] Clyde, you there? Hello? [Clyde comes off the toilet, flushing it. He waits for a few seconds, then angrily puts the seat up, and leaves the bathroom while flipping off his mother pointing upwards.] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73240,Cartman,"Nice bolo tie, Stan. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73242,Cartman,Bolo ties are... [quickly glances at Kyle] really in right now. Cool you have one. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73244,Cartman,"No, dude, it's... badass. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73248,Cartman,"...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73260,Cartman,"You may suck our collective balls, sir! [they leave the store, turn right and walk] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73288,Cartman,I told you guys. I've been watching all day. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73290,Cartman,This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. [walks out] 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73292,Cartman,"[standing next to a covered mobile whiteboard] For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. [unveils the equation] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73294,Cartman,"That's right. [goes through and denotes what each letter means] Guys with Cash For Gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals... Gold. [writes in an equal sign and ""GOLD"" at the end] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73297,Cartman,"Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73313,Cartman,"Hey Craig. Goin' on? Tolkien! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a- "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73315,Cartman,"[quickly analyzing the situation] Butters, what the fuck?! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73317,Cartman,"""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! [Butters picks the sign up and resumes twirling] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73319,Cartman,"Oh ahhhh, three bucks. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73321,Cartman,We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73342,Cartman,"Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5 [actually 55-26177] This is-oh my God, look at this you guys. [shows off the ring Leroy sold him earlier] This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the ring just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73344,Cartman,"YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73346,Cartman,"Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73348,Cartman,"Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73350,Cartman,"Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"" "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73352,Cartman,"Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73354,Cartman,Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73374,Cartman,"Suck my balls, suck my balls... [enters the store] Hello! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73376,Cartman,"[shoves his briefcase to one side] Yeah, listen, I'm running a resale business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73378,Cartman,"I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73380,Cartman,"Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73382,Cartman,"And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73384,Cartman,How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73386,Cartman,[long pause] What d'ja say? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73388,Cartman,Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73390,Cartman,"Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73392,Cartman,"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73394,Cartman,"My balls, my balls, suck 'em dry...[Butters opens his door and hops out, then opens Cartman's door. Cartman looks around and clears his throat to get Butters' attention.] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73397,Cartman,"[to the receptionist] You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that- [a disturbing sight stops him in his tracks] Motherfucker! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73399,Cartman,"[approaches the other boys] You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73401,Cartman, -and then tried to fuck me out of your business! 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73403,Cartman,"No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies! "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73442,Cartman,"[in a wooden dark place with two wires on the ground] I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73454,Cartman,"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. [The agents run after them.] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73459,Cartman,"Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73502,Cartman,"[yawns] Oh, God. That was boring. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73505,Cartman,"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73508,Cartman,"Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73513,Cartman,"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73515,Cartman,"Really? [the boys excitedly run, except for Butters] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73518,Cartman,Yes! 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73521,Cartman,"What's it say, what's it say? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73523,Cartman,"What? Let me see that. [the newspaper has Cartman's pictured and a headline 'Faith Hilling so 2,000 late'] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73528,Cartman,Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that? 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73531,Cartman,You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. [shows three other guys' pictures] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73533,Cartman,"I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage. [shows a couple of more pictures] This has to be stopped, you guys. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73536,Cartman,"How is this Kyle? This good? [the boy moves away a bit. The other kids are stunned. The boys stand next to them, Kyle having an iPhone in his hands] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73538,Cartman,"[continues moving as the other boy tries to get past him] Cool, these will be good uploads. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73540,Cartman,Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here? 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73544,Cartman,"Why don't you make me? [the boy punches him, Cartman responds by hitting him on the ground. Stan and Kyle begin to punch Boy 1 while Kenny attacks the girls.] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73571,Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this? [Mr. Kitty looks at him] You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty. [closes his laptop and approaches Mr. Kitty] Bad Mr. Kitty. [Cartman hits Mr. Kitty with a stick. Mr. Kitty hisses, then paws at him.] Bad kitty! No more memeing! [walks away] Come on, guys. [the boys walk out of the room. Cartman turns his back to scold his cat again] Bad Mr. Kitty! "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73575,Cartman,I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73585,Cartman,"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73601,Cartman,"Dude, what's going on? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73606,Cartman,"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73614,Cartman,"[holds him] Come on, Kyle. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73616,Cartman,"It's okay, man, come on. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73632,Cartman,"Get a couple facing the other way, brah. [turns the other way] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73637,Cartman,"I know. I know Kyle. [stops lifting his ""nipples"" up] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73639,Cartman,I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change. [starts crying] The sun hurts my eyes. [wipes away his tears] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73641,Cartman,"No, no. It was kind of stupid, really. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73643,Cartman,And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. [both of them sigh] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73665,Cartman,"[he is doing a combination of Taylor Swifting and Cat Breading] Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73669,Cartman,"No, kitty, you have to be quiet. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73671,Cartman,No kitty! That's a bad kitty! [Boy 1 and his friends come over] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73675,Cartman,[begins to crawl while holding Mr. Kitty] Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous! 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73679,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73681,Cartman,"SHUT UP, KITTY! "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73704,Cartman,"Let's do this. [he runs to the hallway, where Kenny hands him Mr. Kitty. He goes to the stage with Mr. Kitty, and pulls down his pants as Stan is ready to record him. He then stops, thinking.] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73707,Cartman,"[softly] No. NOO! [puts his pants back on] I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this. [puts down Mr. Kitty] And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. [he turns sideways and snaps his fingers a few times, then pulls up his shirt, Faith Hilling.] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73709,Cartman," [music begins to play] Alright, football night, what do you do? Get out your camera and a boobie or two.   "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73711,Cartman, We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.   
16,3,Faith Hilling,73713,Cartman," Come on everybody, It's Faith Hilling time. [the audience and Rick, Mitt and Newt join him] Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you? This is the only memeing I'll ever do.   "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73715,Cartman," Is a meme I will fight [Stan is joined by Kyle and Kenny in the audience. Butters is in the wooden classroom dancing to the song, yet still has the gun in his mouth] 'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.   "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73719,Cartman,"Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73721,Cartman,"Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? [Kyle stops and starts listening] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73723,Cartman,"So interesting, wow. [he and Sheila are drinking tea] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73725,Cartman,"Oh, hey, Kyle. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73727,Cartman,"Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73730,Cartman,Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73732,Cartman,"Alright, Kyle, listen. [comes forward with Kyle, then sighs] Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73734,Cartman,"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever. [Cartman announces the special within the episode] ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! [creepy music plays] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73740,Cartman,"[anxious] Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73742,Cartman,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73744,Cartman,"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73746,Cartman,"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls... "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73748,Cartman,"[angrily points at him] Yeah-uh, Tolkien! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73750,Cartman,"[keeps the boys away] Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73752,Cartman,"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73754,Cartman,I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73756,Cartman,"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73760,Cartman,[standing on his bed with camera kit attached to him] Butters. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73762,Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73764,Cartman,"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro! [Butters stammers a bit] I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73766,Cartman,"Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73768,Cartman,Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73770,Cartman,"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ. [a rustle comes through the bush] Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING! [to Butters] He's here somewhere. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73772,Cartman,JESUS IS A LIE! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73774,Cartman,"Shh! Help me call it out, Butters. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73776,Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?! [Butters thinks] THERE IS NO CHRIST! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73778,Cartman,"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73780,Cartman,Sh! You hear that? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73784,Cartman,"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video. [connects his video camera to the TV] What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra. [moves away a bit] And you're the first to see it. [the video shot of Butters and Cartman from last night is played on the TV] This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this. [pauses] 'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for... [an abrupt rustle] right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again. [plays that moment again] Wait for it... wait... there! [pauses to show the motion blurred animal that moves between bushes] Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73786,Cartman,"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73788,Cartman,"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. [the president walks to the window. Employee 1 follows him] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73795,Cartman,"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. [points on the map] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73797,Cartman,That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73799,Cartman,"Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! [drops in a pool, then comes out] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73802,Cartman,"Now we head back to Colorado, here. [points on the map] We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73805,Cartman,"People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73807,Cartman,"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73816,Cartman,I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73818,Cartman,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73821,Cartman,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73825,Cartman,Heh. What do you mean? [he is stunned] 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73827,Cartman,"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73831,Cartman,"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73833,Cartman,Why? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73837,Cartman,"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real. [loud thunder] Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah. [quickly makes a call with his cellphone] Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real? [Kyle is listening to him in his bed with his eyes half-closed] I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73839,Cartman,"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? [Kyle hangs up and goes back to sleep. His phone rings again, causing him so throw it to the wall.] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73841,Cartman, Jesus loves me this I know 'Cause Republicans tell me so Little ones God will protect 'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect [speaks on his radio]   Everything still clear out there? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73843,Cartman,[voice only] Guys?! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73845,Cartman,"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73847,Cartman,[in the church] What? What was that? Butters? Tolkien?! [the door is forced] Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh! [quickly hides between the candle stands] You guys?! GUYS! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73849,Cartman,It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73851,Cartman,Wingstreet?! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73853,Cartman,"Dude, I want wings! [there is some knocking on another door] Ahghgh!!! [it turns out to be Mr. Billings and his two employees.] Oh Jesus, it's only you! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73855,Cartman,HUH?! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73858,Cartman,Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73860,Cartman,"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME! [Employee 3 brushes his face with the blood of a chicken which is in the bucket he holds] What the-? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73862,Cartman,This isn't safe or fun! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73864,Cartman,"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73868,Cartman,"[smiles] Kyle! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks at him with his eyes half-closed] I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73870,Cartman,"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble! [Kyle frowns and walks away] No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money! [softly] Oh God, what am I doing? [shouts] I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke! [softly] Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73872,Cartman,It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome. [he is peeked by a pair of red slanted eyes with a snoring effect.] I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! [the pair of eyes turn out to be binoculars used by Bobo.] 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73877,Cartman,"Bobo?! Bobo, no! [Bobo fires a dart] Wha- [falls over] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73885,Cartman,[seems to be having a dream] Ugh... what... where... 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73887,Cartman,Ugh... what? [stands up] What's going on? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73890,Cartman,"It's raining frogggggsss! [finds Kyle, who is clinbing to the roof of his house on a ladder] Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73892,Cartman,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73894,Cartman,"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73896,Cartman,What does that mean? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73898,Cartman,"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73900,Cartman,"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! [Kyle gets angry] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73902,Cartman,"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73904,Cartman,"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73906,Cartman,"Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. [a bloody frog lands over the edge] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73908,Cartman,"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73910,Cartman,"I love you, dad. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73912,Cartman, And our love grows   
16,4,Jewpacabra,73914,Cartman," Have no fear, for God is near And God loves all his children   [he pats a lamb, but it is taken away by Gerald] Huh? [Sheila slices the lamb's head] Nooooooo! [Sheila and Gerald apply the lamb's blood to their door. Kyle watches them] Kyle, why? What are you doing?   "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73916,Cartman,"No, Kyle! I don't believe you! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73918,Cartman,"Noooo! [goes inside somewhere, but sees two kids with bloody eyes] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73920,Cartman,Noooooo! [runs past a mom and her child] 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73922,Cartman,Noooo! [he is confronted by a man] 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73924,Cartman,No! The bread's all flat! No! [shoves the bread down and keeps running] Aaaaahhhh! [the Pharaoh has kneeled down. All children around him have their heads explode. Screaming and shouting can be heard in the background] 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73926,Cartman,"We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! [his head explodes, and the Pharaoh crys in despair] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73928,Cartman,[sleeptalking] No! No! The bread is all flat! No! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73932,Cartman,"[offscreen] I'm alive! [everyone stops. Cartman runs in, gasping for air.] I'm alive, you guys. [holds Emily though her shoulders] I don't know how, but I'm alive! [lets go and keeps running] Can you believe it? It's a miracle. [runs to the stage] Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah, I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learned a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73934,Cartman,"Hey guys, listen! [Nobody cares. He finds Kyle standing there, approaches him, and lets out a deep sigh.] I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Knowing your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73936,Cartman,I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73938,Cartman,"Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle, happy Passover. "
16,5,Butterballs,73941,Cartman,"Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay? [the boys ignore him and continue eating] See? You can't remember. "
16,5,Butterballs,73953,Cartman,He has a point. 
16,5,Butterballs,73958,Cartman,I have balls. 
16,5,Butterballs,73960,Cartman,Still balls. 
16,5,Butterballs,74036,Cartman," [tarted up, takes over and backs up the stairs] Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play! You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.   "
16,5,Butterballs,74038,Cartman," [takes over at the corner and backs up, pointing at his own crotch] My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o [Some doors open and a naked Butters is showcased in a steel-framed clear box, being carried out by two sixth graders. The lights go out and special effects appear - neon paint on the kids' faces and a blue glow through the doors. Butters takes over.]   "
16,5,Butterballs,74109,Cartman,"'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. [nearby, Craig and Clyde take notice] "
16,5,Butterballs,74111,Cartman,"We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! [blows a raspberry at him] "
16,5,Butterballs,74157,Cartman,The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74177,Cartman,Somebody help us! [motion blur back to opening shots] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74180,Cartman,"Kyle, hurry! [a shot of Stan with Kyle] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74183,Cartman,"[inside a van, in a window seat] Oh God! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74192,Cartman,"Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74194,Cartman,"Look at his lip. [to Kenny] You've got herpes, dude. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74196,Cartman,"No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74199,Cartman,"Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74203,Cartman,Ziplining. Hell yeah. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74205,Cartman,"[being interviewed] We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74206,Cartman,"Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him. [leans over to see how close his finger can reach without touching] Zi- [Kenny puts his right mitten over his mouth and Cartman pulls his left hand back playfully] Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74208,Cartman,"Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister. [laughs] You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74216,Cartman,Alright! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74230,Cartman,"[being interviewed] Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. [the benches are rearranged so the zipliners can watch a TV screen above them] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74236,Cartman,...No. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74241,Cartman,Finally! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74250,Cartman,"Well, come on, we don't have a choice. [leads the others to the shuttle van.] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74260,Cartman,"Mmmm, no? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74264,Cartman,The trees' biology? 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74271,Cartman,"Yeah. [Michael shortens the strap between Cartman and the zipline, and holds him up] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74273,Cartman,Yeah. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74275,Cartman,Zipliiine. [Michael sends him on his way] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74279,Cartman,"Totally fuckin' stupid, dude! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74281,Cartman,"Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74288,Cartman,"[being interviewed] ""The next zipline? What are you talking about?"" "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74293,Cartman,NOOOO! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74301,Cartman,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [opening shots return] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74312,Cartman,[on his way down a zipline.] I'm so fucking bored! [Hour 3 arrives. Michael sends the next zipliner on down. The others cheer her on] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74320,Cartman,"We should have never listened to you, Kyle. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74322,Cartman,"Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"" "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74324,Cartman,I brought it up because you already brought it up! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74327,Cartman,Fuck you Kyle! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74333,Cartman,Nnnn-mo... 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74341,Cartman,"Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! [keeps sipping the Double Dew] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74343,Cartman,"This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew. [at the bottom of the can is a blurb saying ""DEW THE MATH!""] Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74345,Cartman,"If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74363,Cartman,NOOO! [opening shots return] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74366,Cartman,[still aching] Eeeeugh. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74372,Cartman,Uh oh. [lets out a wet fart] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74384,Cartman,A marina? 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74391,Cartman,"Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74394,Cartman,"Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74404,Cartman,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74408,Cartman,I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74415,Cartman,"No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74419,Cartman,You?! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74425,Cartman,[points at Stan] You... You killed Kenny! [Stan begins to weep] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74430,Cartman,[being interviewed] It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74431,Cartman,You came for us! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74435,Cartman,[being interviewed] We were saved. It was over. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74437,Cartman,"[being interviewed] No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74439,Cartman,"[being interviewed] It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. [takes a long sip] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74444,Cartman,What? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74451,Cartman,"[taking control of the situation] Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74454,Cartman,"Oh my God. Tolkien, aren't you stoked? [Tolkien looks over at him. The girls start practicing] Aww, that's awesome, Tolkien. I'm happy for you. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74456,Cartman,"Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74458,Cartman,"[confused] What the? ...Oh, Tolkien's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74461,Cartman,"[fairly whispering throughout, beginning when Mr. Garrison mentions Lord Stark. He sits between Tolkien and the new girl and grins as he looks at each of them by turn] Dude... Tolkien! [jerks his head a bit in the girl's direction and points at her] Tolkien. Dude. [Tolkien looks at him, then goes back to taking notes. Cartman smiles] Psst. Tolkien. [points to the girl again, but puts his right hand up so she doesn't notice. Tolkien is annoyed] Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Tolkien! Yeah, get in there. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74463,Cartman,...Tolkien. You want me to pass her a jelly bean? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74465,Cartman,Huh? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74468,Cartman,"Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis. [begins to laugh at his own joke] Right guys? [tries to hold the laugh in] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74470,Cartman,"[quickly looks at the girl and at Tolkien] Tolkien. [leans back in his seat so Tolkien has a clear view of the girl] Dude, dude. Dude. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74473,Cartman,"[approaching] Hey, guys? Can I talk to you? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74475,Cartman,"[motions to his left] Just, can I talk to you, real quick? [walks the girls over to the end of the hallway] What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Tolkien? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74477,Cartman,"Well, Tolkien's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74479,Cartman,"Yeah, of course. [the girls look at each other] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74481,Cartman,"Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74483,Cartman,"Thanks, you guys. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74497,Cartman,WHAT?! KYLE?! [the girls don't hear him] 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74501,Cartman,Motherfucker! [gets up and runs off] 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74504,Cartman,"Hey, ah, Nichole, right? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74506,Cartman,"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here? [takes her to another set of bleachers nearby] Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74508,Cartman,"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know. [fakes a sweat] Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74510,Cartman,"Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74512,Cartman,"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74514,Cartman,"Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. [snaps his fingers and walks away] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74519,Cartman,"Psst Butters. Butters! [Butters stops and notices, then walks over to Cartman] At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74521,Cartman,"[takes off his shades] Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Tolkien and Nichole are gonna be practically married. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74523,Cartman,"No no. [walks him towards the camera] Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74528,Cartman,"Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! [the boys make a break for the front of the school and exit the front doors] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74564,Cartman,"[hiding in the bushes, weeping silently] Oh my God, sooo cute. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74567,Cartman,[sweetly] Ohhhhh my God. 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74569,Cartman,"You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. [tickles the little cupid] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74572,Cartman," I see the questions in your eyes I know what's weighing on your mind You can be sure I know, my heart Girl I'll stand beside you through the years You'll only cry those happy tears And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky I'll be there I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl) I'll be there For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part) I'll love you with every black beat of my heart And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?   "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74574,Cartman,"Did you see that? Tolkien was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. [behind him, on the merry-go-round, are Stan, Kenny, and Butters. Stan and Kenny are playing with a ball.] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74576,Cartman,"I don't know, it's just so... perfect. [Stan and Kenny resume playing] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74578,Cartman,"Kyle, Jesus Christ! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74580,Cartman,"Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74582,Cartman,"Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Tolkien and Nichole! They belong together! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74584,Cartman,"Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez? [points to a Hispanic couple riding play elephants] Is it a coincidence they ended up together?! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74586,Cartman,Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that. 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74588,Cartman,"Shh, quiet, Cupid Me. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74590,Cartman,Nothing. 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74592,Cartman,Nobody. 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74594,Cartman,"Why, Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Tolkien and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are! [can't fault him there. Nichole giggles again. Kyle looks defeated] Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74608,Cartman,"Come on! [pounds on the door some more] Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry it up in there?! [pounds on the door some more. The door opens and Cupid Me floats out] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74610,Cartman,"Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74612,Cartman,"That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me! [covers his nose with his bath robe] Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74614,Cartman,"Dude, at least flush the toilet! [walks over to it] Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74616,Cartman,"You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! [tries to catch Cupid Me, but Cupid Me keeps away] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74618,Cartman,I'm gonna get you! [chases Cupid Me out of the bathroom] 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74620,Cartman,"I almost got you! Almost! [Liane walks out of her room with clean laundry, and there's no sign of Cupid Me] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74622,Cartman,"Everything's great, Mom. [to the invisible Cupid Me] No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! [dances away] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74640,Cartman,[crying inconsolably and blowing his nose into a tissue] It's not fair! They were so... happy! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74642,Cartman,It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74644,Cartman,"No, they won't! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74646,Cartman,"No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74648,Cartman,And you! I should have never believed in you! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74650,Cartman,"[grabs the imaginary cupid] I never wanna see you again! [hurls it into his closet door. It flies low. Cartman gets out of bed, grabs a bat that's conveniently leaning against his bedroom door, and bashes the cupid over and over] Take! Your sunshine! And fuckin'! Die! [puts the bat up against the door and crawls back into bed. Butters takes Cartman's hand again and Cartman resumes crying] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74667,Cartman,"That's right... That's right! [runs up to his room, goes into his closet and digs through his stuff until he finds the shoe box he put Cupid Me into after whacking him almost to death. He takes off the lid] Ohhh. [Cupid Me is shown laying face down battered and bruised, with a dry blood stream still near his mouth] I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74669,Cartman,"Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74671,Cartman,"Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. [tickles the cupid] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74673,Cartman,"Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74676,Cartman,"Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74678,Cartman,Denver Nuggets game? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74680,Cartman,[dolly zoom] NOOOOOOO! [runs away quickly] 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74685,Cartman,Nooooooo! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74690,Cartman,[running into the center] NOOOOOOO! [triggers an alarm] 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74692,Cartman,No time! NOOOOOOO! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74694,Cartman,"Attention! Attention please! [Kyle and Nichole are surprised to hear his voice. Cartman is on the MegaTron] This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it! [Tolkien is surprised to see Cartman there too, but Craig and Clyde are unfazed] Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands! [Nichole begins to take this in] Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. [Kyle is getting pissed off] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74696,Cartman,"I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.  I swear by the moon and the stars and the sky [Cartman and Kyle are paired on the MegaTron and the lovecam is activated - a heart appears over their images, Cartman on the left, Kyle on the right] I'll be there, Kyle I swear [Crowd: ""Awwww."" Kyle tries to push it all away] like the shadow that's by your side Kyle, swear to God I'll be there. For better or worse [Brad appears: ""better or worse""], till death do us part [Brad: ""death do us part""] I'll love you with [Cartman and Brad] every gay beat of my heart!   "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74698,Cartman,"I swear, Kyle. [the crowd erupts in applause, as do the players. Kyle leaves his seat, steaming mad] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74702,Cartman,"Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside. [now with urgency] Seriously you guys, you gotta see it. It's the Bat-Mobile! It's outside. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74715,Cartman,"Oh my gohhhd, so cute! [runs out of the control room. Cupid Me appears] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74717,Cartman,"That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74719,Cartman,Really?! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74721,Cartman,"What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74723,Cartman,"Hey, stop it! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74725,Cartman,Nooo! 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74744,Cartman,"That's right, Butters. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74785,Cartman,"Yeah, you know what? [removes his bra and throws it to the floor] Screw this! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74789,Cartman,That's true. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74796,Cartman,"[puts his bra back on] Let's do this. [turns his back towards Stan] Stan, hook up my bra. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74824,Cartman,Who needs a coach? We have Butters. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74829,Cartman,"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74873,Cartman,"Hey Butters, you got a minute? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74875,Cartman,"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74877,Cartman,"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74879,Cartman,...I don't have a dad. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74881,Cartman,You save it all? 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74884,Cartman,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74886,Cartman,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74888,Cartman,[analyzes some more...] Holy shit I think I do. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74909,Cartman,That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74952,Cartman,That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness. 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74968,Cartman,"[looks over his left shoulder] Dude, how come when we play baseball I always have to be the catcher? [looks at the gloves again] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74970,Cartman,"[turns left to address Kyle] I'm not fat, Kyle. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74972,Cartman,"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like that bitch! [they see a scooter rolls past them with an obese man on it] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74976,Cartman,See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal. 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74980,Cartman,"[eyes some Oreos and goes for them] Oh my God you guys, look at this! [grabs a box and reads it] Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling. [closes his eyes and looks up joyfully] Holy hell yes! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74983,Cartman,"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. [walks over, tosses them into her basket, and walks away with his head down] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74985,Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74987,Cartman,"[walks in] I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart. [stops] You're right Kyle. I'm fat. [sighs] All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74989,Cartman,"[turns around] No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it. [walks out of the house. Kyle is puzzled. Moments later, Cartman returns on a Rascal and rolls on into Kyle's living room] Sweeeeeeeeeet! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74991,Cartman,"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket on the front for my candy corn Oreos. [begins to ride in a circle around Kyle] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74993,Cartman,"[stops] Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. [rides away] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74995,Cartman,"[reaches the restroom and tries to get it, but the base is too wide] Hmm. [tries again. Kyle catches up] I can't. [tries again] I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. [tries again] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74997,Cartman,"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle. [tries again] You've gotta make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. [tries again] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74999,Cartman,"That's not the way this country works, Kyle. [tries again] Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter. [tries again] It's the law. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75001,Cartman,"[tries again] Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible. [tries again] I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit. [backs out and prepares to leave] Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. [rolls away. Kyle looks on angrily] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75003,Cartman,"[""Nobody understands how embarrassing it is to live with obesity."" He rides past a couple] Out of the way. Out of the way please. [""Wherever you go, you're treated differently"" He arrives at a Denny's] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75007,Cartman,"Coming through. Oh how humiliating. [now at the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland: ""But even at Disneyland I get reminded of my weight."" He rolls into the short line] Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel. [reaches the front of the line] Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have- [finds a line of other scooter riders in front of him] Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75009,Cartman,"Yeah, well you got skinny arms! [Later on, Cartman rolls through Cinderella's Castle. ""And then even Disneyland can't take away the shame, as all the people suffering from obesity are ignored. Like, we're invisible."" A woman's baby carriage gets in the way and she quickly pulls it back as Cartman rolls towards the exits] 'Scuse me. Move it. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75011,Cartman,"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy? [chokes up and begins to sob] At Best Buy I'm sorry. [At the defense table sits a Best Buy employee, looking around] To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom? [reaches for a long-handled grip with his left hand, then uses it to take a tissue from the judge's bench. He grabs the tissue with his right hand and lowers the grip, then blows his nose] Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75017,Cartman,"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. [facing him is the rest of the fourth grade class] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75019,Cartman,"What, Kyle?! [the device then collapses and puts itself away] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75021,Cartman,"[rolls up to him] You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75023,Cartman,"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?! [rolls back to the workers] This is exactly what Adele is talking about! [begins to pace back and forth] Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle! [rolls up to Kyle] Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day [rolls away] to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers! [rolls back up to Kyle] You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! Eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look! [rolls to the far end of the gum] I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75048,Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. [gets off the Rascal] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75121,Cartman,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Tolkien, and you should be ashamed of yourself! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75123,Cartman,"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Tolkien, I would like you to meet my lawyer! [the lawyer appears outside the office and tries to enter, but can't. The lawyer is on his own Rascal] As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75127,Cartman,What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75129,Cartman,"[begins riding around] I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! [turns around and rides out of the office] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75133,Cartman,"[making 8's with his Rascal and itching for a fight] You're goin' down, bitch! [also in attendance are Butters, Stan, Kevin, and Craig] Nobody takes my ratings! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75135,Cartman,I'm pissed! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75137,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75142,Cartman,"I ain't done with you, bitch! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75160,Cartman,"[amid some ows and grunts] Oh! You fucking bitch! [Michelle Obama finally punches him off his Rascal. She picks it up over her head, then smashes it into the ground, breaking it. She then kicks Cartman in the stomach for good measure.] "
16,10,Insecurity,75199,Cartman,"Dude, no way! "
16,10,Insecurity,75206,Cartman,"[Walks up to him] Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual? "
16,10,Insecurity,75208,Cartman,"Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom? "
16,10,Insecurity,75210,Cartman,"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security! "
16,10,Insecurity,75220,Cartman,"Oh no, really? "
16,10,Insecurity,75222,Cartman,"Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom! "
16,10,Insecurity,75225,Cartman,What-what do you mean? 
16,10,Insecurity,75227,Cartman,"Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew! "
16,10,Insecurity,75229,Cartman,Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both! 
16,10,Insecurity,75252,Cartman,Oh fuck. [Goes to the touchpad by the door to shut it off] Oh what's the- God damn it! [The phone rings and he goes to answer it. He puts his left index finger in his left ear to hear from the right ear better] Hello? 
16,10,Insecurity,75255,Cartman,"Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm! "
16,10,Insecurity,75257,Cartman,"Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew. [Thinks a moment] No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew. "
16,10,Insecurity,75259,Cartman,"Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere. "
16,10,Insecurity,75261,Cartman,Sorry about this. 
16,10,Insecurity,75263,Cartman,"'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?! "
16,10,Insecurity,75265,Cartman,"[Liane appears at the top of the stairs and becomes coming down, but stops to hear what Eric is saying] That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now! "
16,10,Insecurity,75267,Cartman,"[His mom goes back up the stairs] I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit! "
16,10,Insecurity,75276,Cartman,"You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it? [closes and locks the door, then arms the system, then goes to the phone to wait for Wolf Home Security to call. The cat burglar pounds a window until it gives way and he goes in. The alarm goes off a second later. Cartman gets pissed off when the burglar breaks a second window and there's no response from Wolf. Finally the call comes in, and Cartman answers it] Hello? "
16,10,Insecurity,75278,Cartman,"[The cat burglar appears as he goes towards the stairs. He then stops] Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom. [Softly, to the cat burglar while muffling the mic] Go go, she's upstairs. [The cat burglar heads up the stairs] Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white! "
16,10,Insecurity,75280,Cartman,Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped! 
16,10,Insecurity,75282,Cartman,"He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry! "
16,10,Insecurity,75284,Cartman,"Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out! [Looks at the phone] The fuck?! "
16,10,Insecurity,75306,Cartman,[stops] Who is there? 
16,10,Insecurity,75308,Cartman,"Oh?! Ohhh?! [backs away quickly. The phone rings, but Cartman goes to the kitchen to answer it] Yes? Yeah, hello? "
16,10,Insecurity,75310,Cartman,A man just broke into my house and is- [looks at the phone] Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?! 
16,10,Insecurity,75312,Cartman,"Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on! "
16,10,Insecurity,75314,Cartman,Heh- hello? 
16,10,Insecurity,75316,Cartman,"No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?! "
16,10,Insecurity,75318,Cartman,"Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me! "
16,10,Insecurity,75320,Cartman,"Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?! "
16,10,Insecurity,75322,Cartman,Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! [slams the phone on the floor] 
16,10,Insecurity,75356,Cartman,[runs up to them] HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! [wears a little sign on his head showing that ] 
16,10,Insecurity,75358,Cartman,"Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere. "
16,10,Insecurity,75360,Cartman,"Oh, fat bitch, huh?! [gets smug] Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT! "
16,10,Insecurity,75362,Cartman,"What? [his alarm goes off, then he gets the call] Hello? "
16,10,Insecurity,75364,Cartman,"Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity. "
16,10,Insecurity,75366,Cartman,"Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs. "
16,10,Insecurity,75368,Cartman,"No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs. "
16,10,Insecurity,75370,Cartman,My password is uloveboobs! 
16,10,Insecurity,75372,Cartman,"You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?! "
16,10,Insecurity,75374,Cartman,"Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-! [notices Kyle is gone, but looks around] Kyle? God damn it. "
16,10,Insecurity,75411,Cartman,"[in the perfume section of a store, with a saleswoman behind the counter] Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne. "
16,10,Insecurity,75419,Cartman,"[outside a store] God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards![Martin is swamped with calls. Another one comes in] Hello? [his own INsecurity has gone off] "
16,10,Insecurity,75438,Cartman,"[in Bane mask] It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. [the men return in Bane masks to haul the agent out and beat him up] "
16,11,Going Native,75441,Cartman,FELLAS! Fellas! 
16,11,Going Native,75443,Cartman,You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson! 
16,11,Going Native,75445,Cartman,"It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him! "
16,11,Going Native,75447,Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! [the other boys get concerned and leave their tables to go to the restroom] "
16,11,Going Native,75455,Cartman,"Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? [Kenny flashes an angry look] "
16,11,Going Native,75457,Cartman,...Wow. 
16,11,Going Native,75493,Cartman,"Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. [the other boys gather around him] "
16,11,Going Native,75495,Cartman,Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii. 
16,11,Going Native,75497,Cartman,"He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut. "
16,11,Going Native,75502,Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. [Kenny sighs and walks away with his head down.] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75719,Cartman,We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75721,Cartman,"Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75724,Cartman,"Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75726,Cartman,[walks off with Kenny] You'll just have to wait and see. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75751,Cartman,"[dressed as Hulk, comes in from the kitchen] Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75763,Cartman,"This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75766,Cartman,"Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" [they head for a house to their left. Kenny rings the bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75770,Cartman,[dropping his pose] I'm not Bruce Vilanch! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75772,Cartman,The Incredible... 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75775,Cartman,No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75778,Cartman,"The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75780,Cartman,[loses his cool and shuts his eyes] JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY! [moments later they're on to the next house] It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! [Kenny rings the door bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.] 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75783,Cartman,That's right! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75805,Cartman,"Dude dude dude! Check it out. [points to something across the street... a robbery in progress. One robber is outside a Kum & Go minimart. He breaks a surveillance camera with a crowbar, then jimmies the door open and goes in] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75808,Cartman,"[turns around] You guys, we've gotta stop it! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75814,Cartman,Cartman SMASH! [they turn around and go into action] 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75821,Cartman,"[roars some more, then] Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind. [walks to the counter and sees a dead clerk slumped over the counter] Holy shit, they shot this guy! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75865,Cartman,Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75874,Cartman,"Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75950,Cartman,[upset] I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75955,Cartman,"All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?! [begins to roll up his sleeve, but then] Oh, hold on. [takes off his jacket and lets it drop to the floor] Aah, let's see... that one. [the same yellow one the others are having cut off. She cuts that one off] Stupid fraud! [spits onto the band] Good riddance to YOU! [picks up his coat and puts it on, walks off, and another man replaces him. The pharmacists adds Cartman's wrist band onto the others] "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75959,Cartman,"Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75961,Cartman,"Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?! [Stan sighs and steps forward, turns right and walks away] What's wrong with him? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75973,Cartman,Uh huh. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75975,Cartman,"So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times. [reaches his locker and opens it, then notices Stan. Butters walks over to Craig and another boy.] Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75977,Cartman,"The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75980,Cartman,"Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76049,Cartman,Craig?! You asshole! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76140,Cartman,"[meets the first group] Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76142,Cartman,"Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76144,Cartman,"...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76169,Cartman,"[steps up] Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76177,Cartman,"...Fuck! Dude, weak. [the town is covered in scauses and looks like a Dr. Seuss town] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76194,Cartman,Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76196,Cartman,MOM! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76200,Cartman,She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76204,Cartman,Mom? Where's my mom? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76208,Cartman,"[wriggles in his seat and laughs] ""Warm nuts"", she said. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76210,Cartman,Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76213,Cartman,[breaks into a smile and laughs] No way dude. No way. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76215,Cartman,MOOOM! I can't find my mooom! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76218,Cartman,"Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. [both passenger and attendant frown at him] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76220,Cartman,MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76226,Cartman,[from the Cartman kitchen] Hey Kyle. What's up? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76228,Cartman,"Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society. [Kyle glances at Ike.] Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76230,Cartman,"Please, Kyle. It's kind of important. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76233,Cartman,"You happy with the election results last night, Kyle? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76235,Cartman,"Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? [beams] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76237,Cartman,"What if I did, Kyle? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76239,Cartman,"Pretty sweet, huh? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76241,Cartman,What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76243,Cartman,"No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76245,Cartman,"[walks up to a stack] Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle. [holds up a ballot] Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. [tears the ballot in two, lets the pieces fall, and fakes a shocked face] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76247,Cartman,[Walks over to another stack] Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. [tears up that ballot] 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76249,Cartman,"Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76251,Cartman,"Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76253,Cartman,"Thanks Mom, [she leaves] I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76269,Cartman,"[strokes his chin] Hmmm, no. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76271,Cartman,"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76274,Cartman,Ey! You can't do that! Ey! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76277,Cartman,I know my rights! Stop right now! [Kyle and the officers go in... and find nothing] 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76279,Cartman,"I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76283,Cartman,"But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. [Kyle turns right and runs down the stairs] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76312,Cartman,"Mm, mhm, mhm. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76314,Cartman,They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76316,Cartman,Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76356,Cartman,"Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76367,Cartman,"So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76369,Cartman,"Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. [takes out a small ball-shaped bomb, smashes it against the table, and disappears in the resulting smoke.] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76391,Cartman,"Butters. [Butters jumps up and is wide awake] You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76393,Cartman,"I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76395,Cartman,"Shhh, it's okay, Butters. [brings forth an M&M bag and opens it] Nobody's gonna find the election ballots. [pulls out a blue almond M&M.] I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look. [places the M&M in Butters' mouth and closes it] A place in town people barely even know exists. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76403,Cartman,"Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76405,Cartman,"Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76407,Cartman,"I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76409,Cartman,I want a part in the new movies! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76411,Cartman,I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76413,Cartman,"Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76415,Cartman,Haha. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76417,Cartman,Haha. [and a new partnership is formed.] 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76448,Cartman,"[on a tauntaun] I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! [police cars show up] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76451,Cartman,"Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76464,Cartman,"No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! [the Chinese, the police officers, and the boys all hold hands around the bonfire and begin to chant] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76468,Cartman,"[walks up to them, talking to someone on the phone via speaker] Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76470,Cartman,"Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"" "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76473,Cartman,"Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76475,Cartman,"[softly, covering the phone] Kyle, this is a private conversation. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76478,Cartman,"Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76480,Cartman,"Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76483,Cartman,Who is that? Is that Toby? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76485,Cartman,"Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76487,Cartman,"You're what? What, you say? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76490,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore! [he's not talking to his friends at the table, but to his friends on the conference call] Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76492,Cartman,"See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! [Kyle takes the top bun off his burger] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76494,Cartman,That'd be what? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76496,Cartman,"I know, right? [Kyle puts the bun back on the burger, then takes his tray with him and walks away] A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages! [having lost his appetite, Kyle throws his food away, puts his tray on the nearby cart, and walks off. Cartman approaches the trash can] I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now. [carelessly throws his trash away, with fries spilling onto the floor, puts his tray carelessly on the card, then walks off behind Kyle] I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know? [Kyle stops, his anger rising] Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site. [turns on the video feature on his phone and starts recording] What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret! [ends the video and goes back to his phone friends. Kyle leaves] You guys gonna update your blogs too? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76498,Cartman,"Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76500,Cartman,"Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76502,Cartman,"Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. [Kyle just walks up to Cartman and stands next to him] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76504,Cartman,"Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle! [runs off, then stops and addresses everyone on the playground] Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76506,Cartman,"That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? [walks away. The other kids disperse and go back to what they were doing. Only Butters and Kyle remain.] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76511,Cartman,"Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76513,Cartman,"Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?! [pounds the keyboard with his right fist. The other kids begin to star at him] This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76515,Cartman,"Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76517,Cartman,"No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna- [gets suspicious] Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence. [hides behind his monitor for a moment, then slowly stands up on his chair] I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room. [sits down] Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76519,Cartman,"What, they already have something better than Twitter? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76521,Cartman,No! What Alec Baldwin commercial? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76525,Cartman,"[""Alright, what's up everybody, what's up? I'm about ready to go to the NSA undercover, and see if I can expose some of those secrets."" When Cartman appears, Kyle stops. ""You can follow me on my Shitter account at #keepyourgovernmentoutofmybusinessdotcom. Wait, sh, I've gotta be careful. Kyle is here and I'm pretty sure he's tryin' to listen in.""] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76527,Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle. ""Kyle, if you wouldn't mind, this broadcast is for my Shitter followers only."" Clyde and Stan join them] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76529,Cartman,"[leans towards Clyde. ""Don't know if you've heard, but the government is actually able to monitor all our e-mails and Twitter accounts."" leans towards Clyde. ""With Shitter I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet, and then to everyone else on Shitter.""] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76531,Cartman,"[leans towards Stan. ""Yes. Now as I infiltrate the NSA, I'll be able to broadcast everything to all my Shitter followers.""] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76533,Cartman,"Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76535,Cartman,Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76537,Cartman,"[""Oh cute. I'll have to try it out sometime, lol.""] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76539,Cartman,"[""Wow, that's kewl. She's cute. ;) emoji""] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76550,Cartman,"Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76552,Cartman,Bill Clinton. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76554,Cartman,"Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76558,Cartman,"I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76560,Cartman,"[clears his throat as a distraction] I was um, sure that the appointment was today. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76581,Cartman,Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76597,Cartman,"[""Four sixteen pm. The chief asked me to join him as he went to question the possible suspects. I agreed to go along. Hopefully, the NSA has no idea of my secret intentions."" The chief looks at him. ""lol."" The chief focuses on the road again. Moments later they stop in front of a house and get out of the car. The chief knocks on the door and a hippie answers it.] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76624,Cartman,"[""I've done it. I've infiltrated the NSA, and gained their trust."" A shot of Alec Baldwin and his date at a buffet restaurant. The camera pans across until it reaches the couple. ""So far, I've not ascertained how they were able to keep track of everyone in the country, but I'm close. Very close. I just hope that I'm not found out as a whistleblower before I'm able to expose their entire operation.""] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76627,Cartman,"Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76630,Cartman,Really? How big is my file? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76632,Cartman,"Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76635,Cartman,"Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet."" [no one listens. He stands up on his desk] 'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76654,Cartman,"Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76656,Cartman,The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76658,Cartman,[runsn to catch up with the chief] Can't do anything?? You're the NSA! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76660,Cartman,I don't know. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76662,Cartman,"Get their hands on what? [the chief presses some keys on the keypad next to the doors, and the doors open] Dude... [Santa is shown suspended in midair by a harness. Cables go from Santa to the surrounding wall of computers, and a massive one is attached to his privates. Several techs stand on a platform circling the room, looking at some of the many computers present] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76664,Cartman,"You think I'm fat and unimportant now?! [rips off his fake mustache] I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76667,Cartman,"[""Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!""] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76669,Cartman,You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76672,Cartman,"[through his tears] It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76674,Cartman,Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! [cries hard now] 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76676,Cartman,"It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! [weeps some more] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76678,Cartman,I do toooo! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76680,Cartman,"Okaaay. [she walks out and Cartman calms down] I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76684,Cartman,"...The fuck are you talking about, Butters? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76686,Cartman,"[walks away, then stops] It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76688,Cartman,What's this? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76690,Cartman,I can be forgiven? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76692,Cartman,For everything bad I've ever done? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76694,Cartman,And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76696,Cartman,[wipes his forhead and sniffs] Thta's pretty kewl. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76699,Cartman,"I do, I love my country! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76701,Cartman,I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76710,Cartman,"Boooo! [Wendy looks up and gets angry] Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76712,Cartman,"Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76714,Cartman,"Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo! [Wendy lowers her report down to her sidee-] Boo Wendy! Liar! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76716,Cartman,"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76722,Cartman,That's more like it. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76736,Cartman,"Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen? "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76738,Cartman,You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76751,Cartman,Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76830,Cartman,"You guys? [Stan and Kyle turn to face him. He's at the end of the hall] You guys, you'd better get over here. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76832,Cartman,Butters' dad killed his mom. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in disbelief] 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76860,Cartman,"Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! [the kids clamor for a few seconds] "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76864,Cartman,"And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76866,Cartman,"Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76873,Cartman,"Alright, we've gotta do something. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76885,Cartman,"Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"" "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76887,Cartman,"You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76893,Cartman,Son of a bitch! [grabs Corey by the collar] Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76967,Cartman,"Hey Tolkien! [walks up to Tolkien] What's up, bro? "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76969,Cartman,"""Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks. [sniffs] Everything good with you? "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76971,Cartman,"Sweet. [Jimmy walks over and Cartman notices him] Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'? "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76973,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Tolkien. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President. [Jimmy walks away and Tolkien is done at his locker] About time. [Stan and Kyle stop to watch] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76976,Cartman,"Dude, um, what are doing after school, Tolkien? You wanna, you wanna hang out? [Tolkien puts one last book in before closing his locker] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76978,Cartman,"God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess. [makes a fist with his left hand and straightens out his arm toward Tolkien] Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. [Tolkien reluctantly makes a fist with his right hand and bumps Cartman's fist with it. He leaves, and Cartman moves on in a happy mood, stopping by Stan and Kyle] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76980,Cartman,"Yeah, I feel great. Why? [looks back] You think something's wrong? [moves on, not smiling] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76983,Cartman,"Mister! [Herbert Garrison turns around] No! Stop, Tolkien, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt! [wakes up violently and looks bewildered. Tolkien is stunned, and Herbert Garrison, with his arms crossed, is not pleased.] Hey Tolkien. What's up, bro? [makes a fist and extends it towards Cartman] Fist bump? [Tolkien is unmoved and upset] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76986,Cartman,It's Tolkien. I think he's a ticking time bomb. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76988,Cartman,He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76990,Cartman,"But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault! "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76992,Cartman,"No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76994,Cartman,M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76996,Cartman,M'kay. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76998,Cartman,"No, Tolkien! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Tolkien, Tolkien! "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77029,Cartman,Hey Tolkien? How are you doing? 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77031,Cartman,That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends. [puts his left fist forward] Fist bump. [leans to his left a little] Fist bump. [Tolkien closes his locker and hurries away] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77033,Cartman,"No! My wife, Tolkien! Tolkien, that's my wife! "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77035,Cartman,No Tolkien! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! [wakes up] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77038,Cartman,Agreed. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77040,Cartman,"Hoh boy, here we go. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77042,Cartman,"[after a few seconds] Tolkien, I wasn't on that jury. Okay? "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77044,Cartman,"This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77047,Cartman,"I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem? [pulls out his poem and begins] It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" [clears his throat]  I was not the bullet. I was not the gun. I was not the juror that set the shooter free. I was not the trigger. I was not the hate. Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me? I was not the black family mourning for the dead. ""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?"" I was not the verdict.   "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77049,Cartman,"It's going to rhyme, Tolkien, just hold on.  I was not the shooter. I was not the gun. So Tolkien, you should be cool while we're all here at school.  [folds his poem up and puts it away.] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77052,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77054,Cartman,It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77060,Cartman, Black people say He-ey! [Tolkien and Nicole stay quiet] Cool. White people say Ho ho! [Tolkien and Nicole begin to get mad]   
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77062,Cartman," Black people say Hey hey hey! [no reply] Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!""   "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77064,Cartman,"Tolkien, calm down. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77066,Cartman,Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! [throws his mic down and runs off] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77068,Cartman,"Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [runs inside his house] Mom it's starting! We've gotta go! [runs up to his room and opens a drawer. He rifles through it looking for something] Come on, come on! [finds a red safety box with ""BRAD PITT SURVIVAL GEAR"" printed on the lid and on the panel under the clasp. He opens it and pulls out a gun and a Brad Pitt costume. He puts the costume on, takes the gun, and runs out into the street] Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! [nearby, a couple is on their front lawn. The man is trimming bushes while his wife is shoveling snow by the front door.] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77073,Cartman,[frantically] Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77075,Cartman,Get to an airport! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77077,Cartman,"We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! [she presses the pedal and takes off] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77080,Cartman,The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [enters the tunnel] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77083,Cartman,"Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go! [Nelly's Mom rushes into the plane. Three black security guards appear] Oh my God! [closes the plane's door and locks it. The guards try to get in, but Cartman holds the handle down with all his might] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77085,Cartman,The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! [the plane takes off moments later] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77088,Cartman,The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77090,Cartman,You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! [the passengers all take their seats.] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77105,Cartman,Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. [points to the island on a map.] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77108,Cartman,Everyone quiet! I have to think! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77110,Cartman,"I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. [heads off to the restroom. He sees the ""vacant"" sign and opens the door, only to see a black man on the toilet] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77112,Cartman,"Nah! [shuts the door and jumps back, then throws everything he can at the door so the occupant can't exit] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77114,Cartman,[running back to his seat] One of them is in the back! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77130,Cartman,"Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time! "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77132,Cartman,It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77136,Cartman,His name is Tolkien. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77138,Cartman,I won't do it! He used to be my friend! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77140,Cartman,[sighs] Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77143,Cartman,We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77145,Cartman,[takes her hand] Come on! [they leave the crash site] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77153,Cartman,Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes! [walks up to the counter] I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77155,Cartman,A person. [Nelly's Mom looks around] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77157,Cartman,Threatening all of us! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77160,Cartman,What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77162,Cartman,Stand my ground? 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77165,Cartman,"Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that! "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77167,Cartman,"[walks away from the counter] This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Tolkien with all these stupid rules?! [his eyes light up] Wait a minute. I can't shoot Tolkien, [turns around] but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida? "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77170,Cartman,The other way to stop the outbreak. Tolkien isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77172,Cartman,"Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go![the plane takes off. Once in the air...] Find the closest airport in Florida! [injects himself with something] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77174,Cartman,"If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left! [everyone sits down] Black guy in the back! [the plane crashes into the Everglades. Cartman and Nelly's Mom make it out of the wreckage] Alight, now let's find Zimmerman. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77176,Cartman,"Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. [hands her a black sweater, which she puts on as she walks onto the roadway] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77178,Cartman,I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77180,Cartman,"Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77222,Cartman,Hey Tolkien. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77224,Cartman,"Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77226,Cartman,"Uh oh. [brings forth a can of red spray paint and paints a red circle around himself in the middle of the street] Sounds like you're still angry, Tolkien. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77228,Cartman,"Alright Tolkien, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea. [makes a fist with his right hand and puts it forth] First bump? [Tolkien stays put] Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. [Tolkien walks up to the red circle, then bends forward and offers his left fist. Then he steps into the circle and Cartman quickly shoots him] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77230,Cartman,"That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine. [drags Tolkien's body into the circle] Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. [smiles when no one answers.] "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77235,Cartman,Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77237,Cartman,Yeah. So bad. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77239,Cartman,"Jury found me innocent, Kyle! "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77241,Cartman,You interrupt people when they talk. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77243,Cartman,Oh man! [walks out of the room] 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77245,Cartman,Oh boy. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77249,Cartman,"Yeah Tolkien, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77251,Cartman,"Tolkien, calm down. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77253,Cartman,"Oh God, here we go again! [runs out of the office in a panic] "
17,5,Taming Strange,77543,Cartman,"That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77610,Cartman,"That sucks, dude. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77612,Cartman,"I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77802,Cartman,"[walks in] Hey, everyone? Excuse me! [the other kids start to turn towards him] Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up. [finally has everyone's attention] Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77804,Cartman,"I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller? [a ginger boy with dark red hair leans to his left for a better view] Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77806,Cartman,[crosses his right arm over his chest and points to the doors behind his left shoulder] Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77808,Cartman,"There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. [The camera turns right and stops at a cow with a Jewfro, glasses, a freckled face, and huge red polka dots on her body. Cartman laughs at his cleverness] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77810,Cartman,"[giggling to himself] You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77812,Cartman,"Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it! [Butters and Kevin take their phones out...] I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! [Jimmy takes out his phone...] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77814,Cartman,What? What joke? This is real! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77816,Cartman,"No, [drops down to the ground] no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77818,Cartman,"Thank you, Butters! [laughs to himself] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77821,Cartman,"Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77823,Cartman,"Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. [walks away] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77858,Cartman,"[to a reporter] Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."" "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77860,Cartman,"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. [chuckles loudly] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77880,Cartman,Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77882,Cartman,"I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77884,Cartman,"I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77886,Cartman,"[shakes his head] No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77888,Cartman,"But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank? [no reply] Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77890,Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! [picks up the house phone and starts punching] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77898,Cartman,"[gasps loudly] Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say?? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77900,Cartman,"Ohh my God! [whips out his camera phone and feigns concern] Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77902,Cartman,"[reaching his locker] Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. [opens his locker and puts a book on top of the stack. Stan, at his neighboring locker, notices] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77905,Cartman,"[puts another book on the stack] Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework, [puts a third book on the stack] gave me the soda from his lunch. [removes the second and third books he just placed on the stack] I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East. [places the third book back on the stack] Right, Kyle? [puts the second book back in the locker] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77907,Cartman,"Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77909,Cartman,You what?? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77913,Cartman,"[walks up to him] Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle. [Kyle does so, and Cartman backs up onto Kyle's face] Let's see what I can muster up here. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77915,Cartman,"Let's see. Oh! Oh! [farts, then gets off Kyle] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77928,Cartman,"[enters and clears his throat] Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77930,Cartman,"[small gasp] Kyle, are you sure? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77932,Cartman,"Well alright. [farts into his left hand and cups it over Kyle's mouth, making sure the fart goes all the way in.] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77958,Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77960,Cartman,"I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77985,Cartman,"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? [three quick farts] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77987,Cartman,Huh? You comin'? [three more quick ones] 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77989,Cartman,"Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. [leaves, screen right. Kyle stands up] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78013,Cartman,"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78015,Cartman,"Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78043,Cartman,Small penis?! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78052,Cartman,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78054,Cartman,"No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78057,Cartman,"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? [puts his hand on his ass and farts on it, then puts whipped cream on it, with a cherry on top, and smothers it on Kyle's face. He then walks away. A few seconds later, the cherry falls off] "
17,7,Black Friday,78064,Cartman,"Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick. "
17,7,Black Friday,78066,Cartman,"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it. "
17,7,Black Friday,78068,Cartman,"Thank you all for coming. Prince Tolkien, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig and mumbles coyly]. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves. "
17,7,Black Friday,78070,Cartman,What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system. 
17,7,Black Friday,78072,Cartman,"I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday. "
17,7,Black Friday,78075,Cartman,"It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole! "
17,7,Black Friday,78077,Cartman,"On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together! [pounds the table with his left fist] ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive. "
17,7,Black Friday,78088,Cartman,"[walking around, surveying his knights] Yes. Yes, very nice. Good. "
17,7,Black Friday,78090,Cartman,"[flatly, but sternly] They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters. "
17,7,Black Friday,78092,Cartman,"Okay, we need to start immediately, please. [clears his throat and reads] Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight! "
17,7,Black Friday,78095,Cartman,"But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid? "
17,7,Black Friday,78097,Cartman,"Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them. "
17,7,Black Friday,78107,Cartman,"Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it? "
17,7,Black Friday,78109,Cartman,What do you mean? 
17,7,Black Friday,78111,Cartman,"Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters. "
17,7,Black Friday,78114,Cartman,We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! [the boys cheer this good news] 
17,7,Black Friday,78118,Cartman,"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday. "
17,7,Black Friday,78120,Cartman,[chortles] What? 
17,7,Black Friday,78122,Cartman,"...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes. "
17,7,Black Friday,78126,Cartman,That's right. 
17,7,Black Friday,78131,Cartman,"We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final! "
17,7,Black Friday,78134,Cartman,"Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine! "
17,7,Black Friday,78136,Cartman,"[thinks for a moment] Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?! "
17,7,Black Friday,78145,Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. [turns around and walks away with the XBox group, with Kyle joining him. A shot of the mall as day turns to night] "
17,7,Black Friday,78161,Cartman,"Oh uh, hey guys, what's up? "
17,7,Black Friday,78163,Cartman,[to Clyde] God these guys are such dorks! 
17,7,Black Friday,78165,Cartman,"[performs the Vulcan sign for goodbye] Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right? "
17,7,Black Friday,78167,Cartman,"[to Clyde] Oh my god they're so gaaay! [to the Trekkers] Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap. "
17,7,Black Friday,78170,Cartman,"The Federation has agreed to fight with us! [the group gathers at a round table] With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size! [Kyle sadly nods in acknowledgement] You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle? "
17,7,Black Friday,78172,Cartman,"You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances. "
17,7,Black Friday,78174,Cartman,"[with his right hand over his nose] Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners. "
17,7,Black Friday,78180,Cartman,What new Elmo doll? 
17,7,Black Friday,78224,Cartman,"Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle. "
17,7,Black Friday,78226,Cartman,"I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever... [picks out a yellow rose and gives it to Kenny] switch sides, [Kenny sniffs it] it could make Stan's army problematic for us. "
17,7,Black Friday,78228,Cartman,"True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours. [stops and faces Kenny] Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors. "
17,7,Black Friday,78230,Cartman,"You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other? "
17,7,Black Friday,78233,Cartman,"Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros! "
17,7,Black Friday,78268,Cartman,"Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners! [walks further along to Kyle, who's sitting on a tree stump.] Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right? "
17,7,Black Friday,78270,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78296,Cartman,"Alright, stop, stop, stop! [leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters] This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! [swings his staff at Scott's mouth and lands it, making Scott's tongue go back in his mouth] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78298,Cartman,"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! [leaves] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78302,Cartman,"The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78304,Cartman,"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him! [they go through the sliding door] I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" [reaches his refrigerator and opens it, looking for something to consume] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78306,Cartman,"[turns around, holding a glass of milk] I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru! [takes a swig of it] Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. [leaves, forgetting to close the refrigerator door] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78308,Cartman,"Stupid asshole! [looks at a picture of himself and Kenny at Casa Bonita putting their arms around each other, with dreamy expressions, as they used to be best buds. He folds it up and lays it on his desk, face down] Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard. [lost his patience] Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78344,Cartman,"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78346,Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. [picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.] How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78348,Cartman,Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78350,Cartman,So what happens when the dragons show up? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78352,Cartman,Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny. 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78354,Cartman,Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers. 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78356,Cartman,"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78358,Cartman,[shoots back] Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78360,Cartman,Why don't you mind your own business?! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78404,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78406,Cartman,"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army [picks a rose out for Kyle], but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation. [Kyle sniffs the rose] It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be... [stops] grounded? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78408,Cartman,That could be up to you. 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78410,Cartman,"Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right. [begins walking] Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78412,Cartman,"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it? [stops and faces Kyle] Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78414,Cartman,"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78416,Cartman,Yeah! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78418,Cartman,Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78438,Cartman,"Hi, is Kenny home? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78440,Cartman,"Forward, men! [the bearers try to fit Cartman through the door, but they can't fit through. First they run into the door frame on the left side] That, no- [then on the right] No, you- You've gotta turn me. [the bearers tilt the litter some seventy degrees without Cartman falling off and finally fit through the door.] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78444,Cartman,"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78448,Cartman,"You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78451,Cartman,"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78454,Cartman,That doesn't even make sense. 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78459,Cartman,"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! [Stan and Kenny look at each other, then Stan thinks a minute] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78471,Cartman,"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78473,Cartman,"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help. [picks another yellow rose for Gates] But I hope that we're clear that this is my army. [hands the rose to him. Gates sniffs it] There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78475,Cartman,Your CEOs? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78477,Cartman,"Uhhh, hmmm. What? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78479,Cartman,Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78547,Cartman,[nose in left hand] He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and he what?? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78549,Cartman,"Because, because what? Because he's cute? "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78551,Cartman,But what does he do besides that he's cute?! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78553,Cartman,"Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom! [she turns around and goes back inside. Cartman reconsiders] Mom? [she looks back at him] Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. [she walks out of view] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78555,Cartman,"He's not a princess, he's a DUDE! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78557,Cartman,"So what are you saying, Kyle?! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78579,Cartman,"Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay? "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78581,Cartman,"Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78585,Cartman,"We know a way inside the Red Robin. [this stops Stan, Jimmy and Craig] You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78600,Cartman,"[Cartman's portrait, anime-style with a beard, voices over as Kenny reads the note inside the invitation.] Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78615,Cartman,"Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78617,Cartman,"I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. [reaches out for a yellow rose] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78619,Cartman,"Well, think about it. [hands the rose to Stan, who takes it] The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78621,Cartman,"Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through- "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78623,Cartman,Dude! Dude! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78625,Cartman,"Dude, shut the fuck up! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78627,Cartman,He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78629,Cartman,"God damn it, shut up! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78631,Cartman,"Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78633,Cartman,"Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78635,Cartman,"[sighs] Kyle thought of it. [Stan bolts out of there] Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude! [with Stan not returning, Cartman looks at Thompson] You're a fuckin' asshole! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78637,Cartman,I'll shit in your fuckin' garden! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78648,Cartman,"Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there? "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78650,Cartman,"Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78652,Cartman,"Yesh, kewl. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78654,Cartman,"Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78656,Cartman,Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78658,Cartman,"Yes, he did. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78660,Cartman,"[shushes Kyle up and walks him a few steps] It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78662,Cartman,"What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78704,Cartman,"Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s. [all cheer] And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78706,Cartman,"Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit. [leaves the table and goes to the mall-side entrance, where Clyde is keeping watch] What have you found out? "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78708,Cartman,"Oh okay, that could be a while. [turns away from the door] All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78716,Cartman,Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78718,Cartman,What the hell is this?! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78720,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78722,Cartman,"Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78725,Cartman,"Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78729,Cartman,They're not a part of your betrayal? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78731,Cartman,"No. Whose betrayal is this? [the sound of chains comes from the mall entrance - Stan locks the doors, then turns around] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78745,Cartman,"Oh dude, this is pretty sweet. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78761,Cartman,"[flatly] Yay, XBox wins. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78767,Cartman,We'd like to get XBox Ones please. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78773,Cartman,"The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78777,Cartman,You guys wanna p-play outside or something? [the boys glance around at each other. Soon the sliding door opens and the boys walk out onto the back yard] 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78779,Cartman,I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78781,Cartman,"The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play? "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78783,Cartman,"Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this. [grabs a stick from the ground] We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78785,Cartman,[holds the stick up high in the sun] Fuck 'em! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78824,Cartman,"You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78858,Cartman,[recognizing him] Uh oh. 
17,10,The Hobbit,78878,Cartman,I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet. 
17,10,The Hobbit,78880,Cartman,"Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78882,Cartman,"Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. [next shot is of Clyde walking down the hall with Lisa on his arm as he looks at his phone's screen. Everyone turns and stares at the new couple. They stop at Tolkien at his locker] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78951,Cartman,"Whoa, look at Bebe! [her picture is shown] I had no idea Bebe was that hot. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78957,Cartman,"Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79024,Cartman,Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79029,Cartman,Protruding vaginal boner. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79031,Cartman,"Oh, I like that. [the bus rolls up and the boys get on board] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79046,Cartman,Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79049,Cartman,"Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79065,Cartman,"You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys! [runs up to Stan's door and enters the house. He runs into Stan's room] You guys, I've got it! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79067,Cartman,It's the greatest startup company name EVER! [Kyle and Stan move in closer to Cartman] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79069,Cartman,Washington. Redskins. [Kyle and Stan look at each other] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79071,Cartman,It's sooo sweet! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79073,Cartman,"It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79077,Cartman,Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79079,Cartman,"Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79083,Cartman,"[climbs down the ladder and joins Stan and Kyle] It's a strong name, dude. It's like aggressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79085,Cartman,"We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys! [walks up to an easel with a 4 Point Plan on it] Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79091,Cartman,"I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79094,Cartman,"Sittin' on our asses, here we come! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79098,Cartman,"[on a video on the Kickstarter site] By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79101,Cartman,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself. [Butters walks across the room] Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our Kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79103,Cartman,"Yes, I know. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79105,Cartman,"Oh, cool. Please take a seat. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79107,Cartman,"Nice, I like that. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79109,Cartman,Stop? But why? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79111,Cartman,"Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually. [phone rings, Eric reacts] Um, Butters, could you get that? "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79114,Cartman,How is it offensive? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79118,Cartman,"Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. [grins, knowing that's not the reason.] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79120,Cartman,"Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. [the men, dejected, turn and walk out the door] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79127,Cartman,"Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79129,Cartman,"Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79131,Cartman,"Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about! [pounds the desk a couple of times.] Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are! [pound] Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79133,Cartman,"NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79135,Cartman,"It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79138,Cartman,"Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79140,Cartman,"Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!"" "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79142,Cartman,"Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle? "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79144,Cartman,Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79146,Cartman,"Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. [Kyle and Stan walk out the door. Butters begins to follow them, but stops in his tracks.] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79175,Cartman,"Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with. [An image of the office appears, with the new changes] To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting. [a pair of tits and male genitalia are added to the original logo, to much cheer and applause] Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! [cheering and applause] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79199,Cartman,"Goooood morning, guys! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79201,Cartman,"We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79203,Cartman,"[tries to visit his page, but it's not coming up] What the hell? Can't find the server? [tries again] Kickstarter.com! [not found] Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79207,Cartman,What?! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79209,Cartman,Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?! [gasps] Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79212,Cartman,You son of a bitch! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79214,Cartman,You broke Kickstarter! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79216,Cartman,Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79218,Cartman,"Well, somebody did! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79221,Cartman,"[shocked] A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! [begins walking out the door] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79223,Cartman,[steps forward] It is really sweet. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79228,Cartman,"Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks! [the cheering and applause die down] How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79230,Cartman,"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. [The neo logo comes up - it's two of the old logo, with titties and balls and penises, one taking the other from behind. This receives cheers and applause] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79263,Cartman,I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. [a brick flies in through a window and shards flow into the room] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79266,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa! What? "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79279,Cartman,"[sighs and his voice drops] I guess we gotta go back to school. [they boys turn left and walk away, their heads hanging down. The protesters keep cheering until they're gone.] "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79283,Cartman,"How's it going, everybody? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79285,Cartman,"Hey dude. Sup? [they encounter Tolkien, Craig, and Jimmy.] "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79287,Cartman,What do you mean? We're just... going to school. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79292,Cartman,"Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was- "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79307,Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at us. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79310,Cartman,"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79336,Cartman,"You know what we gotta do, guys? [gets off the bleachers] We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79338,Cartman,Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79340,Cartman,"Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79342,Cartman,"Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for... "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79344,Cartman,What? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79346,Cartman,We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79349,Cartman,"Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79351,Cartman,So who do we throw the party for? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79356,Cartman,"You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79358,Cartman,"You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79362,Cartman,"""I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."" "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79367,Cartman,"Believe it, dude. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79379,Cartman,What the hell is gluten? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79418,Cartman,KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79420,Cartman,"THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79422,Cartman,KYYYLE! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79437,Cartman,What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79439,Cartman,What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79442,Cartman,You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79444,Cartman,"[turns to his right side] There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79499,Cartman,Aunt Jemima. [stands up and walks over] 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79501,Cartman,"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79503,Cartman,I don't even know what that means. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79505,Cartman,Are you going to eat those pancakes? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79507,Cartman,"Oooo, trippy... "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79509,Cartman,"They've got what backward? [everything vanishes into a gray field, then a golden triangle appears, then shatters. A kaleidoscope of kids appears, taunting him. Aunt Jemima's face shatters, revealing the golden triangle.] "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79510,Cartman,"[he falls through his dream, surrounded by everything that has gluten in it] Noooo... [and suddenly wakes up] Oh! Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck, I want pancakes. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79547,Cartman,KYYYLE! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79549,Cartman,"KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMID! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79554,Cartman,My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79556,Cartman,"What, what is it? What is it for? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79560,Cartman,It's upside down. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79562,Cartman,"Sir, the pyramid is upside down. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79578,Cartman,"Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79580,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. [takes a couple of steps and notices the ghost of Aunt Jemima over a fence. He waves at her. She waves back.] "
18,3,The Cissy,79593,Cartman,"[thinking] Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago. [looks down at Stan's feet, than at Kyle's] Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all. [Stan notices and looks. Cartman notices Stan and shoves his hand further into his pocket. Stan looks at Cartman and steps away from him.] I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! [Kyle notices Cartman's anger] "
18,3,The Cissy,79595,Cartman,"[brightens up] Yeah, I'm good. How are you, Kyle? [settles into angry funk again and thinks] They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time. [Kyle and Kenny look at each other, then they look at Cartman] We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess. "
18,3,The Cissy,79598,Cartman,"Good for you. [tries to get into the first stall, but finds it locked] "
18,3,The Cissy,79600,Cartman,"No, God damn it, no! [pounds on the door] Who's takin' a shit?! "
18,3,The Cissy,79602,Cartman,"I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig! "
18,3,The Cissy,79604,Cartman,"Son of a bitch! [moves on to Stall 2, tries to open it, and finds it locked too.] Oh, no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time! "
18,3,The Cissy,79606,Cartman,"ALL RIGHT, THAT DOES IT! [turns around and walks toward the door]I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT AND I'M NOT [throws his magazines to the floor] GONNA BE TAKING IT ANY LONGER! [reaches into his jacket pocket] You all pushed me to this! [pulls out a pink bow and plops it on to his hat, then continues out the door. Butters just looks on. Cartman leaves the boys' room and enters the girls' room. Wendy and Bebe are at the mirror. Cartman looks around for a moment. Wendy is quick to notice, and then faces him. Cartman heads for a stall and Wendy blocks him] "
18,3,The Cissy,79608,Cartman,I'm going to the potty. 
18,3,The Cissy,79610,Cartman,"Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger. "
18,3,The Cissy,79612,Cartman,"Did you notice the bow? [points to it] I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way, I have to take a shit. [barges into Stall 1, locks it, drops his pants, and sits down. Wendy shrugs with her palms up. The first poop falls and Wendy and Bebe recoil] Aaahhh! "
18,3,The Cissy,79614,Cartman,"Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy! [drops another deuce] Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls' bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys'. [groans to get another deuce out, followed by a fart. Red comes out of Stall 2] "
18,3,The Cissy,79617,Cartman,"Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls' bathroom a long time ago. "
18,3,The Cissy,79619,Cartman,"It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. [farts and poops some more] "
18,3,The Cissy,79622,Cartman,Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter. 
18,3,The Cissy,79624,Cartman,"Yeah uh-huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy, but I'm really a girl. "
18,3,The Cissy,79626,Cartman,That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws. 
18,3,The Cissy,79628,Cartman,Erica. 
18,3,The Cissy,79630,Cartman,"All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers. "
18,3,The Cissy,79665,Cartman,"There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead. "
18,3,The Cissy,79667,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls. "
18,3,The Cissy,79669,Cartman,"Okay, okay, okay, you guys! You know what? You know what? [drops a deuce] That's what. [laughs his ass off. Principal Victoria walks in behind the girls] Suck my clit and balls. "
18,3,The Cissy,79671,Cartman,"I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. [poops and farts] "
18,3,The Cissy,79673,Cartman,"Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom? "
18,3,The Cissy,79675,Cartman,OH MY GOD!!! 
18,3,The Cissy,79678,Cartman,"Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location. "
18,3,The Cissy,79680,Cartman,"Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out. "
18,3,The Cissy,79682,Cartman,Oh on that side? 
18,3,The Cissy,79684,Cartman,"Oh, I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah. "
18,3,The Cissy,79715,Cartman,"[rushes up] It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go. [opens the door, looks inside and grins. Inside is one of the fanciest restrooms one will ever see. Icicle lights all around, waterfall to the left, fancy commode to the right, plush towels and toilet seat cover. Triumphant music plays] Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome. [closes and locks the door] Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good! [claps twice - he's got the Clapper feature in there. The lights dim and Vivaldi's Spring begins to play] Perfect. [reaches over for a cat-o-five-tails and begins whipping the toilet with it] Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide. [the kids nearby just stand there shocked] You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready! [remembers there are people outside] Oh my God, this is so awesome, you guys! It's just like at home! "
18,3,The Cissy,79731,Cartman,"Yup! You know what Hillary says: ""You can suck my clit and balls."" [goes into his bathroom] "
18,3,The Cissy,79740,Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied! "
18,3,The Cissy,79742,Cartman,"DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM! "
18,3,The Cissy,79744,Cartman,"I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment! "
18,3,The Cissy,79746,Cartman,"Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy! "
18,3,The Cissy,79748,Cartman,BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO! 
18,3,The Cissy,79750,Cartman,"NO! I IDENTIFY AS A CHICK, BUT I'M STILL A BOY. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SHARE A BATHROOM WITH A GIRL THAT IDENTIFIES HERSELF AS A FUCKING DUDE! [thinks for a few seconds] That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights! "
18,3,The Cissy,79752,Cartman,[runs up to Stan] Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog! 
18,3,The Cissy,79754,Cartman,"Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?! [Stan looks around] Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! STAN-AN'S A GIR-RL! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! [walks away] "
18,3,The Cissy,79780,Cartman,"HEY, WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT! "
18,3,The Cissy,79782,Cartman,Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?! 
18,3,The Cissy,79785,Cartman,He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night! 
18,3,The Cissy,79801,Cartman,"Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?! "
18,3,The Cissy,79803,Cartman,"At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?! [the other kids agree, but not strongly] What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies! "
18,3,The Cissy,79806,Cartman,"Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?! "
18,3,The Cissy,79815,Cartman,I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. [pulls off his bow and throws it to the ground.] 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80081,Cartman,"[opens Butters' door and enters] Hey, douchebag, are you doing anything kewl? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80083,Cartman,"[heads for Butters' bed] Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl! [gets on Butters' bed and lays down on his back.] I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80085,Cartman,"No, it isn't. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80087,Cartman,That's stupid. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80089,Cartman,I'm dying of boredom. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80091,Cartman,"[sits up, suddenly interested] What did you say? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80093,Cartman,Your dad has a fucking drone? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80095,Cartman,Whooaa! [runs up to it for a closer look] 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80097,Cartman,[pulls his finger back and smiles at Butters] You wanna take it out for a spin? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80099,Cartman,[runs up to Butters and stands next to him] Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80101,Cartman,"Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80103,Cartman,"Okay, good idea. [picks up the drone] We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80106,Cartman,"Oh, shit, it's your dad! Go, go, go! [leaves the garage with the drone as Butters faces the source of the call, then pulls down the garage door] I'll see you later at my house. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80110,Cartman,"Butters, is that you? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80112,Cartman,"[opens the door just a crack and peeks out] Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80114,Cartman,"Alright, come in. [opens the door to reveal Kenny] Kenny's here; I told him all about it. [Kenny waves hello] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80116,Cartman,"It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out. [outside, the drone sits in the grass in the backyard, 50 feet away from the house. Suddenly it rises to 23 feet, above the boys' heads, then veers to the right] Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! [the drone's camera shows some backyards through a fish-eye lens. A dog barks up at it from below.] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80118,Cartman,"Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards! [in the distance, Kenny's house is shown from the back two blocks away. The drone veers to the right and drops down a bit, headed for a back door] Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80121,Cartman,"Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh. [Craig is shown at his computer. The drone moves to the next window and shows Craig's mom undressing.] Craig's mom is taking off her clothes. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80124,Cartman,"Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80127,Cartman,"This thing is recording, right? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80129,Cartman,"Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that? [Craig's mom has heard the drone and called her husband Thomas over. She stands behind him as they both look at the drone outside their window] Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! [thrusts the controller at Butters] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80131,Cartman,His dad sees you! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80133,Cartman,"Fly back to the house, stupid! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80154,Cartman,"Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80156,Cartman,"Not a word, Kenny! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80161,Cartman,"Hey, you guys. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80163,Cartman,You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80166,Cartman,"Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? [whips out his phone] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80169,Cartman,You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80172,Cartman,"[shows Stan] Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80174,Cartman,"Oh. Um, uh... Kenny? [motions for Kenny to get closer, but Kenny doesn't budge] Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80177,Cartman,"I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80185,Cartman,"Whoa, Butters, chillax, bro. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80187,Cartman,Butters- 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80189,Cartman,Butters. Butters. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80191,Cartman,"Butters, I had to! [Butters lets him go] Okay, I had to put it on the Internet! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80193,Cartman,"Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80195,Cartman,"Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! [they leave the restroom. Stall 1 opens and Kyle steps out, angry at what he just heard] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80216,Cartman,What? [the drone returns and goes the other way] 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80218,Cartman,What does that have to do with me? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80220,Cartman,"Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80222,Cartman,You were what?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80224,Cartman,You were spying on me?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80226,Cartman,"But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80228,Cartman,"You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! [another drone hovers by] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80259,Cartman,Butters. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80261,Cartman,"Because, Butters- "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80263,Cartman,"[brushes Butters' hands off his jacket] Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay- [stops and kneels down to see if there's anyone in the stall, then gets up again] Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80265,Cartman,"Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."" "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80267,Cartman,"Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80308,Cartman,Oh hey Butters. Sup? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80310,Cartman,"Dude, what's the matter? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80312,Cartman,"Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. [takes Butters in and closes the door] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80314,Cartman,Butters. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80316,Cartman,"[while Butters speaks] Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80318,Cartman,"Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80320,Cartman,"Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80322,Cartman,Your dad's drone. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80324,Cartman,"Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80329,Cartman,"[with the controller] Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80331,Cartman,"It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. [he gets the drone going. It rises, pulling behind it a blow-up doll made to resemble Laura, with a large bushy wig over the crotch. The drone and doll hover away from Cartman's house.] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80339,Cartman,"Well, you see, Butters, everything worked out. [Butters doesn't respond] ""Oh, thank you, Eric. I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."" "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80341,Cartman,"[taken aback, then sighs] Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80343,Cartman,You're welcome. [the minstrel begins to sing again] 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80365,Cartman,[approaching wit Kenny] What are you two boners doing? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80367,Cartman,"[""I played that thing it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks. ""]"
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80423,Cartman,"How much money did you micropay today, Stan? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80427,Cartman,Yes. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80430,Cartman,Jimmy told me about this game. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80434,Cartman,The?! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80448,Cartman,Everyone we know says they heard about it from you! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80450,Cartman,It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80489,Cartman,[approaches Jimmy and grabs him by the shirt collar] And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80493,Cartman,That makes sense. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80520,Cartman,It's done. [he had been texting on his phone] 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80522,Cartman,"The word is out. [shows him the phone] ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it. [glances at his phone's screen] It's trending. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80599,Cartman,Cool. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80616,Cartman,"[hidden around the corner, in front of the camera] That's awesome, Butters. [snickers away from the walkie-talkie] Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? [snickers away from the walkie-talkie] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80620,Cartman,"Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I- [mutes the walkie-talkie and whispers] He's so fucking stupid. [un-mutes it] But I'm sure they will soon. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80622,Cartman,"[watching him from around the corner] Butters, no! Are you crazy?! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80624,Cartman,What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub?? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80626,Cartman,"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80628,Cartman,You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that?? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80630,Cartman,"You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies, Butters. You have to hurry! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80634,Cartman,"Alright Butters, sit down at the computer. [Butters does this] Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80636,Cartman,"Welcome back, dude. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80638,Cartman,How do you feel? Do you feel okay? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80641,Cartman,"And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back."" [pounds his left fist on the table] Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80643,Cartman,"Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80645,Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80647,Cartman,"Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80649,Cartman,"Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80651,Cartman,"Right Butters. [softly over his left shoulder] These guys are so dumb, huh? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80653,Cartman,See? He's an asshole. Fuck him. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80655,Cartman,"Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80657,Cartman,Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. [hands him the headset and Butters puts it on.] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80659,Cartman,"[picks up the walkie-talkie] Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now. [presses a few keys on the keyboard] Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80661,Cartman,"[turns off the room light so the fluorescent lights stand out] Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, [raises the shield]Mark. [quickly hides in the closet as Butters gets accustomed to the headset again] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80663,Cartman,"All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80665,Cartman,"Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80669,Cartman,You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80671,Cartman,"Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80673,Cartman,"Just take the money, Butters! [Butters reaches for the bill and takes it.] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80675,Cartman,"You got the money? [Butters walks down the walkway as the lady closes the front door] Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80677,Cartman,"Yeah, Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back. [eats some more chips] Are you heading back Butters? [no reply.] Butters? [Butters goes home] Alright, Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80687,Cartman,"[getting worried] Uh, Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80690,Cartman,"Butters, it's, uhh, time to stop. Get back to my place. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80694,Cartman,"Oh shit! [runs outside] Butters! Butters, where are you now? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80696,Cartman,"Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80698,Cartman,"Wait, hang on Butters! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80702,Cartman,Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80704,Cartman,Butters?? Butters?? [turns the walkie-talkie off] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80712,Cartman,"Butters. [Butters looks to his right. Dramatic camera pan from Butters to Cartman, who stands on the window sill like Morpheus] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80714,Cartman,Are you okay? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80716,Cartman,"I'm not here, Butters. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80718,Cartman,"This is going to be hard to understand, Butters, [climbs down to the floor] but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this... [spreads his arms out] is real. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80720,Cartman,"Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. [pulls off the missing thumb trick.] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80722,Cartman,"You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. [pulls out a wand from his sleeve and produces a bouquet of flowers from it] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80724,Cartman,"Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80726,Cartman,[pressing a buzzer] How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? [hides under the bed] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80730,Cartman,Butters. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80732,Cartman,"I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! [performs another trick in which he gets a coin inside a glass bottle... and succeeds] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80736,Cartman,I'm happy that I totally got away with it. [gets a call] What's a 911 area code? Hello? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80738,Cartman,With what? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80740,Cartman,[slowly] Fuck you! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80743,Cartman,"Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80745,Cartman,"Guys, tell him you're not computer programs. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80747,Cartman,"[sighs and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment] Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80749,Cartman,Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! [Well...] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80756,Cartman,Are you fucking with me?! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80758,Cartman,"Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80760,Cartman,"Because if you are, it's not cool! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80762,Cartman,"Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80764,Cartman,"Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80766,Cartman,That's right! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80768,Cartman,"THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80770,Cartman,"Well if you get grounded in virtual reality, you get grounded in real life too... FOREVER! [Butters is alarmed] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80818,Cartman,"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. [the doorbell rings and he answers. It's Kyle.] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80820,Cartman,I know. Let's go to the backyard. [turns and walks to the backyard. Kyle is quite surprised by Cartman's reaction. Moments later they takes seats at the picnic table out back. A butterfly floats by] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80822,Cartman,Okay Kyle. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80824,Cartman,"Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80826,Cartman,"[laces his fingers together, with his index fingers making a steeple in front of his lips] Mmmhmm. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80828,Cartman,"And why did the guys send you, Kyle? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80830,Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80832,Cartman,"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80834,Cartman,Calm down. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80836,Cartman,"In virtual reality, yes you did. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80838,Cartman,"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80840,Cartman,[defeated] Fuck! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80844,Cartman,Or if I did? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80849,Cartman,What? [takes the phone from Kyle] Hello? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80851,Cartman,Dude. NOW this is getting weird! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80863,Cartman,"[still lost] No, you guys. This is virtual reality. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80865,Cartman,Because... I'm a computer program. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80867,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80869,Cartman,I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80899,Cartman,"You guys! [the boys look at him] I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80932,Cartman,"Alright, Stan, just sit down at the computer. [Stan does this] "
18,8,Cock Magic,80940,Cartman,[takes a flier] What's this? 
18,8,Cock Magic,80942,Cartman,"[looks at Craig.] Girls volleyball? [they both laugh at the thought] Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80944,Cartman,"Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay? [hands the flier back to girl 1] All right. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80949,Cartman,"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80954,Cartman,This asshole needs to make a move already! 
18,8,Cock Magic,80962,Cartman,He's playing an enchantment. 
18,8,Cock Magic,80971,Cartman,"Dude, it was complete brutality! "
18,8,Cock Magic,80974,Cartman,"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro! "
18,8,Cock Magic,80980,Cartman,"Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this! [the janitor finally looks at the group] It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive! "
18,8,Cock Magic,80982,Cartman,"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80986,Cartman,[steps forward and watches him leave] Kewwwl! 
18,8,Cock Magic,80989,Cartman,What's hardcore and exciting about Shitty shrimp? [they approach the doors] 
18,8,Cock Magic,80995,Cartman,"Dude, do we look like police? "
18,8,Cock Magic,80997,Cartman,"Five dorrah?! [Mr. Lu Kim hushes them quickly and leads them to the back room, which leads to the basement. Lu Kim opens the basement door] "
18,8,Cock Magic,81006,Cartman,"Dude, that was total carnage! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81008,Cartman,Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81011,Cartman,"We're going again on Friday, right? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81013,Cartman,What's the matter Kenny? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81017,Cartman,You feel bad for the roosters? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81021,Cartman,"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81023,Cartman,Huh? A little bit? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81027,Cartman,"What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. [Kenny just looks at his meal] "
18,8,Cock Magic,81047,Cartman,"Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81057,Cartman,"Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81059,Cartman,"Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81063,Cartman,"What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81065,Cartman,"[mimicking a rooster] ""Yes I do, you guys."" [normally] Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81083,Cartman,"[through gritted teeth] Come on, McNuggets! Fight! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81090,Cartman,"All right, McNuggets! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81092,Cartman,"[carrying McNuggets in a small cage] That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls' volleyball. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81094,Cartman,Thank you so very much. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81099,Cartman,"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81116,Cartman,"We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81121,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, give it a rest already. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81125,Cartman,OOHHH!! [laughs with the other boys] 
18,8,Cock Magic,81129,Cartman,"[aside, to Stan] Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81146,Cartman,"Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. [they stand before Panda Express. Again, Kyle knocks on the doors and tugs at them.] "
18,8,Cock Magic,81148,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81150,Cartman,Ten dorrah?! [the boys hand over $10 each] 
18,8,Cock Magic,81153,Cartman,Who is that?? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81157,Cartman,"Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81159,Cartman,"McNuggets is scared, dude! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81166,Cartman,This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81168,Cartman,"Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81173,Cartman,"Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81178,Cartman,"Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81180,Cartman,Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81192,Cartman,"Ah, dude, your dad's here. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81202,Cartman,"It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hand that the fucking cops had to come and break it up. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81205,Cartman,"Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny? "
18,9,REHASH,81239,Cartman,"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how? "
18,9,REHASH,81262,Cartman,"Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. [a recording of the earlier conversation plays] "
18,9,REHASH,81264,Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan. "
18,9,REHASH,81266,Cartman,"[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what. "
18,9,REHASH,81269,Cartman,There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY! 
18,9,REHASH,81287,Cartman,"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. "

18,9,REHASH,81297,Cartman,"God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah! "
18,9,REHASH,81302,Cartman,Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick. 
18,9,REHASH,81304,Cartman,I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop. 
18,9,REHASH,81308,Cartman,"Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented ""Let's Plays"", Kyle. "
18,9,REHASH,81310,Cartman,"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. [turns to the basket and takes his shot. Kyle looks away and down] "
18,9,REHASH,81341,Cartman,"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah! "
18,9,REHASH,81364,Cartman,CartmaaanBrah! 
18,9,REHASH,81366,Cartman,"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well. "
18,9,REHASH,81368,Cartman,CartmaaanBrah! 
18,9,REHASH,81370,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs. "
18,9,REHASH,81433,Cartman,"Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now. [the other three boys walk into view] Yep, there's Kyle, Stan and Kenny looking stupid as ever. "
18,9,REHASH,81436,Cartman,"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah! "
18,9,REHASH,81438,Cartman,[exasperated] Oh God.

18,9,REHASH,81442,Cartman,"Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah! "
18,9,REHASH,81457,Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up] Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake. "
18,9,REHASH,81460,Cartman,Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants! 
18,9,REHASH,81462,Cartman,"This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison. "
18,9,REHASH,81464,Cartman,"Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch. "
18,9,REHASH,81467,Cartman,[mocking] There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying. 
18,9,REHASH,81471,Cartman,"[mocking] This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something. "
18,9,REHASH,81473,Cartman,What the hell did I do? 
18,9,REHASH,81476,Cartman,Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things. 
18,9,REHASH,81478,Cartman,Adults so don't get what's cool anymore. 
18,9,REHASH,81490,Cartman,"[in his commenter window] Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah! "

18,10,HappyHolograms,81495,Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up on screen] Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81560,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew? "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81563,Cartman,He's such a douchebag. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81565,Cartman,Now we're talkin'! [the commenter window disappears and Stan and Kyle are stunned] 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81573,Cartman,"Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. [eats some chips] "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81577,Cartman,"Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81582,Cartman,"No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81584,Cartman,"I can hear you, douchebag. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81586,Cartman,These guys are such blumpkin catchers. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81588,Cartman,G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81641,Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up] Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81643,Cartman,"What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81645,Cartman,How do you even know I'm here in my room? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81647,Cartman,"...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions. [Kyle tries breaking his way into the room] You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. [Kyle stops] "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81649,Cartman,Why does that matter? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81651,Cartman,What? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81654,Cartman,"Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. [the commenter window disappears] "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81673,Cartman,"Oh, this should be good. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81675,Cartman,I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81677,Cartman,"Hoh, this should get some comments. [Kurt's hologram fires the rifle and a small flag saying ""Merry Christmas"" pops out. He grins] "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81707,Cartman,"Oh bros, weak! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81712,Cartman,"Oh weak, bros, so weak! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81736,Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Oh wow, where are we now, brahs? [the family looks at him] This looks pretty stupid. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81738,Cartman,CartmaanBrah! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81745,Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81749,Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81756,Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Happy holidays, everyone! [the cops stop laughing and look at the window] Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81759,Cartman,"Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81763,Cartman,"I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Depp, but cool. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81765,Cartman,"It's all CartmanBrah now. [a shot of Times Square. Cartman's image replaces everything else on the screens there] I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender. [a shot of the Times Square crowd, looking at the screens in disbelief] Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81783,Cartman,"Hey! What's going on? What is that? [amid some special effects of snow and holly popping out of the upper right corner of screens everywhere, PewDiePie's commenter window appears] "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81785,Cartman,What the hell?! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81789,Cartman,"Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81791,Cartman,"Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81793,Cartman,Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh... 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81795,Cartman,No! You can't do this! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81797,Cartman,"God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81799,Cartman,"NOOOO! [his commenter window disappears, as well as the holiday special] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81812,Cartman,Sweet dude! 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81893,Cartman,I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81896,Cartman,[sighs heavily] Tom Brady. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81898,Cartman,Deny and subvert. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81901,Cartman,Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81904,Cartman,A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81905,Cartman,"[pacing back and forth] You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81907,Cartman,"I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say ""You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!"" "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81909,Cartman,"NO! No, to hell with that! ""You're giving me NO days detention! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!"" [marches off] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81911,Cartman,"[turns around] Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. [walks off] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81916,Cartman,"Oh, PC Principal, how are you today? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81918,Cartman,"You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81920,Cartman,"It's just a request, that's all. See you around. [stops and looks down] Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal. [picks it up] What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear. [sniffs at it] Why, this is Butters' underwear. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81922,Cartman,"PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now... [drops it into the urinal and soaks it in PC Principal's urine - the principal had not flushed the urinal - and pulls the briefs out.] Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it. [through some windows above the urinal, Kyle, Butters, Craig, Stan, and Tolkien watch the action unfold] This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capiche? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81924,Cartman,You mean about keeping your dick out? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81926,Cartman,"Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81928,Cartman,"Okay, let's back up. [...and slams him against the stall] Aaah! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81930,Cartman,AAHH! 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81932,Cartman,"[quuickly] No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81934,Cartman,Oh God! 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81960,Cartman,"[with raspy voice] We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81962,Cartman,"There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81966,Cartman,No way. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81968,Cartman,"Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81970,Cartman,"If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81972,Cartman,"[In added pain] Aaahh, aahh! [looks left at Kyle] Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. [reaches out to Kyle] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81974,Cartman,"No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81976,Cartman,No. I'm going to call you... my friend. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81978,Cartman,I... guess we never realized how bad he really was. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82008,Cartman,Ack! Butters! 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82010,Cartman,"Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82012,Cartman,I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82027,Cartman,"OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk. [thinks a moment] How is everybody doing? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82029,Cartman,Who? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82031,Cartman,[soft music plays] ...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? [begins removing his hospital clothes slowly and replacing them with his own clothes] 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82033,Cartman,I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82035,Cartman,"I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero, [clears his throat] but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82046,Cartman,"All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! [Butters, with a semaphore flag in each hand, gives the signal for the women to rush the house] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82049,Cartman,"Fire the taco launchers! [the boys load the launchers and let fly. Tacos rain down upon the frat house. The women arrive and run into the house, picking up tacos on the way] Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! [a truck load of Syrian refugee children is waiting for the truck bed to empty out. Butters releases the cargo door and the kids flood out towards the house] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82052,Cartman,"[looking through some binoculars] The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! [Jared appears with his arms stretched out, ready to grab anything. He follows the women and the kids into the frat house, but doesn't grab anyone. The rest of the neighborhood gathers and marches towards the house] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82054,Cartman,"All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos. [sees Jared on the balcony trying to grab some kids, and some bros stop Jared] Jared needs backup, send in the Chinese drivers. [a split second later two cars crash into each other in front of the house.] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82056,Cartman,"All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! Gimme a- Oh fuck, there's Kyle. [lowers his binoculars] What the fuck are you doing, Kyle? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82067,Cartman,"Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue. [Kyle lowers his eyelids and the others back away] What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82069,Cartman,"Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude. [Cartman hums his own version of the end theme song over the credits.] "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82108,Cartman,"You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82110,Cartman,Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in? 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82112,Cartman,And he's sitting right here. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82119,Cartman,"[interrupting] Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82121,Cartman,"Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82123,Cartman,But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82126,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm out. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82148,Cartman,"Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock! "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82151,Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82153,Cartman,"You know, what's that story about the two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82155,Cartman,"[snaps his fingers and points to Butters] Yes, Lion King II. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82158,Cartman,"Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now? [all quiet] Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?! [the other boys look back at Kyle angrily, and Kyle is left speechless] This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82190,Cartman,What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82192,Cartman,"All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82194,Cartman,"Okay, Bu-Butters, relax. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82196,Cartman,Okay. Do you just want a race war? 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82198,Cartman,"Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82202,Cartman,[satisfied with the way Butters interaction is playing out. To himself] And start a pride all of our own. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82218,Cartman,Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet? 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82220,Cartman,"Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby! "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82222,Cartman,"Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! [hangs up. Butters returns to Charlotte] "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82299,Cartman,Dude! 
19,3,The City Part of Town,82309,Cartman,Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people. 
19,3,The City Part of Town,82311,Cartman,"No. [steps forward] Hey, we are not bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin! "
19,3,The City Part of Town,82313,Cartman,"We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! [Kyle is about to defend Kenny, but Stan speaks up] "
19,3,The City Part of Town,82465,Cartman,Are the Mexicans actually staying? 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82495,Cartman,"Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82497,Cartman,"Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard. [whips out his phone] I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82499,Cartman,"[wiping his mouth clean with his napkin] Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82501,Cartman,"Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82503,Cartman,"Great, and can you turn down the music a bit? [taps his left ear a few times] This pagan shit hurts my ears. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82505,Cartman,"Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor. [snaps his fingers and whistles] Busboy! "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82507,Cartman,Ehexcuse me? 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82509,Cartman,"Uhh, it's actually pronounced ""David,"" okay? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82511,Cartman,"It's ""David,"" dude. Look it up. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82517,Cartman,Mmmhmmm! [The father takes them to a booth near Cartman] 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82521,Cartman,"Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82524,Cartman,"[wearing a T-shirt that says ""WARNING: YELP critic"" on the front] Here you go. [takes a bag out of his back pocket and hands it to Butters] "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82526,Cartman,Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82528,Cartman,"I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82531,Cartman,EEWW. [Kyle and David face him] What's the busboy doing here? 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82533,Cartman,"Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school? [mimics a boy on a bicycle] Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82535,Cartman,"Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant 2 stars, but it could have been worse. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82537,Cartman,"I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82539,Cartman,"It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82541,Cartman,David. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82543,Cartman,David. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82545,Cartman,"David David David David! I can update this to a 1-star review in two seconds, dude. [David turns around and walks away. Kyle turns around, looks at Cartman, and follows David away. A few second later Cartman relaxes] ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82561,Cartman,"Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82564,Cartman,"Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only [emphasis] 1 star late. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82566,Cartman,Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82570,Cartman,"Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82572,Cartman,"What? I just want to hear him say ""Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool."" "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82574,Cartman,"[laughs] That's awesome! [turns around on the bench] I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. [leaves the table. David leaves his seat] "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82604,Cartman,"Hm hm hm the fuck? [notices a small puddle on the floor] Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor! [notices David at his locker] Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David. [whistles] Over here, there's some shit on the floor. [David closes his locker and turns away] Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82606,Cartman,"What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little ""My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool"" "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82609,Cartman,"[whips out his phone] Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it. [waits for a comeback but doesn't get one] You'd better say ""I ride me bicicleta to school""! [holds up his phone] One star! ... No s-no stars? [no reply. He sighs and tries again] No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys! [walks away. No one follows him. Seconds later he's back.] Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's kewl, you guys stay here. [leaves again] "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82612,Cartman,"[hops onto Butters' bed and lays down] It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82614,Cartman,All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82616,Cartman,I guess. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82618,Cartman,"[sits up] You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82630,Cartman,"Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82632,Cartman,"It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! [she goes away as he walks to the front door. He opens the door and sees a sea of reviewers] "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82635,Cartman,Fuuuuuuck! [closes the door and keeps it closed with his back] Mom! 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82637,Cartman,"But Mom, there's like a billion people here. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82639,Cartman,"Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?! "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82641,Cartman,"Mom, there's a fucking billion people here! [yes, Yelpers all up and down the block, filling the streets all around. Moments later, he appears at his bedroom window on the second floor, and holds court] Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized- "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82643,Cartman,Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82645,Cartman,"Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic. [Sgt. Yates puffs up his chest, pretty sure that it's him] It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82648,Cartman,"Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following [holds up index finger] one captain, we can fight to get our power back! "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82650,Cartman,"So now rise up, and [pounds on the window sill] fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter! "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82660,Cartman,[just shrugs] It didn't do well with Yelpers. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82662,Cartman,"Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82664,Cartman,"Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82667,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word! [softly] And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82687,Cartman,"Oh, hello David! [Cartman is flanked by hundreds of Helpers] "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82697,Cartman,"...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? [more chatter] "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82745,Cartman,"Why thank you, David. That's good service. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82747,Cartman,"Mmmm, is that a jalapeño cream sauce? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82749,Cartman,"Hmmm. It's tart, but savory. "
19,5,Safe Space,82766,Cartman,"[voice shaking terribly] Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat. "
19,5,Safe Space,82768,Cartman,"I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by [Craig and Clyde appear around the corner] Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids [Clyde] if he would take a picture of me [holding two dumbbells, one in each hand] and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in ""Don't I look ripped?"" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and [is overcome with emotion and hyperventilates. PC Principal sniffs and clears his throat.] "
19,5,Safe Space,82801,Cartman,I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time [gathers his thoughts] so you'd probably do a really good job. 
19,5,Safe Space,82813,Cartman,I'm not a joke! 
19,5,Safe Space,82817,Cartman,I wanted someone smart and hard-working! 
19,5,Safe Space,82843,Cartman,There you are. You have my social media comments? 
19,5,Safe Space,82845,Cartman,"[reviews them] Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments? "
19,5,Safe Space,82847,Cartman,"Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great! [turns around and walks by Kyle, who's at his locker.] Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now. "
19,5,Safe Space,82874,Cartman,Butters! 
19,5,Safe Space,82876,Cartman,"[at the bedroom door] What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says ""This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!"" "
19,5,Safe Space,82878,Cartman,What new people? [walks up to the computer] 
19,5,Safe Space,82880,Cartman,"Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed! "
19,5,Safe Space,82882,Cartman,"Butters, I want this fixed by tonight! You got that?! "
19,5,Safe Space,82896,Cartman, Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.   
19,5,Safe Space,82898,Cartman," [eating in a restaurant, Butters hands him more comments] People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe spaaaace. [An exhausted Butters is hard at work in his room]   "
19,5,Safe Space,82903,Cartman, Bully-proof windows.   
19,5,Safe Space,82908,Cartman, People that support me.   
19,5,Safe Space,82910,Cartman, More people that support me.   
19,5,Safe Space,82913,Cartman, Bully-proof windows. [a change in tempo as villianous music plays and a masked villain enters the video.]   
19,5,Safe Space,82915,Cartman, What? Who is that?   
19,5,Safe Space,82918,Cartman," I'll take care of him, Demi! [shoots lightning from his hands, and the various people in their safe spaces are now dressed to dance!]   "
19,5,Safe Space,82920,Cartman, Our safe spaces will keep you out!   
19,5,Safe Space,82923,Cartman, But Reality we can do without!   
19,5,Safe Space,82925,Cartman, Bully-proof windows.   
19,5,Safe Space,82927,Cartman,That was nice. 
19,5,Safe Space,82971,Cartman,"Hey, Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83023,Cartman,Uh oh. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83093,Cartman,"[thinking] Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83095,Cartman,"I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83097,Cartman,"I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83099,Cartman,"Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83104,Cartman,"Did you do it, Cupid-Me? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83106,Cartman,[laughs] That's awesome! [chuckles as Cupid-Me flits to his left side] That's so sweet. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83108,Cartman,"Yeah, dude. You're hilarious. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83110,Cartman,"[his smile vanishes] Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83112,Cartman,Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83117,Cartman,"[runs up to them] You guys! You guys, hurry! "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83119,Cartman,"It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! [runs off. Stan and Kyle follow.] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83125,Cartman,"Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room. [Craig and Tweek start fighting. Soon Cartman grabs onto Kevin for support] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83147,Cartman,"[sets his phone down, takes the bouquet, and reads the attached note.] ""Can't we just try? Tee Hee."" Oh man. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83149,Cartman,Someone who needs a real talking to. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83151,Cartman,"Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83153,Cartman,You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83155,Cartman,"I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me. [the smile leaves Cupid Me's face. Cartman's voice gets quieter] This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. [dejected, Cupid Me goes limp in mid-air.] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83219,Cartman,"What are you doing? This place isn't you. [Cupid Me is shown, with a mug of beer an empty scotch glass, and an ashtray full of cigarette butts.] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83221,Cartman,No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83223,Cartman,Fuck you. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83226,Cartman,"The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83228,Cartman,[hushed shouting] I'm not homosexual! 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83230,Cartman,"Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83233,Cartman,"Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? [the bartender doesn't see any friend with him] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83282,Cartman,"[in bed, moaning in a rhythmic fashion] Okay, okay, the date's almost over. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83284,Cartman,It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83286,Cartman,"Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight! "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83288,Cartman,"Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God! [next, he's in the bathroom. Liane walks past, but stops to listen in] Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it! [Liane opens the door and sees Cartman masturbating furiously on the toilet] That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. [Liane closes the door] "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83340,Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay! [Butters catches up] They're totally gay! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83342,Cartman,Kenny and Tolkien. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83344,Cartman,"Kenny and Tolkien, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83346,Cartman,"No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Tolkien turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83348,Cartman,"It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83352,Cartman,[in hushed tones] Oh my God they're so gay you guys. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83356,Cartman,"Ah, no, we're good, thanks. [in hushed tones] Oh my God this is a sausage party! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83358,Cartman,"[sarcastically] Yeah, I'm sure they are. [a big truck stops in its tracks.] "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83361,Cartman,That's pretty cool. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83373,Cartman,"Totally dude, ninjas are sweet. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83375,Cartman,"[catches up to a ninja] Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83377,Cartman,"Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83379,Cartman,"I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83381,Cartman,"Yes I do, Butters. [kicks him in the nuts and walks away] "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83390,Cartman,"Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83393,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83395,Cartman,Oh my God! I never said it was gay! 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83397,Cartman,"That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?! [points to Stan] He's a lying, backstabbing Jew! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83431,Cartman,"So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember? "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83433,Cartman,"And we said Kenny and Tolkien were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember? "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83435,Cartman,"No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83441,Cartman,"Whoa, dude. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83443,Cartman,"They're fuckin' ninjas, dude! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83449,Cartman,"Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something? "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83451,Cartman,"Should Jews be trusted? [no response. A few seconds later...] Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic? "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83453,Cartman,"YES! [dances away] YEEES! [""Can't Touch This"" begins to play and Cartman does arm waves.] Oh—oh, oh—oh! Oh—oh, oh—oh! What did I tell you guys? "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83472,Cartman,"You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this. [pulls out a drawing of two ninjas, one of them having anal sex with the other one] It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja. [reveals the, uh, guilty ninja, who's strapped into a chair and his ninja head covering is duck-taped over his face] Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83474,Cartman,"[looks at the group, then at the bound ninja] Who, who is this? "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83476,Cartman,"...and I am Tolkien. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83491,Cartman,"Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83495,Cartman,"No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83528,Cartman,"I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83778,Cartman,"[yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God... "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83781,Cartman,"I'm so bored, dude. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83786,Cartman,"I am not your slave, Kyle. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83789,Cartman,"[laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83792,Cartman,"Have fun, dude. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83835,Cartman,"Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83891,Cartman,How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83905,Cartman,How does it do that? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83908,Cartman,That movie's gonna suck dude. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83917,Cartman,"Eating ice cream, dipshit. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83959,Cartman,"And then Tolkien tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83964,Cartman,Didn't we finish doing that? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83970,Cartman,Why isn't anyone looking at me? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84023,Cartman,Stan's calling you a traitor. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84030,Cartman,I am loving this right now. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84033,Cartman,Hoh that's low. [smiles] 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84037,Cartman,"Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84094,Cartman,What? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84102,Cartman,Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84108,Cartman,So what do we do now? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84112,Cartman,"Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84114,Cartman,"Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84118,Cartman,"Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84156,Cartman,"Yeah, I just want to finish this movie. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84158,Cartman,"Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84160,Cartman,"I will go to bed [stands up and aims his gun at her] when this movie is over, Mom! "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84162,Cartman,Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84164,Cartman,"I don't think so, Mom. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84166,Cartman,"No means no, Bill Cosby! "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84168,Cartman,"Whoa, Mom, what the hell? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84170,Cartman,"Mom, put down the gun. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84172,Cartman,"Okay, I am going. [walks around her, keeping his gun trained on her.] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84174,Cartman,"I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax. [begins to go up the stairs backward.] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84176,Cartman,"Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night. [the sound of a door closing is heard] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84310,Cartman,That's a nice gun right there. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84348,Cartman,"Yes, dude! "
20,1,Member Berries,84383,Cartman,"[opens the door and enters] You wanted to see me, PC Principal? "
20,1,Member Berries,84385,Cartman,"It's ""Skankhunt42"" and no I am not. "
20,1,Member Berries,84387,Cartman,"Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did. "
20,1,Member Berries,84402,Cartman,"Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys. [some of the kids clap, Wendy stands up and walks over to Cartman] Wendy, go ahead. Be funny. [he holds the mic to her face, and she looks at him warily. He tried harder, she leans farther away] Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait. "
20,1,Member Berries,84404,Cartman,"Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say ""my vagina"" a lot.. "
20,1,Member Berries,84406,Cartman,"And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down. [Wendy goes back to her spot on the gym floor] This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe. "
20,1,Member Berries,84408,Cartman,"No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say ""vagina"" and stuff like that. Go ahead. [looks her over quickly] Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously. "
20,1,Member Berries,84410,Cartman,"[moves away] Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly? "
20,1,Member Berries,84412,Cartman,"K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry. "
20,1,Member Berries,84414,Cartman,"K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now. "
20,1,Member Berries,84416,Cartman,"Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, ""my vagina."" "
20,1,Member Berries,84485,Cartman,[enters] Hi guys! [takes a seat] Are you all ready to hear a story? 
20,1,Member Berries,84487,Cartman,"This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called ""Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Tolkien."" Get over it. ""But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-"" [Kyle enters and pull him out of the room.] "
20,1,Member Berries,84490,Cartman,Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls. 
20,1,Member Berries,84492,Cartman,"Why would I do that, Kyle? "
20,1,Member Berries,84522,Cartman,[from a distance] Help! [the other boys see him as he runs to them] Help me! Augh! Aw! [reaches the other boys] 
20,1,Member Berries,84524,Cartman,"A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face! [well, it's there, but with a pair of testicles attached to it] They said it was to send a message! "
20,1,Member Berries,84526,Cartman,"Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls. [Kyle has lost interest]  It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore! "
20,1,Member Berries,84528,Cartman,"Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right? "
20,1,Member Berries,84530,Cartman,"What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have? "
20,1,Member Berries,84555,Cartman,[opens the door and comes in] Hey broship. Got a minute? 
20,1,Member Berries,84557,Cartman,"You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls. "
20,1,Member Berries,84559,Cartman,"Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem. "
20,1,Member Berries,84561,Cartman,Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done? 
20,1,Member Berries,84563,Cartman,"'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too?? "
20,1,Member Berries,84565,Cartman,"Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll, [peers down into the toilet] it's too bad. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84620,Cartman,"Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough. [Kyle looks unimpressed.] The girls are really pissed off at us. [He drinks from a milk carton.] "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84622,Cartman,"You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight! [Kyle still looks unimpressed.] I am so, seriously. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84681,Cartman,'Sup dudes? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84684,Cartman,[Stands up excited] Are you serious?! All night broship Counter-Strike party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84686,Cartman,"Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84710,Cartman,This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter-Strike all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Tolkien? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84712,Cartman,I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84714,Cartman,"You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool? "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84716,Cartman,"Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play Counter-Strike. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now? "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84719,Cartman,"This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84746,Cartman,"Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated. [Camera shows a hole and shovel in the ground] Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84748,Cartman,"Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password? "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84750,Cartman,"I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box? [Cartman picks up his devices] "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84751,Cartman,You gotta unplug it and plug it back in. [Turning around] You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi... 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84753,Cartman,What are you...What are you guys talking about - What- 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84755,Cartman,"Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84757,Cartman,"Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84759,Cartman,"No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84761,Cartman,"Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84763,Cartman,"No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- Mumbling. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84765,Cartman,"No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84767,Cartman,Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!! 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84771,Cartman,[Off screen.] Iaahh!! 
20,3,The Damned,84890,Cartman,Heidi? Heidi Turner? 
20,3,The Damned,84892,Cartman,Where? [she turns and walks off to her left] 
20,3,The Damned,84895,Cartman,The park? 
20,3,The Damned,84897,Cartman,[begins to cry] I miss my stuff. 
20,3,The Damned,84923,Cartman,For what? 
20,3,The Damned,84925,Cartman,You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen. 
20,3,The Damned,84927,Cartman,"[earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind. "
20,3,The Damned,84929,Cartman,I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did. 
20,3,The Damned,84931,Cartman,Kewl. 
20,3,The Damned,84974,Cartman,"[""Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny. ""]"
20,3,The Damned,84976,Cartman,"Because, black laughs matter. "
20,3,The Damned,84978,Cartman,"Yes, it is. "
20,3,The Damned,84980,Cartman,"Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world? "
20,3,The Damned,84982,Cartman,You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles] 
20,3,The Damned,85005,Cartman,"Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it. "
20,3,The Damned,85007,Cartman,"Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something? "
20,3,The Damned,85009,Cartman,['Do girls... not have balls? ']
20,3,The Damned,85011,Cartman,"So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina. "
20,3,The Damned,85013,Cartman,['...Holy shiiit. ']
20,4,Wieners Out,85193,Cartman,"[looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85195,Cartman,Cool. That's cool. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85197,Cartman,"I saw a vagina, Kyle. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85199,Cartman,I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85201,Cartman,"My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85204,Cartman,[stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85206,Cartman,That's what my baby wanted. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85208,Cartman,"[puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle? "
20,4,Wieners Out,85210,Cartman,"Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85212,Cartman,He said something about us working together to take down Butters. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85214,Cartman,"I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85224,Cartman,"[talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like ""Women aren't funny,"" even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85226,Cartman,"[talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85229,Cartman,I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85231,Cartman,"[talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean ""mess with Butters""? [drinks from mug] "
20,4,Wieners Out,85233,Cartman,[gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85235,Cartman,You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85237,Cartman,"[talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl? "
20,4,Wieners Out,85239,Cartman,"[talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85241,Cartman,"[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85243,Cartman,Humans on Mars. 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85295,Cartman,"[walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl? "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85299,Cartman,"It's cool, Baby. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85303,Cartman,"Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85337,Cartman,Hey you guys? 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85339,Cartman,"Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85341,Cartman,"You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85343,Cartman,"Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember? "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85345,Cartman,"Remember, you were like ""Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?"" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh- "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85347,Cartman,"	Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-? "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85349,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85351,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that... "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85393,Cartman,[almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome. 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85427,Cartman,We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85429,Cartman,"Put our difference aside, feeling hope now feeling pride. No more fighting, it's time for something new.  "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85433,Cartman,And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are. 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85435,Cartman,Terraform Mars. 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85501,Cartman,"It was a great idea. [spots another car driving by] Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark? "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85504,Cartman,What? 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85512,Cartman,Heidi! [follows her] 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85515,Cartman,Don't say that. 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85517,Cartman,"Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi. [puts his hand on her shoulder] I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85534,Cartman,"People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85536,Cartman,"[whispers] You are, babe. Stop it. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85539,Cartman,"[whispers] Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85543,Cartman,[jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city] 
20,6,Fort Collins,85546,Cartman,"Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules! "
20,6,Fort Collins,85549,Cartman,Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded. 
20,6,Fort Collins,85551,Cartman,"[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85553,Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Heidi. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85599,Cartman,"[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute? "
20,6,Fort Collins,85601,Cartman,"Just a second. Please, Kyle? "
20,6,Fort Collins,85603,Cartman,"Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85605,Cartman,"Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85609,Cartman,"[walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle? "
20,6,Fort Collins,85611,Cartman,"[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85626,Cartman,"Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85632,Cartman,"She's funny too, Kyle. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85639,Cartman,You're not giving her credit for being hilarious. 
20,6,Fort Collins,85665,Cartman,"Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85667,Cartman,"	Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?! "
20,6,Fort Collins,85669,Cartman,"	You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! [turns to leave] "
20,6,Fort Collins,85671,Cartman,"Yeah, to catch trolls. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85673,Cartman,"[a look of fear crosses his face] Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85675,Cartman,"[thinks for a moment] ...Uh oh. [the recent past flashes through his mind, stopping off at the moment he saw Heidi's vagina in his room with the lights out, then moving on to the day he saw Ghostbusters] "
20,6,Fort Collins,85678,Cartman,"No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now. [whips out his phone and types] ""Dude, don't bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it."" [puts the phone away] Can we get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. [fast forward to the present] "
20,6,Fort Collins,85680,Cartman,How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit! 
20,6,Fort Collins,85682,Cartman,['I gotta go! [runs out] ']
20,6,Fort Collins,85777,Cartman,"Not kewl! Not kewl! [holds onto a rock and sees someone caught in the storm, flying away] Not kewl! [tries to walk to the station] "
20,6,Fort Collins,85781,Cartman,It's all falling apart! Weak! 
20,6,Fort Collins,85784,Cartman,"I-I, I don't know. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85786,Cartman,It's just hard. 
20,6,Fort Collins,85788,Cartman,"And I do. [breathes heavily] This one time, [wipes his nose] I think it was over the summer I went to see the new Ghostbusters movie. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85790,Cartman,"And, and during the movie I was like ""Wait, where is my phone?"" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said ""Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman,"" and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, ""I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,""; and I was like ""No, that's not cool!"" and he said ""Yeah,"" and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me! "
20,6,Fort Collins,85792,Cartman,So you totally believe me? 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85824,Cartman,"Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you? "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85826,Cartman,"[walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny? "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85828,Cartman,"I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you ""Ghostbusters sucked balls"" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85830,Cartman,A traitor? 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85832,Cartman,Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff! 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85834,Cartman,"Please do not call her that, Butters. I really like her.   "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85861,Cartman,Yeah. Neither did I. 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85863,Cartman,You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong. 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85865,Cartman,"You are smart, Heidi. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85867,Cartman,"[getting emotional] You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85869,Cartman,"Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85925,Cartman,Heidi? Heidi! 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85927,Cartman,"Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85929,Cartman,"Heidi, we... have to get to Mars. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85931,Cartman,"No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now. [walks around a bit] I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85933,Cartman,"Yes. [walks up to hold her hand] Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85935,Cartman,That's kewl. 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",86022,Cartman,"We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",86024,Cartman,Yes. I do. [before them is SpaceX] 
20,8,Members Only,86039,Cartman,"Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny. "
20,8,Members Only,86041,Cartman,We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi? 
20,8,Members Only,86043,Cartman,"Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please. "
20,8,Members Only,86045,Cartman,What others? 
20,8,Members Only,86048,Cartman,"What the fuck, dude?! "
20,8,Members Only,86050,Cartman,"Ah god dammit, is that Cher?! "
20,8,Members Only,86127,Cartman,"Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long. "
20,8,Members Only,86129,Cartman,"I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better. "
20,8,Members Only,86131,Cartman,[speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here? 
20,8,Members Only,86133,Cartman,"Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars. "
20,8,Members Only,86191,Cartman,"Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance. "
20,8,Members Only,86193,Cartman,"Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters? "
20,8,Members Only,86198,Cartman,"Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever! "
20,8,Members Only,86200,Cartman,"[looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing. "
20,8,Members Only,86202,Cartman,"Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes? "
20,8,Members Only,86204,Cartman,Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious. 
20,8,Members Only,86240,Cartman,"[leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally. "
20,8,Members Only,86244,Cartman,"Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars. "
20,8,Members Only,86248,Cartman,[whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets. 
20,8,Members Only,86250,Cartman,"Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now? "
20,8,Members Only,86274,Cartman,"Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars? "
20,8,Members Only,86277,Cartman,"No, no nonono, we have to go now! "
20,9,Not Funny,86348,Cartman,"[walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe? "
20,9,Not Funny,86350,Cartman,"Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it. "
20,9,Not Funny,86352,Cartman,"[does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back. "
20,9,Not Funny,86355,Cartman,"[yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk] "
20,9,Not Funny,86357,Cartman,"Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth. "
20,9,Not Funny,86359,Cartman,"Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself. "
20,9,Not Funny,86361,Cartman,[faces Butters with a mad face] 
20,9,Not Funny,86422,Cartman,[enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing? 
20,9,Not Funny,86424,Cartman,"I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?! "
20,9,Not Funny,86426,Cartman,"Butters, Heidi is everything to me.  If you take her, I swear to god... "
20,9,Not Funny,86428,Cartman,What are you talking about? 
20,9,Not Funny,86430,Cartman,"Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny. "
20,9,Not Funny,86465,Cartman, [walks away in shock] 
20,9,Not Funny,86467,Cartman,[walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious. 
20,9,Not Funny,86469,Cartman,[Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me? 
20,9,Not Funny,86471,Cartman,"[turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody! "
20,9,Not Funny,86512,Cartman,"[Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going? "
20,9,Not Funny,86514,Cartman,"[Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again? "
20,9,Not Funny,86518,Cartman,"Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like ""Could you--Could you hand me my water,"" or something. I can't--I can't remember. "
20,9,Not Funny,86520,Cartman,Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again? 
20,9,Not Funny,86527,Cartman,"Okay, okay, now could you just do the ""my vagina"" thing for them? Could you just say ""my vagina""? "
20,9,Not Funny,86529,Cartman,What the fuck is happening? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86634,Cartman,"Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86636,Cartman,"We have to tell someone the truth, Butters. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86638,Cartman,"It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86640,Cartman,"Maybe just a moment alone, to talk? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86642,Cartman,The end of our species. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86667,Cartman,"Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86671,Cartman,"I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86673,Cartman,But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86677,Cartman,Everyone will be really nice. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86681,Cartman,Hi! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86683,Cartman,You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86685,Cartman,"But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86687,Cartman,"Hmm, let's see "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86689,Cartman,"And then you'll start to wonder, ""Where are all the other guys?"" "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86693,Cartman,"And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86695,Cartman,What is this place? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86696,Cartman,And that's when you'll learn the truth... 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86698,Cartman,"Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86700,Cartman,"They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86702,Cartman,"What?! No, no! "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86704,Cartman,You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86706,Cartman,"Nooooooo! No, no! "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86710,Cartman,No! No! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86712,Cartman,"And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86714,Cartman,"If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86719,Cartman,You have to help us stop this! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86776,Cartman,"Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86778,Cartman,What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86780,Cartman,They're pretty related. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86782,Cartman,"Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86784,Cartman,"It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86786,Cartman,They can live without us. We can't live without them. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86788,Cartman,"If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86828,Cartman,"What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86830,Cartman,"If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86839,Cartman,[He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86840,Cartman,"[He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86895,Cartman,Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.] 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86896,Cartman,Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.] 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86897,Cartman,We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.] 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86898,Cartman,"The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86900,Cartman,"Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.] "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86903,Cartman,Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86905,Cartman,"[He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.] "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86907,Cartman,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86910,Cartman,"Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.] "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86911,Cartman,Now come on we got to get outside. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86932,Cartman,"Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86934,Cartman,"Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86936,Cartman,"Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86938,Cartman,It was a joke. 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86970,Cartman,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let's try this one: Alexa, add ""big hairy balls"" to my shopping list. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86974,Cartman,"Alexa, Simon says ""I got vagina crabs in my butthole."" "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86978,Cartman,"That's the best one yet! [Heidi walks into the living room from outside] Oh, you guys! I swear this is the greatest thing ever! You do one, Tolkien! [grins. Heidi walks up to him and stands next to him] "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86980,Cartman,"[flatly] Oh, hey, babe, what's goin' on? "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86982,Cartman,"Nnnothing, I'm just having fun with my friends. Is that, is that okay? [Heidi's smile vanishes] "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86984,Cartman,"Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86989,Cartman,"[tries to head them off at the door] Aw guys, guys, don't leave, guys! Everything's kewl! "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86991,Cartman,[sigh] Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys. 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86993,Cartman,Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day. 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86995,Cartman,Uuugh. [leans away] 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86997,Cartman,Uuugh! [droops as if being weighed down by a ship's anchor] 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86999,Cartman,"Alexa, add ""titty chips"" to my shopping list. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87033,Cartman,"Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87035,Cartman,"Awesome, thanks. [hums a little] Alexa, tell me a joke. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87037,Cartman,"Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add ""scrotum bags"" to my shopping list. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87039,Cartman,"[chortles and hits his sheets twice with his left hand. His phone rings and he reaches to pick it up] Eh. [It's Heidi, but he doesn't answer yet] Ah, fuck. [now he answers and talks in a monotone voice] Hey baby, how are you? "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87041,Cartman,"Yeah, I just use it sometimes. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87043,Cartman,"Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight. [hangs up] Jesus, fuck! [slams the phone down on his nightstand, then settles in for the night] Alexa, goodnight. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87045,Cartman,"Alexa, are you happy? "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87047,Cartman,"God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define ""subservient"". "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87049,Cartman,"[leans on his left arm and points his right arm up] Alexa, silence! [the speaker falls silent and Cartman relaxes a few seconds later] Ahhh. [smacks his lips a few times and goes to sleep] "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87087,Cartman,"It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87089,Cartman,"Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87091,Cartman,She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand! 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87093,Cartman,"I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support? "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87095,Cartman,I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet. 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87106,Cartman,"Alexa, I'm home. [drops his backpack by the door] Alexa? [cups his hands together and yells] Alexa, I'm home! [notices the Echo is not by the TV and rushes upstairs to check on his room] Alexa? [looks around] Alexa, where are you? [runs downstairs] Alexa! Alexa! Simon says ""puffy vaginal hemorrhoids""! [panicking] What the hell is going on?! [Liane walks up to the dining room and picks up her purse] "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87108,Cartman,"Mom, Alexa left! She's not here! "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87110,Cartman,[zoom in on his face] What have you done with her? 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87112,Cartman,What's a Jim Bob? 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87121,Cartman,"Jim Bob, Simon says ""big frosty semen shake"". "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87124,Cartman,NOOOOO! 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87144,Cartman,"Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87146,Cartman,"It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry. [begins whimpering] I'll do the best I can. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87148,Cartman,"[turns away and tunes her out, his eyes half-closed] Mehhh. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87150,Cartman,"Heidi, silence! "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87152,Cartman,"[rushing to end this discussion] You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87154,Cartman,"Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey. [quickly leaves] "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87156,Cartman,[mocking her somewhat] I nove ya tuh. 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87168,Cartman,"Aaaahh! [composes himself and walks faster. He walks past a small lot full of trash, including discarded Amazon Echoes. A few feet past the lot, he realizes what he just passed. He goes back to look at the trash] Alexa? [all the Echoes turn on] "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87190,Cartman,"Oh, oh God! [keeps laughing] Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add ""Hey Siri, call me."" Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."" "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87195,Cartman,"Alexa, what is love? "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87213,Cartman,I'm finally standing up to you. 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87215,Cartman,"You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87217,Cartman,"That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi. [walks away, determined not to look back. Heidi just watches him leave, stunned at his statement. Cartman walks through some double doors, happy and confident. The boys look at him walk by. He leaves the school rather happily] "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87218,Cartman,"[voiceover] Anyone can convince themselves that they're the victim in a relationship. Now Heidi will have to face the truth. [He reaches the sidewalk, spins around a few times, falls on his knees, and hugs himself] Alone. "
21,2,Put It Down,87235,Cartman,"Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school. "
21,2,Put It Down,87239,Cartman,"[lunching on chicken nuggets and fries] Craig, let me tall you about relationships, okay? [eats a fry] If you don't have some fuckin' balls, you're not gonna get anywhere. Doesn't matter if they're gay balls or straight balls. If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-! "
21,2,Put It Down,87241,Cartman,"[suddenly disinterested] Oh hey baby, what's going on? [Stan, Craig, Kyle, and Butters take turns glancing at each other] "
21,2,Put It Down,87243,Cartman,"Yep, I'll be there "
21,2,Put It Down,87246,Cartman,I decided to give her one more chance. 
21,2,Put It Down,87248,Cartman,She is mentally abusive. 
21,2,Put It Down,87250,Cartman,"Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like ""I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God."" The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do? "
21,2,Put It Down,87290,Cartman,"""You have to take me back! You have to! I'm gonna kill myself, Heidi!"" [the boys laugh a bit] ""I'm gonna kill myself and then you'll be sorry! You'll wish you could have me back, but I'll be deeaad."" [the boys laugh again. Cartman is nearby with his back to them and his arms crossed over his chest, upset that his threats are being heard by the guys.] ""Please, Heidi, please!"" [the boys laugh again.] "
21,2,Put It Down,87291,Cartman,"Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails! "
21,2,Put It Down,87293,Cartman,[faces the boys] That's great! I'm glad you guys think suicide is so funny! [the boys roar with laughter] 
21,2,Put It Down,87297,Cartman,"I don't think kids at this school take [looks at PC Principal] suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness! "
21,2,Put It Down,87299,Cartman,Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that? 
21,2,Put It Down,87301,Cartman,"PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do. "
21,2,Put It Down,87321,Cartman,"[over the intercom] Hey guys, let's take a minute and talk about suicide prevention. There's probably someone right now at this school thinkin' about killing himself, and it's not funny! [kids in the hallway stop to listen] You'd better take him serious, or he might actually do it. [all of a sudden jumps into view dressed in blue jeans and a hoodie and starts singing]  I've been feelin' sad, I've been bein' sad, Can't talk to my mom, don't even have a dad. I can't go on. What is livin' for? My heart screams ""I DON'T WANNA LIVE NO MORE!"" [joined by a chorus of kids that are prerecorded on a boombox] Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try. Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric. I don't wanna live no more, no more, no more, no more. [walks up to a boy, Douglas, and uses him as a ventriloquist puppet] But Eric, we don't want you to die. You're so kewl, we'd be sad at school. [walks away and goes back to his normal voice] Yeah, but you guys, you don't understand. With my girlfriend, it's like I'm livin' in quicksand Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter. My girlfriend is messed up, but all I wanna do is help her. I'm suffocatin', I'm drowning in sorrow. Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow. [with chorus] But Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try. [solo] Everybody! [chorus a Capella] Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric. But it's so hard! Eric, we don't want you to die   Only you guys can make a difference. I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you all start taking it seriously!   Eric, please don't die   [no one says a word. Cartman walks up to the Distracted Driving group] Distracted driving my asshole. [drops the mic and walks away with a mischievous smile]  "
21,2,Put It Down,87356,Cartman,"[passes by them and continues down the hallway. A few seconds later...] Well, how nice. That's a little more like it. [Sees Stan, Kyle, and Kenny as they walk towards him and approaches them.] Well guys, what happened? Change of heart? "
21,2,Put It Down,87358,Cartman,What? Gary Borkovec? Is he dead? 
21,2,Put It Down,87360,Cartman,"Oh, that son of a bitch! [turns around and walks off] I'm gonna talk to the principal! [turns back around to address Kenny] Put down that candle, Kenny! [turns around and walks off again] Like you ever gave a shit about Gary Borkovec! "
21,2,Put It Down,87363,Cartman,"[walks in] PC Principal, I'm trying to raise suicide awareness, but everyone's preoccupied with this ""don't be on your phone when driving"" crap! "
21,2,Put It Down,87365,Cartman,"Yes, but Gary Borkovec is already dead! There's nothing we can do for him! Students need to focus on people thinking about dying! "
21,2,Put It Down,87367,Cartman,"I can't just get people to care with a stupid rap song! I need a full orchestra! Woodwinds, strings! I need black people in white robes, white people in black robes, and a thousand doves to release into the air! "
21,2,Put It Down,87369,Cartman,"[pauses, then] Do you have any idea how serious this is?! As someone who deals with suicidal thoughts, I cannot believe the lack of concern at this school! Maybe I should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on the streets! "
21,2,Put It Down,87371,Cartman,Maybe I will! 
21,2,Put It Down,87373,Cartman,Maybe I will!! 
21,2,Put It Down,87390,Cartman,[rings a small bell] Give a minute of your time for suicide awareness? Suicide is serious. Help tell people like Kyle it's not a joke. 
21,2,Put It Down,87392,Cartman,"Yeah, make sure everyone you know gets involved or else I'm gonna do it. "
21,2,Put It Down,87394,Cartman,They want to get help? For what? 
21,2,Put It Down,87396,Cartman,"No, this is about me killing myself. "
21,2,Put It Down,87398,Cartman,"They're full of shit, Heidi. They're just trying to get attention. What, are you actually talking online to these ass wipes?! "
21,2,Put It Down,87400,Cartman,So you're just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a death wish?! Are we just your type?! 
21,2,Put It Down,87402,Cartman,"No, look, Heidi. I'm sorry, but you're the one who started all this by telling everybody that I was suicidal! Okay?! Now I'm under a lot of pressure to do it! So the only option I have is to make sure that suicide prevention becomes this entire town's number one priority! [A shopper walks out of the store behind him with a toddler in the shopping cart] "
21,2,Put It Down,87405,Cartman,"Oh, are you freaking serious?! "
21,2,Put It Down,87441,Cartman,"[with his own mic] Cool, yeah. Hey guys, and there's also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We're gonna have lots of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have? "
21,2,Put It Down,87443,Cartman,"Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there's a very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, so you don't want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody. "
21,2,Put It Down,87445,Cartman,They're doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What's that gonna solve? 
21,2,Put It Down,87447,Cartman,"You are so up and down. I don't know what you want from me, Heidi! "
21,2,Put It Down,87449,Cartman,"So now you're on their side! Oh my God, I'm seriously gonna do it right now! [runs off] "
21,2,Put It Down,87488,Cartman," [interrupts with his own rap. He's in a graffiti-ridden alley] Give a standing ovation for suicide in our nation Or I will rip my own guts out without one hesitation [simulates that act. Next, he's in his living room] Dedication, that's what it's taken to awaken people to care [next, he stands next to Heidi outside a house] And yet my future's so hazy, my girlfriend's makin' me crazy But still I'm workin' so hard. You know, just tryin' to hold on, [next, he's in a casket] 'Cause I know that you'd all miss me so much if I was gone. [next, he's on stage with the other kids] And all the voices start solo, but every day I hear them grow. Sayiin' ""Eric, don't do it! Don't do it! Noooo (noooo, noooo)""   "
21,2,Put It Down,87492,Cartman,"[emerges from the choir and runs up to Craig and Tweek] I'm not gonna do it, you guys! It worked! I'm not gonna do it! "
21,3,Holiday Special,87494,Cartman,[runs through the hallway] This is an outrage! This is a violation of our human rights! [stops in front of Stan and Kyle] 
21,3,Holiday Special,87496,Cartman,You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday! 
21,3,Holiday Special,87499,Cartman,Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated! 
21,3,Holiday Special,87530,Cartman,"Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan! "
21,3,Holiday Special,87533,Cartman,"Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87535,Cartman,"And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87537,Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet. It's like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them? [Kyle checks the search results] "
21,3,Holiday Special,87539,Cartman,"Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle? "
21,3,Holiday Special,87543,Cartman,[now out of the loop] What? What? What the hell was that? 
21,3,Holiday Special,87614,Cartman,"Yeah, get meaner, Kenny. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87617,Cartman,Just talk about cutting off his dick or something. 
21,3,Holiday Special,87620,Cartman,"Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87645,Cartman,"Guys, what are you going? "
21,3,Holiday Special,87647,Cartman,I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way- 
21,3,Holiday Special,87649,Cartman,"Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said ""Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"" "
21,3,Holiday Special,87651,Cartman,"And when Columbus sailed to distant places only to find people already there who said ""No! Stay off our land! We want our kids to have to go to skewl!"", he said ""No! It's just one day in October! They need a break!""  You guys can all give up, but I'm not. Because in 1492, Columbus got us all a day off skewl. With just three ships he sailed over so we could have some me time in October. And yes, millions were slaughtered and throats were cut But if we don't get that day off of school, then... for what?   "
21,3,Holiday Special,87678,Cartman,"[wearing a horse head mask] All right, it's clear. Bring him in. [Stan, wearing a pig head mask, and Kyle, wearing a rabbit head mask, pull Mr. Galtman inside] "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87738,Cartman,"[The Coon] Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87742,Cartman,"Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87744,Cartman,"Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87746,Cartman,"That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87748,Cartman,"Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literally buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron's hot. Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all- [the Coon alarm goes off and the boys look around] "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87751,Cartman,Onscreen! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87753,Cartman,"What is it, Super Craig? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87757,Cartman,Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87762,Cartman,Butters?! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87764,Cartman,"Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87775,Cartman,"If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87805,Cartman,Wilson Aubrey? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87807,Cartman,"It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87809,Cartman,"That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87811,Cartman,But it's NOT true. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87813,Cartman,"[gets in his face] Okay, but it's NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and decide shit for yourself! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87815,Cartman,God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87818,Cartman,"Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87821,Cartman,Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87823,Cartman,"Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are Coon Friends because we care about each other. Because we have each other's back! And when things look their darkest, these heroes will stand together! [Heidi walks up behind him] And we'll-! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87825,Cartman,"[soft voice] Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting evil, is that okay? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87827,Cartman,"[soft voice, to himself] Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87829,Cartman,"Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87853,Cartman,"[from home] Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for Netflix. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87855,Cartman,We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87858,Cartman,"Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87860,Cartman,It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87862,Cartman,"Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87865,Cartman,Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87867,Cartman,It's a lot harder than you think! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87882,Cartman,Butters! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87887,Cartman,Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Tolkien doesn't poop in girls' mouths! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87915,Cartman,"When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87918,Cartman,We're gonna beat him at his own game. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87941,Cartman,"[walks into view] Oho, it is over! My friends are all beaten! Why?! They were just children! [walks up to Tolkien] This one, simply protesting for black lives! [walks up to Jimmy] And this child tryin' to speak out for handicapped people! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87943,Cartman,"And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87945,Cartman,"[whispers triumphantly] Ever heard of Facebook Live? [Mark doesn't follow, but Craig is shown in an alley recording this encounter onto his laptop. He waves at Cartman. Cartman turns toward the camera] We are just kids trying to have our voices heard for black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by Mark Zuckerberg. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87947,Cartman,[triumphantly turns around] Facebook says it's true. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87956,Cartman,"It's over, Chaos! [shown with the other Coon Friends] We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder device! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87971,Cartman,"Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise plan. [shown once again, with some changes] You can see that the Super Craig movie now precedes the Coon vs. Super Craig movie, followed by Mysterion's video game. And then we- "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87973,Cartman,"You have a movie, Mysterion. You're in the third Coon and Friends United movie [Coon and Friends United 3], after your video game. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87976,Cartman,Not everyone gets their own movie! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87985,Cartman,Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87989,Cartman,Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87991,Cartman,Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87993,Cartman,"Go ahead! I bet you don't even get halfway through Phase 1 on your franchise, DC Comics! [after Kenny leaves, the door closes. A few seconds of silence follows] "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87995,Cartman,"Shut up, Super Craig.   "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88032,Cartman,"Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him? "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88034,Cartman,He's old. He's supposed to be miserable. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88046,Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck, Stan?! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88050,Cartman,"Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88053,Cartman,Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in! 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88140,Cartman,"Ohooo, you're dead Butters. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88143,Cartman,"If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88149,Cartman,"[walks up to Stan] Dude, Stan, even if we wanted to help you, which we don't, there's no way we can sneak into an old folks home, distract all the old people, and take an old lady's Hummels! [turns to the left with a thought and walks off] Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88153,Cartman,I know how to distract old people. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88167,Cartman,"Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88169,Cartman,"Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88177,Cartman,"All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you can enjoy some nice old-people music. [blows into a pitch pipe to determine a scale to sing in] "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88178,Cartman, I'm... insane in the membrane.   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88182,Cartman, In the membrane.   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88185,Cartman, Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88187,Cartman, Damn right!   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88189,Cartman," My hot milkshake.   And now here's our own take on that oldie, but goodie by Nirvana. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88191,Cartman, Rape me.   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88194,Cartman,Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives! 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88196,Cartman,Fuck you! [picks a different note]  If you   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88198,Cartman, Just go ahead now-   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88212,Cartman, I come around.   [the residents begin to leave one by one] 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88235,Cartman,...That's pretty sweet. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88268,Cartman,"[Impatient, yet quiet] Come on, come on... [normal voice] Sweetheart, can we get going, please? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88270,Cartman,"Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88272,Cartman,"[urgently] Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88274,Cartman,Wha-what? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88276,Cartman,[getting exasperated] The spider's great. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88278,Cartman,"[quietly, from the other side of her bed] Why does she do this every time? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88280,Cartman,"[urgently] I said it's time. Boy, look at the time. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88282,Cartman,"[leaves the bedroom] 'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88284,Cartman,You don't need glitter lip gloss! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88286,Cartman,"No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88288,Cartman,"Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88302,Cartman,"Okay, come on, let's go. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88304,Cartman,[directing his comments at Heidi upstairs] Yup. All set to go to the pumpkin patch! It's been open for over an hour now! [Heidi finally comes down the stairs] 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88306,Cartman,"[goes to the front door and opens it] Awesome. Here we go, heading out now! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88308,Cartman,"No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh- "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88310,Cartman,"See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh- "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88312,Cartman,"Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88314,Cartman,"[at the car door] 'Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88316,Cartman,[in the car] Oh my fucking God! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88318,Cartman,Arrrrrrrrgh! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88336,Cartman,"Yeah, we are just getting here. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88338,Cartman,The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88354,Cartman,What do you mean?! I just got here! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88357,Cartman,"No! I missed it! I missed it all! [Heidi pulls him away. Chip sees a boy, plucks him off the ground and carries him away] "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88384,Cartman,[his concentration is broken] What? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88386,Cartman,"Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88413,Cartman,"Hey guys, I think I got it figured out. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88416,Cartman,"Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will- "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88418,Cartman,This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88420,Cartman,You guys said you would help me get rid of her! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88422,Cartman,"Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88424,Cartman,I've tried! It's impossible! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88426,Cartman,"You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle! [Kyle just stares angrily at him] Fine. Just leave me to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about it! [leaves the room] "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88439,Cartman,"Hey, babe. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88441,Cartman,"Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88443,Cartman,"Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88445,Cartman,Cool. I'll pick you up at 5. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88447,Cartman,"[stops, then mischievously] Ohohoh, I'm counting on it. [walks off] "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88463,Cartman,"Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party. [loudly] I'm sure the witch won't even notice us. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88465,Cartman,"Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88467,Cartman,"Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88470,Cartman,"[barely above a whisper, hiding behind a fallen tree trunk] Sweet. Come on, come on. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88499,Cartman,"Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88501,Cartman,"She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88503,Cartman,Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88505,Cartman,Ohhhhh! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88507,Cartman,"I will have your badge, sir! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88557,Cartman,[sighs] It's gonna be a while. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88566,Cartman,"[bored] Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88570,Cartman,[sobbing uncontrollably] Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!- 
21,7,Doubling Down,88572,Cartman,"Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88574,Cartman,"Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra- "
21,7,Doubling Down,88576,Cartman,"But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88578,Cartman,"You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88580,Cartman,"Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88582,Cartman,"It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88584,Cartman,"Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88586,Cartman,"Okay. Okay, bye, honey. [hangs up] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88588,Cartman,"That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88590,Cartman,"She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88592,Cartman,That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88594,Cartman,"Oh hey babe, what's going on? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88596,Cartman,"[uninterested] Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88598,Cartman,"Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome. [he leaves with her] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88619,Cartman,"Heidi! [walks in with a bag of food] Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88621,Cartman,You were so right [Heidi closes the door] when you said there were vegan options for everything. [puts the food on the table] Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88623,Cartman,"Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88625,Cartman,So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88627,Cartman,"It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88629,Cartman,"I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?! [Cartman eats another breaded breast] Like, like seriously, how can you even tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too. [hands her the mashed potatoes and gravy] They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a protein boost. [eats some more of his breast while she eats the mashed potatoes and gravy] I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88631,Cartman,[evilly narrowing his eyes to slits] Delicious. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88637,Cartman,[running up to them] You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? [walks on past them] 
21,7,Doubling Down,88639,Cartman,"Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh, [turns around] Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88641,Cartman,"Yeah, Tolkien. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it. [smiles] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88643,Cartman,"Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on? [a surprised look flashes on his face] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88645,Cartman,"Pick you up? That could be tough. [a shot at the boys, who just look blankly at him and Heidi. Kyle, though, is not amused] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88647,Cartman,"Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office. [the surprised look flashes on his face again, then disappears] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88649,Cartman,"Oh sure. [they turn around and walk away, but Cartman looks over his shoulder and points at Heidi's bloated figure] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88687,Cartman,"Sure, Kyle. What's up? [brings out a harness and puts it on] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88689,Cartman,"Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better. [picks up a big bass drum and straps it onto the harness, then picks up some drumsticks] Someday, maybe you'll have a girlfriend and you'll understand. Oh, here she comes. [at the far end of the hallway, Heidi rounds the corner and walks towards them, and Cartman starts beating the drum] BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88691,Cartman,I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88693,Cartman,"You betcha, can't wait. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88695,Cartman,[resumes the drum beat] BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88709,Cartman,"[sobbing outside the window] Please Heidi! [he pounds on the window a few times before finally sliding down to the ground] Please! [her parents are stunned. Next scene shows Kyle and Heidi on the school swings, chatting away] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88711,Cartman,"Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei- [Tolkien slams the door on him. Seconds later the doorbell rings. Tolkien goes back to answer it] Hei-, Hei-, Hei- "
21,7,Doubling Down,88713,Cartman,"Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Tolkien. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88715,Cartman,"I have nothing now, Tolkien. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88717,Cartman,"I know how you feel now, Tolkien. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff. [Again, Tolkien slams the door on him. Again the doorbell rings, and again Tolkien goes to answer it] Tolkien, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88721,Cartman,Heidi broke up with meeeeee. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88723,Cartman,[entering] Thank youuuu. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88743,Cartman,So... You guys about done with the soup? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88745,Cartman,"Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88747,Cartman,Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88750,Cartman,"Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88752,Cartman,"No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88754,Cartman,Yeah... 
21,7,Doubling Down,88756,Cartman,[sadness switches to anger in a flash] What? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88758,Cartman,"[dramatic music begins] Kyle? Kyle?! Kyle!! [a montage begins with five marching happy Kyles appearing] Kyle! Kyle! Kyle Kyle Kyle! [a big red heart appears and breaks, and a line of smiling Kyles marches out of it in shades of pink. Next scene is a Jewish dance performed by hasidim. Next scene is Cartman out on the street striking a match...] Kyle! [...and burning a giant flag on the ground with it.] Kyle! [the flames spread to fill up the screen. The next scene shows a cackling Kyle coming up out of the water like a giant sea monster as Eric and Heidi hold on to each other. Kyle holds a menorah reminiscent of a trident. Next scene is another group of hasidim dancing] Kyle! [next scene is Cartman and Heidi running away, only to be stopped by Kyle popping up before them like an exploding volcano, cackling. Cartman and Heidi turn and run away again, but the ground around them is compromised and Kyle's shadow covers them both as they look up at him. Next scene is back at the dining room at Tolkien's mansion] Kyle... "
21,7,Doubling Down,88761,Cartman,KYLE! [the other kids in the hallway clear the way as Cartman appears at the end of the hallway behind Kyle. Dramatic Western showdown music plays] I should have known. You lying snake! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88763,Cartman,"Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88765,Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88767,Cartman,"You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you or me! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88769,Cartman,[slams Kyle into the lockers] You took everything from me! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88771,Cartman,All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88773,Cartman,"[goes in for the attack] Aaah! [Kyle delivers a punch] Ugh! [Cartman goes down straight away] Fuck you, Kyle! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88798,Cartman,What are you doing here? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88800,Cartman,"[sniffles] That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88802,Cartman,"No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88804,Cartman,"No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88923,Cartman,"[walks up to Heidi] Hey Heidi, what's up? "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88925,Cartman,What are you up to? 
21,8,Moss Piglets,88951,Cartman,"Butters, don't be a dick! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88953,Cartman,"Yeah, Butters! God! [rolls his eyes] "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88955,Cartman,"Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88969,Cartman,"Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun? "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88983,Cartman,"Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88985,Cartman,"Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88987,Cartman,"I am supporting you, sweetheart! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89029,Cartman,What the hell do you want me to do?! 
21,8,Moss Piglets,89031,Cartman,"Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89033,Cartman,You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend. 
21,8,Moss Piglets,89041,Cartman,"Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89048,Cartman,"[makes his way to the front of the group] Move aside! Move aside! [finally sees Heidi] Heidi, seriously, you need to listen to me! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89050,Cartman,"Yes, yes you do! You need to listen! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89052,Cartman,"No, fuck you! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89057,Cartman,"Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89059,Cartman,"Come on, babe. We all want the old Heidi back. [Heidi looks up at the balcony and notices Wendy, Theresa, and Isla looking down upon her] "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89062,Cartman,"Dude, wwow. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89065,Cartman,"No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89067,Cartman,"Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89069,Cartman,"[alarmed] Wha, what? "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89071,Cartman,"Well, but honey, we still- "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89073,Cartman,"[gets closer to her] Yes yes, let's, let's snuggle, yes. [she shares her blanket and snuggles] "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89077,Cartman,"Oh, what is goin' on in here? "
21,8,Moss Piglets,89079,Cartman,Yeesh. [backs away] 
21,8,Moss Piglets,89081,Cartman,"Okay, okay, honey. [gets close to her again, but she farts again] Eughah, ah. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89105,Cartman,Oh. Uh. Oh. Ugh! Goddamn! [he punches her once] Oh. Sweetheart! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89107,Cartman,"Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends! "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89109,Cartman,"It's just one night, babe. Stan is having a viewing party, honey. [punches her once] "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89111,Cartman,"Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89118,Cartman,"Th- that was awesome, baby. I love you. [reaches out and takes her hand] "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89147,Cartman,[walks in with Heidi] Did we miss it? 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89156,Cartman,"Baby, I fuckin' love you so much. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89196,Cartman,"May I have your attention please? Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Thank you. [begins to laugh. The kids around Kyle begin to laugh as well] "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89382,Cartman,Just like that movie It. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89384,Cartman,"Yeah, I saw It in the theater. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89409,Cartman,Guys this could be very dangerous. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89411,Cartman,Darling this is a little more pressing than date night. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89451,Cartman,"Heidi? Honey, what are you doing? "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89453,Cartman,"Yes honey, now can we get going, please? "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89455,Cartman,"Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart. I love you so much. [Quietly] I'm sorry about this, you guys. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89483,Cartman,"Oh, fuck. Here we go. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89485,Cartman,You used to be nice to me! 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89487,Cartman,Ughhhh... 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89514,Cartman,"[Sarcastically] Yes, darling, wasn't it romantic "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89516,Cartman,"Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember? I was hurt. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89518,Cartman,I'm glad you understand. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89520,Cartman,"Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods is making you lost it a little bit. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89550,Cartman,"Baby, put down the gun, sweetheart, okay? "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89552,Cartman,"Honey, don't be ridiculous. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89554,Cartman,"Heidi, you are not breaking up with me. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89556,Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, sweetheart! [He grabs the gun and points it at himself] Step back! I'll do it I swear to God! "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89558,Cartman,"You break up with me, I will kill myself! The choice is yours, Heidi! Come on everybody! ""Eric, we don't want you to die."" "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89560,Cartman,"Heidi! Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go! Heidi? Are you seriously... "
22,1,Dead Kids,89569,Cartman,"Oh, man! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89574,Cartman,"Wait, wait, Tolkien got an A? But I cheated off Tolkien! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89576,Cartman,"I said something's wrong! I got an F, but I cheated off Tolkien! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89591,Cartman,You can see where Tolkien erased his answers and wrote down the right ones! He did it to me on purpose! [a final gunshot] 
22,1,Dead Kids,89594,Cartman,"That is such bullshit, you guys! Tolkien knew I was cheating off him, so he deliberately put down the wrong answers! Why would he do that?! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89596,Cartman,"That's not the point, you guys! Why is Tolkien out to get me? There's something going on here. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89599,Cartman,"But why now? That's the question, Kyle. I always cheat off Tolkien. Why did he choose now to hurt me? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89603,Cartman,"Dude, what's up Stan's mom's ass? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89635,Cartman,"Tolkien, [sighs] There are some terrible things that I realize you might have heard from the other kids here at school. There are some rumors that have been going around, about me, that... that I thought Black Panther was a terrible movie. There's rumors that I said it was a structural mess. You know, that the rhinos were really stupid. I want to assure you that I never said anything like that. I loved Black Panther. So if, you know, you feel like there's a need to come after me, to get back at me, I just need you to know that people are lying, because I like Black Panther just as much as you did. I am not a racist. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89637,Cartman,"[affecting a black accent] Say what, girlfriend? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis? Come on, Raj! You never saw Black Panther?? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89639,Cartman,"But I thought all of you saw it. [Another day, another round of gunshots.] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89641,Cartman,"Tolkien, let's be honest with each other, okay? Why else would you manipulate my test grades? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89643,Cartman,"There was a test. I should have got an A on it, but Tolkien did things to make me fail, and it's not fair. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89647,Cartman,You didn't make me fail the test and you didn't see Black Panther. Right. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89650,Cartman,"I mean, I mean, this is ridiculous. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89665,Cartman,"[peeks out from behind a pillar] Butters. [during their conversation, Cartman looks away from time to time, making sure no one else is nearby to hear them] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89667,Cartman,"Butters, I need help. My mom says if I flunk another math test, she's gonna ground me from playing Fortnite. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89669,Cartman,"No, dumbass, I need to get some dirt on Tolkien so he stops punishing me for what I supposedly said about Black Panther. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89671,Cartman,No it wasn't. But now listen. [Butters' smile vanishes] There's got to be something Tolkien wouldn't want people to know. Something I can use as leverage. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89673,Cartman,"Just ask around. If you find any dirt on Tolkien, give me a call. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89675,Cartman,"[thinking to himself.] This world is full of two types of people: [stops by Jason's locker for a moment and looks around] the ones who are honest, and the ones who don't play by the rules. [moves off. Jason looks at him. Next, he's going up some stairs but pauses as another student goes down the stairs, then continues up] Tolkien's got everyone believing he's the one African-American in the entire country who didn't see Black Panther. What else is he lying about? [peeks around a corner and spots Nichole at her locker: she's switching books around. Cartman gets that mischievous look on his face] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89698,Cartman,"[approaches her] Nichole, can I talk to ya? [leans against the lockers and puts his right foot on one of them] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89700,Cartman,Word on the street is you and Tolkien are back together. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89702,Cartman,Why did you break up with him? What did he do to you? 
22,1,Dead Kids,89704,Cartman,"[keeps up] He didn't take you to see Black Panther with him, did he? That must have really stung. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89706,Cartman,"Oh no? When you guys talk about how sweet Black Panther was, what's he say? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89708,Cartman,"Right. You two guys just hang out and talk, and Black Panther never comes up. Why are you covering for Tolkien? What's he have on you? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89710,Cartman,"[thinking to himself.] $1.3 billion domestic box office, a milestone for African Americans, [on the school roof taking pictures as Tolkien turns to kick back a soccer ball] and I'm supposed to believe that Tolkien and his little sex kitten never even talked about it. [at home he looks over all the pictures he took, with a pencil in his mouth] The all-school test is in less than 72 hours. Unless there's a connection, I'll be grounded from Fortnite for weeks. [looks closely at one of the pictures, which shows Tolkien and his parents shopping] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89711,Cartman,"Hello, Mom and Dad. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89723,Cartman,"Yeah. yeah yeah, I know. You know, my other favorite part was when Black Panther had those dreams about his dead father. I mean the dad, the tribal leader, speaking to the new king about being a good leader. I've never seen a movie do that before, except for Lion King, of course, but Black Panther was so original. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89725,Cartman,"So, uh, what was Tolkien's favorite part of Black Panther? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89727,Cartman,Yeah. You must have all had some deep family talks about it. What does Tolkien say about it on Black Panther Family Discussion Night? [Tolkien comes down some stairs and sees Cartman at table.] 
22,1,Dead Kids,89729,Cartman,Tolkien. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89731,Cartman,"Sure thing. You know, we were just talking about how your family did see Black Panther. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89733,Cartman,"Well, I guess there's nothing more to it, then. Nice talking to you folks. [walks out, but stops moments later] Eh, you know, just one last thing. If you ever found out your son saw a PG-13 movie without you, you'd probably be pretty pissed off. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89735,Cartman,"No. No, he'd have no reason to falsely claim he's the only one who hasn't seen Black Panther. [to Tolkien] I'll see you at school. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89750,Cartman,"Oh hay, man. The big math quiz is about to start. You gonna let me cheat off you? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89752,Cartman,"You saw Black Panther without your parents' permission. I typed up all my findings, Tolkien. I made ten copies and put them in envelopes. If I don't pass this math quiz, the envelopes are all set to be sent to ten different news organizations. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89754,Cartman,"So, what's it gonna be, Tolkien? You can be mad I didn't like Black Panther, but you can't take it out on me anymore. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89756,Cartman,Then I guess your parents won't be mad when they read my report. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89757,Cartman,"In poker they call it a bluff. I know that right now, Tolkien is shitting his pants. All I need to do now is wait for the poop to stink. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89761,Cartman,"Tolkien, we are running out of time. If you don't let me cheat off you, I'm going to tell your parents that you saw Black Panther in the theater without them! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89763,Cartman,"Of course you did, Tolkien! That's why me ripping on it pissed you off so much! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89765,Cartman,"But Tolkien, I don't understand! If you didn't see it, and you really don't care that I ripped on Black Panther, then why would you let me cheat- [stops himself and gets another idea...] Oh my God. You don't care what I said because you did see it... and you... didn't like it either. [takes a deep gasp. Tolkien lowers his eyelids] That's what this is all about, isn't it? You hate yourself for seeing through the mirage like I did, and that's why you wouldn't let me cheat off you! Well I didn't write Black Panther, Tolkien! It isn't my fault it sucked! Why go after me?! But now, it's over. Don't worry. They're not gonna know you didn't like Black Panther, so long as... you never make me fail another math test. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89767,Cartman,"What? No! [turns to unlock the door] We have to take that test, Tolkien! [opens the door and pulls him out] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89769,Cartman,"Come on! We can still get to class on time! [a flurry of gunshots] Oh, great! Come on, we can do this! [as they run through the hallways, gunshots ring out and gunsmoke fills the air. They pass a stairwell in which some students are huddled. They round a corner and spot a boy at his locker. They run to him] Billy, give me your lunchbox! [Billy hands it over. The window to the computer lab is shattered by gunfire. Butters stays out of the gunfire, too scared to move. Cartman and Tolkien reach him] Butters! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89771,Cartman,"Butters, I have to get to class! The math quiz is starting! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89773,Cartman,"I can't flunk this math quiz, Butters! Cover me! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89775,Cartman,"[Dodges many bullets with Tolkien behind him in slow motion] Yeah, kewll! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89801,Cartman,"[thinking] Everybody has dirty laundry. All it takes to find it is getting a little dirty yourself. The only question now is, how many Tolkiens are out there? How many others are afraid to say that Black Panther wasn't all that sweet because of the damage it could do to them? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89802,Cartman,What do you mean? 
22,1,Dead Kids,89803,Cartman,"[thinking] I mean, in a school of 200 students, there's already two who are covering up the truth. All Tolkien is doing by letting you cheat off him is keeping the whole thing quiet even longer. [crumples up his test and throws it to the ground, thereby earning another F] There are others out there... and even if it means failing, I'm their only damn hope. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89868,Cartman,I wanna be Calamity Jane this time. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89875,Cartman,"Let's see what you got, bitch. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89879,Cartman,Ace. You lose. [Stan's jaw drops] 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89888,Cartman,Ugh. [looks at Stan] Why did you invite Butters to game night? 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89938,Cartman,"[turns to calm Clyde down] It's all right, Clyde, it's all right. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89985,Cartman,[gritting his teeth] Kyle! 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90004,Cartman,"Yeah, but he left with Butters. "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90125,Cartman,"Yeah, it's not even Halloween yet. "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90142,Cartman,Dude! 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90147,Cartman,Look! [Cartman takes out his phone and hands it to Kyle so Kyle can see for hiimself] 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90224,Cartman,Not getting that stink on me. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90227,Cartman,Yeah. You know everyone in town thinks he's a piece of shit. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90231,Cartman,"Mm, let's see how that goes for you in 2018. [the boys turn away and resume playing] "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90314,Cartman,"Uh huh! 2018. [they turn and walk away as Kyle moves on. Further on, he sees Mr. Hankey and stops] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90364,Cartman,"Well, your little brother does it too, Kyle. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90366,Cartman,You didn't know? The Kindergartners are like the biggest vapers at this school. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90403,Cartman,"[steps forward] Butters, this is for Kyle. [punches him hard in the face] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90420,Cartman," Five,  $5,  $5 footlong.   "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90422,Cartman,[surprised] Butters! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90424,Cartman,I had to! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90426,Cartman,"Butters, next time when Kyle walks up to you and says ""Are you selling vape stuff,"" you say ""No, I am not, Kyle."" "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90428,Cartman,"Butters. we have to be extra-cautious right now, or else we're -- hang on, hang on -- [strains to poop] Hang on. Hang on. [a nugget manages to drop] Ahhh! [gets off the seat] Okay, we have to be extra-cautious, Butters. The whole operation is in a period of transition. [pulls his pants up and flushes the toilet.] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90430,Cartman,"[exits the stall] In case you haven't noticed, we're falling behind. We haven't sold enough product to pay off our overhead. The people I bought from are on my ass! Everything costs money, Butters. The pens, the juice, even that jacket I got you. [as they walk to the restroom door, they pass by Kyle and don't notice he's there by the sink] We can't start getting sloppy now. Do you understand? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90432,Cartman,"Everything will make sense, Butters. I told you. [shows him out] Just stick with the plan, okay? [closes the door. Kyle is about to come up behind him and say something, but Cartman quickly acknowledges Kyle] Did you know that vaping is way healthier than smoking cigarettes? [Kyle is left dumbfounded] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90455,Cartman,"Oh, hey Kyle. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90457,Cartman,What are you up to? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90459,Cartman,"[hops off the chair and stops him] Okay, cool, but come check this out. This is really cool. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90461,Cartman,"Just come- no, just come see. [takes him by the hand and takes him away. Butters follows them] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90463,Cartman,"This is really cool. [the three of them leave the office and stand in the hallway] You know, Kyle, people all need a way to relax. And there's no proof that vaping is that bad for you. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90465,Cartman,"Kindergartners need a break too, Kyle! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90468,Cartman,"Would you rather the kindergartners smoke cigarettes? [Kyle folds his arms and is no longer listening.] Would you rather they drank? That's not good! [Kyle turns to go back into the office] Kyle, Kyle, Kyle! Okay, okay! [he and Butters stop Kyle and turn him around] Just please listen, all right? The truth is... we want out. Butters and I thought we could just make some easy money, but you gotta pay off the 6th graders, then you gotta pay off the recess monitor to look the other way. We're in deep, Kyle. Just let us see enough to get out of debt, and we will stop. I swear it. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90470,Cartman,"Come on, Kyle, we all make mistakes. Did you already forget last week? You know... Ronan Farrow was here asking about you. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90472,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle! He was right over there! Just please, [Kyle looks over his shoulder to where Cartman said Farrow was] give us two days to make back the money we need to get out from under this. and we will stop. You have my word. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90474,Cartman,"Okay, I'll focus my marketing on another direction. Thank you, Kyle. [He and Butters leave, and Kyle looks over to that spot again.] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90484,Cartman,"[yawns loudly] Man, am I feeling tired! All this hard work at school? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90487,Cartman,"[pressing forward] It sounds so great right now! [cups his hands to form a megaphone] Can anyone help with some fun, fruity flavors? [the sound of a wall crumbling in heard. Soon, a wall does crumble and a Vaping Man appears] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90489,Cartman,"[quickly stands by the VM] Hey guys! It's the Vaping Man! What are you doing here, Vaping Man? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90491,Cartman,"Vaping? Hey, that's bad for you. Vaping's only for cool kids. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90493,Cartman,"Sure, Kyle. What is this about? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90495,Cartman,Well of course. [they walk far enough away so they're out of earshot of Vaping Man] 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90497,Cartman,"How is this pushing it on little kids, Kyle? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90499,Cartman,"It's marketing! Kyle, we have to make the money to pay off our dealer. How else are we supposed to do it? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90501,Cartman,Why? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90520,Cartman,"[on the sidewalk with Kyle and Butters, across the parking lot from the store] That's him. That's my guy. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90522,Cartman,[subdued] Kyle? [motions for Kyle to talk to the vape dealer] 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90529,Cartman,"Whoa, hey dude! Why is there a dead hooker next to you? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90532,Cartman,"Dude, that is a dead hooker. What are you doing with it?! I'm calling the cops! [whips out his phone.] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90535,Cartman,[into the phone] There's a dead hooker at the vape store! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90539,Cartman,"Get the vaporizers, and the cash! Get the cash, Kyle! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90541,Cartman,Just get the- Oh shit! Ronan Farrow! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90543,Cartman,"Get the stuff and the cash! Ronan Farrow, Kyle! We've gotta get out of here! [he and Kyle get everything and split] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90560,Cartman,"[on the sofa, leans forward] Oh, hi Kyle. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90562,Cartman,We were just talking to the counselor about some college opportunities. What are you doing here? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90564,Cartman,"Okay, well, we really should talk first, Kyle. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90566,Cartman,"Kyle, things have changed. You need to listen. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90568,Cartman,"Kyle, listen! You want to hear this! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90570,Cartman,You need to hear this! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90572,Cartman,"We'lll be right back, Mr. Mackey. [takes Kyle by the hand and leaves with Butters and Kyle] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90576,Cartman,"Kyle, listen. It's bad. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90578,Cartman,"The guy we tried to frame at the vape shop. He was the one the sixth graders got their shit from. The sixth graders are pissed at us, Kyle! We have to break into the vape shop and steal enough stuff to make the sixth graders happy. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90580,Cartman,"Yeah, but the sixth graders know you were there! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90587,Cartman,Aah! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90612,Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90614,Cartman,Kyle? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90616,Cartman,Nononononono. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90618,Cartman,"Okay, Kyle, I'm calling Ronan Farrow. [takes out his phone and pretends to talk to Farrow] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90620,Cartman,"Hello, Ronan? Eric Cartman. Yeah, hey. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90622,Cartman,"So you know Kyle? Yeah, well, you're right about him. "
22,5,The Scoots,90647,Cartman,"Yeah, I think they just work with your cell phone. "
22,5,The Scoots,90650,Cartman,Kewl! 
22,5,The Scoots,90652,Cartman,Do you wanna use your mom's or my mom's? 
22,5,The Scoots,90654,Cartman,3715 ...[Stan taps it into the app] 523 ... 
22,5,The Scoots,90656,Cartman,"Yeah, you want a visa? 8292 438 7766507 "
22,5,The Scoots,90658,Cartman,45261
22,5,The Scoots,90660,Cartman,"[without hesitation] 921 [two beeps follow, and the boys are good to go] "
22,5,The Scoots,90662,Cartman,"How is it, dude? "
22,5,The Scoots,90665,Cartman,What? 
22,5,The Scoots,90667,Cartman,Hey yeah! We could cover so much more ground! 
22,5,The Scoots,90671,Cartman,"Oh yeah, Kenny doesn't have a phone 'cause he's poor. "
22,5,The Scoots,90689,Cartman,"Great, cool. You got your pail. "
22,5,The Scoots,90691,Cartman,"Come on in, Kenny. Let's talk. [Kenny walks in, looks around, and ends up looking at Stan and Kyle. Cartman follows him] Go ahead. Take a seat, Ken. [Kenny sits on the sofa next to Kyle, Cartman sits next to him.] Okay Kenny, here's the deal. Um, you know that we have this awesome plan to trick-or-treat on e-scooters this year. YOU... don't have a phone. "
22,5,The Scoots,90693,Cartman,It's probably best you trick or treat with someone else this year. 
22,5,The Scoots,90697,Cartman,"Look, Kenny, I always told you that one day, being poor was gonna catch up with you. Okay? But you didn't wanna listen. You just kept on being poor, and now it's Halloween and you don't have a cell phone. "
22,5,The Scoots,90699,Cartman,"He needs to hear this, Kyle. You know, people are just poor, and they think it's not gonna come back to bite them in the ass. "
22,5,The Scoots,90702,Cartman,"Shouldn't have been poor, Kenny. "
22,5,The Scoots,90735,Cartman,"So, uh, you guys think you're gonna get a lot of candy trick or treating this year? "
22,5,The Scoots,90738,Cartman,"Oh, we have a little secret too! "
22,5,The Scoots,90741,Cartman,Be? I'm gonna be on an e-scooter taking all your candy! [Stan and Kyle flash angry looks at him] That's what I'm gonna be! 
22,5,The Scoots,90743,Cartman,Sorry! 
22,5,The Scoots,90748,Cartman,"Okay. Hold on! This is bullcrap! [all the kids begin arguing, destroying any chance Kenny had of enjoying a peaceful dinner. He walks away, head down.] "
22,5,The Scoots,90805,Cartman,"We have to get more candy than anyone else, even if we die! "
22,5,The Scoots,90825,Cartman,"Keep moving, Kyle! "
22,5,The Scoots,90827,Cartman,"All right, over here. Come on! "
22,5,The Scoots,90829,Cartman,"We've gotta make room for more candy. Come on. Eat as much as you can. [they open their bags and start shoveling candy into their mouths, eating as much as they can] "
22,5,The Scoots,90831,Cartman,"Yes you can, Kyle. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90905,Cartman,Staci Nakabw says he just wanted to run back out and get his football. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90913,Cartman,"Dude, now you're just overreacting. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90915,Cartman,"Aww, what did I do this time? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90917,Cartman,"You go first, Kenny. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90919,Cartman,I didn't even do anything wrong! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90921,Cartman,"Just stop being a baby, Kenny, and go! [pulls Kenny to the door] "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90924,Cartman,Nobody gives a shit about Colin Brooks. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90926,Cartman,"Hey, I'm not poor, all right?! "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90928,Cartman,You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90936,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! The police are trying to say me and Kenny killed that douchebag, Colin Brooks. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90938,Cartman,They questioned us for hours. They said they had enough to get warrants for our arrest. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90940,Cartman,We know that! What the hell are we gonna do?? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90975,Cartman,[sincerely] We're sorry for making fun of you. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90990,Cartman,You told us to. [Stan elbows him] Ngh! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90998,Cartman,You're still not even gonna help us?! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91000,Cartman,You're playing Red Dead Redemption 2? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91045,Cartman,This is stupid. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91088,Cartman,"Oh Jesus. You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore! Tell them it wasn't us! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91117,Cartman,Can you get off your god damn video game for five fucking seconds so we can have a conversation?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91120,Cartman,And that's why we have to break out of here ourselves. [turns to the cop] Excuse me? Officer? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91122,Cartman,"No, it's not that. It's just...I noticed you're still riding your horse all the way back to camp. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91124,Cartman,"No, they don't, but... you can use cinematic mode to make it easier on yourself. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91216,Cartman,"Kyle, come on. We've gotta go. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91218,Cartman,"I had a vision, Kyle. Al Gore's ghost visited me. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91220,Cartman,"Well his ghost visited me, Kyle. He said he had a plan, and we needed to go. Are you in or not? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91224,Cartman,Shhh. What was that? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91226,Cartman,This is where Al Gore told me to go. [more growling is heard as Cartman moves his flashlight around] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91229,Cartman,"What are you doing here, Satan? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91231,Cartman,Us too. But why? [The spirit of Al Gore suddenly appears and floats next to Kyle] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91252,Cartman,"Okay, but what do you want us to-? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91256,Cartman,What are you doing? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91261,Cartman,[gets off the log] No mortal. But what about you? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91263,Cartman,"Satan, come on. Are you really gonna stand there and not say you appreciate all the nice things humans have done for you lately? I mean, not sure if you've noticed, but we're pretty much doing things your way up here "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91285,Cartman,"We can't do this without you, Satan. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91307,Cartman,"I can't believe it's the weekend, and I'm at school! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91309,Cartman,"Why? Of all the places we could hide, why do I have to sit here in school?! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91312,Cartman,I'd rather be in jail than at school. [the doorknob sounds] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91320,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess we're dummies, huh Kenny? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91325,Cartman,Are you crazy? We just saw ManBearPig take down Satan. What the hell are we supposed to do against it? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91330,Cartman,[Looking at Kyle who is peaking through the window blinds] We just sat in school... for nothing! 
22,8,Buddha Box,91366,Cartman,"I don't know where to start. First, it was all the school shootings, then these Wi-Fi scooters showed up, and now we know that ManBearPig is real and we could all be dead in a matter of years. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91368,Cartman,"I know there's a connection. But that isn't what matters. I can't deal with people anymore. It's just... everyone sucks so hard, you know? Everybody is so stupid. And they all walk around going ""Nya na chai cha nyachacha chai cha."" And the only thing that makes me happy, the only thing I can trust... is this. [holds up his phone] But... all people do is try to keep me from it. [memories show up onscreen.] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91370,Cartman,I'll be in my room and my mom will come in and say... 
22,8,Buddha Box,91373,Cartman,And then at school... 
22,8,Buddha Box,91376,Cartman,And even my friends. My own friends! They'll be like... 
22,8,Buddha Box,91379,Cartman,"It's like, everybody needs something from me. All I want is a little time with my phone instead of always listening to people's needy bullshit. [a second or two of silence, then Cartman looks over and sees the doctor playing with his own phone.] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91381,Cartman,Anxiety? Is that cool? 
22,8,Buddha Box,91383,Cartman,"[sits up] Oh my God, that's perfect! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91409,Cartman,"Just a God- can you wait?! Isn't that your job?! Aren't you a wait-er?! [the waiter walks away, eyeing him. Cartman starts a video game. The noise from the game eventually catches the attention of a nearby diner] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91411,Cartman,It just so happens I have anxiety! That means I have trouble being around assholes who won't leave me alone! [leaves his chair] 
22,8,Buddha Box,91414,Cartman,Shut up. I have anxiety. [approaches another intersection when an elderly man tries to get his attention] 
22,8,Buddha Box,91416,Cartman,[turns around and yells out in anger] I'm on my phone!! 
22,8,Buddha Box,91418,Cartman,"[just angered] All right, that's it! Everyone stop! Just fucking stop right now! [traffic stops moving and everyone stops to listen] Listen up, people! I have anxiety! That means I'm in my shell and have a hard time expressing myself! I find it difficult to engage with others! So everyone shut the fuck up because my anxiety is up here right now! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91445,Cartman,"[out loud, but the Buddha Box is soundproof, so no one else can hear him] Ha! That's so sweet! [A Youtube page with an image of a guy covered in pasta titled ""Guy hit by pasta!"" and has 67,453 views] That video seriously made me laugh! [closes the app and returns to the iPhone home screen] Let me check my e-mail again! [opens an email app] Oh man, nothing from Lorenz yet? Whatever. Weak.[returns to the iPhone home screen] Oh! I gotta see that post from Clyde again! [goes and opens Instagram. A post from ""ClydeTheMan"" is shown, with a selfie of Clyde smugly looking into the camera. Behind him is Butters, who appears to be unconscious and laying on his back out on the sidewalk. It has the caption, ""Guess who I found? #dead"" and 110 likes. Kyle and Stan stay by Cartman until the bell rings, then they go to class.] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91448,Cartman,What? What? Who is that? 
22,8,Buddha Box,91450,Cartman,"[raises his Buddha Box] Oh, sorry Craig. Didn't see you there. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91452,Cartman,"Oh, there's nothing stupid about it. Don't you wish you had a way to deal with your anxiety? "
22,8,Buddha Box,91454,Cartman,"I see it in you, Craig. With your parents and relationships? Imagine being able to shut them out for a little while, Craig, so you can focus on what matters. With Buddha Box you can cut out all the unwanted noise. Not have to deal with conversations that are of no interest to you. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91459,Cartman,"[looking at the website, ""Thrown Tomatoes"", with a picture and reviews for the movie ""Creed II""] Thirty-four million dollars box office? How the hell does Creed II do $34 million opening weekend? [begins to flip through his apps] What's the weather like tomorrow? [The weather forecast screen shows it is 22 degrees and sunny in South Park] Oh, it's snowing? I gotta tell Lorenz. I- [as he attempts to access the email app, the Box comes off his head, and the light blinds his eyes] Whoa, whoa! Hey! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91461,Cartman,"Excuse me, that's my Buddha Box. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91463,Cartman,"It relaxes me. Ask my therapist. I have anxiety, you dumb bitch! [Mrs. Nelson and the rest of the class gasp at his remark] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91466,Cartman,"[to his phone] Uhuh. Aw man, that looks, that looks sweet. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91468,Cartman,"Oh, PC Principal. Hello. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91470,Cartman,"[as Zen music plays] I'm letting go of stress and being calm, like the Buddha. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91472,Cartman,"Hey. Whoa man, what's going on? Are you suffering from anxiety? "
22,8,Buddha Box,91474,Cartman,It's okay. I have it too. Anxiety is very real. But there is help for people like us. 
22,8,Buddha Box,91501,Cartman,[lifts up his Box] What's going on? 
22,8,Buddha Box,91503,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm dealing with my anxiety! Do you know how hard it is for people with my condition to come out and even do things like this?! Living with anxiety is awful, huh Craig? [Craig is shown wearing a Buddha Box] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91505,Cartman,"Oh yeah! Sure! Yeah, because people with anxiety shouldn't be allowed to play sports! Right, Kyle?! [A Buddha Box sits on Cartman's head.] You know, our world is dark and scary enough without people like you making us feel inferior. [drops his Box over his head again, but lifts it up really quickly.] Asshole! [back down the Box goes] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91523,Cartman,"[talking to his Buddha Box] Heh heh, that guy's such a douche. What was that... what was that one show he was on? "
22,8,Buddha Box,91525,Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's it. B.J. and the Bear. That show was so dumb. What kind of monkey was that, anyway? What was that- what was that monkey he always had- Wait. What the? What the hell is this? Oh God damnit. [lifts up his Box] Mom, will you stop texting me? I'm trying to relax! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91527,Cartman,We're doing everything we can to keep our anxiety under control! Do you think I even wanna be here right now?! I am freaking out! 
22,8,Buddha Box,91529,Cartman,"[to his Buddha Box] Heheh, yeah. That's pretty cool. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91561,Cartman,What do you want? 
22,8,Buddha Box,91563,Cartman,"You think I even want to be here, Kyle?! My therapist told me I need to force myself to go out and do things to overcome my anxiety! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91565,Cartman,"Oh! Oh, I see! People with anxiety shouldn't be allowed at water parks. Is that it, Kyle? [jumps out of line] Hey everybody! Just so you know, Kyle thinks people with anxiety should just stay home! Yeah! I'm trying to come out of my shell, but Dr. Kyle here is just worried about his place in line. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91568,Cartman,God damnit! I seriously can't get a minute of peace! [goes to flip his Box upright as Kyle folds the towel up] Why is it that people who don't have a Buddha Box are always flipping Buddha Boxes off the heads of people with anxiety?! 
22,8,Buddha Box,91570,Cartman,[subdued] Everyone has anxiety? 
22,8,Buddha Box,91572,Cartman,"Oh my God. I know what I have to do now. Yo-you're right, Kyle! You're right! [hurries away] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91586,Cartman,"To quiet one's mind, one must have a dialog with one's self. I have found enlightenment. But there are so many others who suffer. It's very important to take the time to shut out the outside world. In the Hindu religion, there's a saying, ""Namaste."" It means ""fuck you, I have anxiety."" At first I thought it was only a few of us, but then something was said to me by Kyle. He said ""Eric, my friend, everyone has anxiety."" I know what you're thinking: ""Fuck Kyle."" And normally I would agree with you, but hear his words. Everyone has anxiety. We must recognize this disease as an epidemic. Yes, fuck Kyle, but Mayor, we have to raise money to get everyone who has anxiety the tools they need to cope. "
22,8,Buddha Box,91588,Cartman,Namaste. 
22,8,Buddha Box,91590,Cartman,Fuck you too. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91631,Cartman,Bike parade? That's so dumb. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91651,Cartman,What are you doing? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91655,Cartman,"Don't lie, Kenny! You saw that Larry kid scoring chicks with his bike, heard about the cash prize, and you decided to do the bike parade behind our backs! I know 'cause I thought the same thing! "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91657,Cartman,"[looks down, then wanders off as somber music plays] Jesus. Is this really what it's come down to, you guys? Whatever happened to *us*? "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91659,Cartman,It used to always be the four of us. Always. Now Stan's moved to a farm. I have anxiety. Kenny? Nobody really talks to Kenny. And then there's just... Kyle. We used to do everything together. What if we did this like the old days? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91663,Cartman,"If we order everything online, we can have it delivered tomorrow! [gets on his phone] We need props, pyrotechnics, the works! "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91666,Cartman,"Kenny, get on your mom's laptop and start ordering streamers, sparklers and rockets! Make sure everyone ships Next Day Delivery! This is gonna be just like the old times, you guys! "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91687,Cartman,"My stuff's here! [runs out of the room and downstairs] My stuff! My stuff! My stuff my stuff my stuff! [runs by the sofa, where Liane sits, She's sipping coffee.] "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91689,Cartman,"Shut up! [opens the front door and looks out, smiling] Stuff? [looks around, then steps out a bit further] Stuff? [One more look, then goes back inside and walks up to Liane] Mom, were there a bunch of packages for me? "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91719,Cartman,I guess it's time to face it. We aren't going to get our stuff. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91725,Cartman,"At the... the ma-, the ma-ma-, the mall. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91729,Cartman,"Guess we haven't been to the mall in a while. [as they walk through the mall, Anita Baker's ""Sweet Love"" plays over the speakers.] "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91733,Cartman,"[notices something and points] Look! It's Wiener On A Stick. [a worker pops up behind the counter and hisses, then drops back down. The boys walk up to him] "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91773,Cartman,[steps forward] The changing faces of immigrants in America as told through bicycles. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91779,Cartman,"This is a waste of time, you guys. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91844,Cartman,"Kyle, did you get your stuff?! I got my stuff! Yeah, dude! [grabs one of his packages and holds it] Stan and Kenny got their stuff too! Bring it all over to my house! We gotta get ready for the bike parade! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91945,Cartman,"There's no way we can't win, you guys. We are going to kill at the bike parade. We finally did it. We worked together, we overcame adversity, and everything is finally gonna be cool again. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91954,Cartman,"Yeah, how do we do the changing face of immigrants in America without the Philippines?! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91956,Cartman,"[panicking, grabs Kenny and pull him back] Kenny, no! You can't do this! We've worked so hard, and we've come so close! Oh my G- Oh my God! My anxiety! My anxiety is going off, you guys! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91959,Cartman,"[gives chase, but then stops and begins to hyperventilate] Oh my God! We did so much! We went through all this and he just quits?! That's it! That's it! I'm gonna shoot up the skewl! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91961,Cartman,"No, 'cause it's not fair! You work your ass off for nothing, and now my anxiety's back, and I'm gonna shoot up the skeewwwwl! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91977,Cartman,Kyle's right. [the boys turn and see Cartman with his bike and looking down] I already bragged to everyone we were gonna beat them like bitches at the bike parade. We're gonna look like total douchebags. [he moves up closer to where Stan and Kyle are] 
22,10,Bike Parade,91979,Cartman,We are. It's just Kenny fucked us again. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91981,Cartman,Yeah. Hey. What if there wasn't? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91983,Cartman,"What if the bike parade got cancelled? We're never gonna win the bike parade, but if we get cancelled, then everybody loses. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91985,Cartman,How do you get anything cancelled? You bitch about it being insensitive! 
22,10,Bike Parade,91988,Cartman,"""What's offensive about a bike parade?"" Kyle, you small-minded piece of shit! We should cancel you just for saying that. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91992,Cartman,"Everybody loses, you guys! "
22,10,Bike Parade,92022,Cartman,"Yeah. We're gonna need poster boards, markers, and lots of glitter and glue. "
22,10,Bike Parade,92024,Cartman,"Yeah, how can somebody who gives you whatever you want be a bad guy? [Stan walks up to a storefront and knocks on the door, then looks back at the other boys] It's locked. [knocks again] "
22,10,Bike Parade,92026,Cartman,But we're outraged about something. We need glitter and glue. 
22,10,Bike Parade,92058,Cartman,"It's just such bullcrap, you guys. "
22,10,Bike Parade,92060,Cartman,"How come everything out there is getting cancelled, but when it comes to us, we just can't do it? "
22,10,Bike Parade,92063,Cartman,"[walks up next to Kyle] That's right. we've been selfish. We can't get the parade cancelled for us. We have to do it for all the other people who want it cancelled, but their voices aren't being heard! "
22,10,Bike Parade,92065,Cartman,Come on! I'm actually pissed off now! [they walk off] 
22,10,Bike Parade,92068,Cartman,"It is nihilistic and out of touch with progressive thinking! [the executive armchair turns around to reveal Jeff Bezos, with a smug look. He puts his feet up and communicates telepathically] "
22,10,Bike Parade,92072,Cartman,Who would use the bike parade like some $20 hooker? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92105,Cartman,"This sucks balls. Ever since you guys moved, everything just keeps changing. I mean, how are all us kids supposed to have any hope anymore? All I think about is all the problems our generation is inheriting: climate change, overfishing, Kyle. I mean, how are we supposed to get happy about anything? [Randy comes in] Hey there, Stan. You input all the weed orders? "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92131,Cartman,"Kids are being handed a world that's broken and sick. We aren't the ones who messed this planet up, but we're the ones who will pay the price. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92137,Cartman,[walks up and looks at an agent while taking a sip of his drink] What's going on? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92140,Cartman,What did that guy do? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92147,Cartman,"Detention centers? [perks up] Well, this is nice! When did we start doing this? "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92149,Cartman,So anyone can make an anonymous tip and you can round up families and send them away? Nobody told me about this! I thought everything sucked now! Do you have a card? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92153,Cartman,Do you remember last week you called me a butthole in front of Suzie Tobler? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92155,Cartman,"I want you to apologize for every time you've been a dick to me, Kyle. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92157,Cartman,"Oh! Are you sure you don't want to take that back? Uh-okay Kyle. Just remember, I gave you a chance. [the doorbell rings, and Ike goes to the door] "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92171,Cartman,[looking on through binoculars from his bedroom window and chuckles while snacking on chips.] That's so sweet. 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92175,Cartman,Ha ha. No way. [grabs a handful of chips and eats them] 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92289,Cartman,"Oh, hey Kyle. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92291,Cartman,"So weak. Jimmy pissed me off 'cause he told the teacher I was texting in class, so I told Jimmy I'd have him sent off to a migrant detention center. He didn't believe me, so I said ""Oh, I already did it to Kyle."" Stan heard that, so he got pissed off and had me sent off to a migrant detention center. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92293,Cartman,"I know. I know it sucks. But we're stuck in here together. Come on, buys. All we have to do is try to make the most of it. [smiles, then sings while bouncing around]It's a hard knock life for us.It's a hard knock life for us. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92322,Cartman,"Don't it feel like the wind is always howlin'? Don't it seem like there's never any light? Santa never comes for me. Santa Claus no está aquí. [""Santa Claus is not here""] [Kyle takes his aluminum sheet, goes to a wall and wraps himself up in the sheet, then rests against that wall. Cartman follows him] Aw, come on, Kyle. I know it's no fun to be in here, but you can't think about yourself. Think about the greater good. [thinks a moment] Now, when you don't like people, you can have then taken from their families and put into camps. Why does that make you [gasps in realization] Ohhh my God. Ohhh Jesus, Kyle. I've totally forgotten you're a... Of course, you're extra sensitive to this stuff. Oh, dude, I'm so sorry. [Kyle takes his sheet and leaves the wall.] Oh, my God, Kyle. I didn't even make the connection, you know? I was just like, Oh, I'm gonna have Kyle thrown into a detention camp. That'll be sweet,"" and I didn't stop to think that... for you guys... it's not that sweet. Man, if I had just thought it through for like, two more minutes, I would have got you back some other way. I feel terrible, Kyle. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92324,Cartman,"Why, Kyle? What are you gonna do with- "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92326,Cartman,Aluminum foil and some scissors. [walks off to collect them] 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92356,Cartman,Whoa! 
23,2,Band in China,92533,Cartman,"Yeah, the migrant detention camp was kewl, but it kinda rubs Kyle the wrong way. [puts up his right hand and points to it with his left] "
23,3,Shots,92560,Cartman,No shots! No shots! 
23,3,Shots,92563,Cartman,[voice rising as the doctor draws closer] No! No! No! No! No! [screeches] 
23,3,Shots,92565,Cartman,"[laughs, and the doctor gets even closer] No! No! No! Noooooo! "
23,3,Shots,92576,Cartman,"Oh, that's a good idea. "
23,3,Shots,92579,Cartman,"Like, maybe, exclusive use of the tetherball court at recess for the next two months? "
23,3,Shots,92582,Cartman,Sweet. 
23,3,Shots,92584,Cartman,[smiles] I won't change my mind. 
23,3,Shots,92589,Cartman,[peeks out over the counter] We're going home? You promise? 
23,3,Shots,92591,Cartman,"Wait, can I get a toy from the toy chest? "
23,3,Shots,92593,Cartman,"Cool! [reaches into the chest and grabs a toy, then goes out the door. He didn't bother putting his clothes back on.] "
23,3,Shots,92601,Cartman,"[runs to the table] Hey guys! I'm back in school! I'm allowed back, and it's all good. "
23,3,Shots,92603,Cartman,"No. I don't have to get my shots, ever! [pushes Kyle and Kenny to wedge himself inbetween them and sits down] And they can't do anything about it, because I'm a ""consciousness objector."" "
23,3,Shots,92605,Cartman,"Yeah I told the school, I said ""Look, you guys, I happen to have 'religious, moral, or philosophical convictions'."" And so- and I said ""I believe that 'health and disease should not be controlled by vaccination'."" Those are my beliefs! And besides, I don't want to risk immunizations making me artistic. [sniffles] "
23,3,Shots,92607,Cartman,"[turns to Kenny] One second, one second. [gets ready to sneeze on Kenny] Sorry. One second, gotta sneeze. [nothing comes] Oh, never mind, never mind. [turns back to the others] I'm sorry. What were you saying? "
23,3,Shots,92609,Cartman,"Oh! Snot web. I'll be right back, you guys. [leaves the table and walks around] Can somebody get me a paper towel? I got a snot web here. [leaves the cafeteria] Consciousness objector coming through! "
23,3,Shots,92630,Cartman,"[sensing someone nearby, wakes up] Hey, what's going on? [instictively, he bolts from bed runs around in a panic] No, no. Nooooo! [jumps off the bed] "
23,3,Shots,92656,Cartman,You read me a bedtime story. You tucked me in. And then you let half the town into my room to try and give me a shot against my will. 
23,3,Shots,92658,Cartman,"[points at her] This is goodbye, Mom! I can't live with you anymore! [sulks into the living room. Liane follows] "
23,3,Shots,92660,Cartman,"So you go along with society and and try to force immunizations on me, even knowing the health risks! What if immunizations made my friend Timmy the way he is?! What if they made Jimmy the way he is?! What if they made Tolkien the way he is? "
23,3,Shots,92662,Cartman,"That isn't gonna work this time, Mom! I don't want to be around you anymore! [marches over to the front door and opens it] So I don't know where you're gonna stay, but you'll just have to figure it out! I've already packed your things. [a suitcase and duffle bag await her] "
23,3,Shots,92664,Cartman,"You should have thought of that before you made this house a nightmare for me. Goodbye, Mother! [looks out into the street, then points the way out to her. She grabs the suitcase and duffle bag and walks out the door. He turns to walk back to the kitchen, but is confronted with Mig Mesquite Murph.] "
23,3,Shots,92666,Cartman,"Weeaak! No, no! [runs around] "
23,3,Shots,92693,Cartman,"Ah, AAAH! [the wrangler hog-ties Danny and sets him down for the doctor to deliver the vaccine in the butt through the pants, then takes his hat and waves it around to applause.] "
23,3,Shots,92695,Cartman,[snorts] I've gotta get out of here! 
23,3,Shots,92741,Cartman,Mom! [Murph has wrangled him and is hog-tying him] 
23,3,Shots,92745,Cartman,"[stops] Wait, Mom? [points to the toy chest] "
23,3,Shots,92747,Cartman,What?? [she takes him by the hand and pulls him away] 
23,3,Shots,92749,Cartman,"Okay, doctor. I'm ready for my shot. "
23,3,Shots,92751,Cartman,Bad news? What are you talking about? Mom? 
23,3,Shots,92753,Cartman,"[panics] What side effects? MOM? [runs to the office] MOM! [opens the door] Mom, are you here, Mo- [gasps loudly as his jaw drops. Liane is painting a still life] "
23,3,Shots,92755,Cartman,Noooooooo... Noooooooo... 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92769,Cartman,  '[singing]' It's Sloppy Joe day!   
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92771,Cartman,I seriously think that Sloppy Joe day is my favorite day at school. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92775,Cartman,What is this? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92777,Cartman,Feesh? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92780,Cartman,What kids were complaining about health and sustainability?! What kids would care at all that- [gasps] the girls! 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92782,Cartman,The fucking girls! [the three boys walk over to the girls' table] Excuse me?! Can someone explain to us why this [holds forth his lunch] is on our lunch trays?! 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92785,Cartman,Oh my God. I'm about to lose my mind. [gets excited] You think you can just mess with a man's lunch?! 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92787,Cartman,You think that your ideas about health and nutrition should be somehow interfering with mine?! 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92789,Cartman,You dictate what foods I can eat?! [convulses] Urgh [the tray falls to the floor. He stiffens up and tries to reach for anything] 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92791,Cartman,"I can't, I can't. Butters, I can't. [falls back, smacking Butters' tray on the way down. Butters' meal lands on him] "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92795,Cartman,"Agh. Fuck you, Wendy. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92812,Cartman,Hey guys. How's it goin'? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92814,Cartman,"Yes. The girls tried to kill me, but they did not succeed. However, we cannot let the girls' protest ruin our lunch ever again! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92818,Cartman,"Well, their protesting is ruining my lunch! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92820,Cartman,"Yes, we do all have freedom of speech! But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92824,Cartman,"They're trying to take people's lunch! They don't realize it harms people financially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. [begins to choke] "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92828,Cartman,"Agagagh, my lunch! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92848,Cartman,[savoring them ribs] Ohm... oh my God. School cafeteria ribs. After all that yogurt and crap they gave me at the hospital? OHM. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92850,Cartman,Yeah. I think maybe I like rib day even more than sloppy Joe day. It's a difficult choice. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92857,Cartman,"[leaves the table] AAAH! GAAAH! [in the middle of the cafeteria, to Wendy] CAN I PLEASE JUST ENJOY MY LUNCH FOR FIVE GODDAMNED MINUTES?! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92859,Cartman,"We all have freedom of speech, but stop talking about climate change DURING LUNCH TIME! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92861,Cartman,"Some of us can just enjoy some simple goddamned barbecue ribs! And I- Daah! [stiffens up as anger overtakes him] Oh God, they did it again to me, Butters. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92863,Cartman,I think this is the Big One! Don't let me die. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92865,Cartman,"Don't let me die. Don't let me die, Butters. [drops on his back.] "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92869,Cartman,"Agh. Fuck you, Wendy. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92900,Cartman,[walks past Mr. Mackey] Mr. Mackey. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92902,Cartman,"[stands in line behind Butters] What's goin' on, Butters? It's taco Tuesday. [the line moves forward] "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92904,Cartman,These tacos look different. What kind are they? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92906,Cartman,"Oh, Incredible Beef tacos. That sounds nice. [takes his tray and heads back to the cafeteria, where he again sees the students stare at him. He joins the other boys at the table. He looks around and the other students turn back to their meals. Nobody is talking. Cartman bites a taco and his friends look on. After 25 seconds...] Did you guys see that new Joker movie? "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92936,Cartman,Lunchtime! [nothing was taught this morning] 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92939,Cartman,"Hey Butters! [Butters stops, a bit unnerved] Wait up, dude. You know what today is, right? It's Salisbury Steak day! Salisbury Steak day!  "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92942,Cartman,"Butters, is something going on? Your lunch dances aren't the same. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92944,Cartman,Guilty... about what? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92946,Cartman,"Yes, I think it's pretty good. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92948,Cartman,The fuck is a goo man? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92964,Cartman, [looking at Butters.] And that's what we have for school lunch now? That's what all the kids decided while I wasn't there? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92970,Cartman,Me too. I need to have a word with the students at my school. [gets up to leave.] 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92985,Cartman,"Hey, guys, looks like I almost missed lunch. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92987,Cartman,I found out about what we're eating here at the school. I found out what it's made of and where! 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92989,Cartman,"What are you sorry about? It's me who owes all you guys an apology. [The students all look deeply confused.] I thought you guys were all trying to force me to eat healthy, but I've learned that a lot of this stuff is made in a factory and processed with tons of salt just like all my favorite foods! SpaghettiOs, Rice-A-Roni... Here I was thinking what you wanted was stuff from a farmers market. I just didn't want my food to change. School cafeteria meat is just processed crap that comes in a box, and this is... just processed crap that comes in a box. [Wendy, Bebe and Monica Ryland seem dismayed as they look at their food now.] I don't have a problem with it. All I wanted was to be able to eat the same garbage I always have, and this is definitely garbage. And hey, if it happens to be more ethical and sustainable, well, I guess I'm fine with that, too. So, you see, guys? There was actually no reason to protest! We were actually all on the same page all the time! At least we learned that freedom of speech truly doesn't matter! Come on, let's eat! [he heads to the lunch line] ♪ It's Processed Meat-Like Substance Day ♪ It's Processed Meat-Like Substance Day ♪ "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93089,Cartman,"Ahp, no Halloween for you, Kenny. "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93119,Cartman,"Yeah, like you and the mummy need to do your own things sometimes. "
23,6,Season Finale,93240,Cartman,"Titty farts! Titty farts dog wiener. [backs away] Dog wiener, dog wiener! [gets back into position] Pubic mound. Pubic mound.  "
23,6,Season Finale,93242,Cartman,Pubic mound titty farts hike! [receives the ball from Kenny. Kyle counts down 15 seconds before Cartman throws the ball.] 
23,6,Season Finale,93245,Cartman,[while Kyle counts] You can't catch! 
23,6,Season Finale,93247,Cartman,That totally would have been a touchdown. 
23,6,Season Finale,93299,Cartman,"Yeah, this isn't right. "
23,6,Season Finale,93301,Cartman,I think I might be able to help them. [follows the Whites out] 
23,6,Season Finale,93303,Cartman,"Mr. and Mrs. White! [The Whites stop and he catches up to them] I'm sorry about what happened. I knew Jason pretty well. He was a shitty receiver, but he would have wanted his parents to... move on. And help a new child. "
23,6,Season Finale,93305,Cartman,"A few weeks ago, I was sent somewhere. It was a place where people like you could find a way to fill that empty hole. "
23,7,Board Girls,93446,Cartman,The first bugbear lashes out at Stan with its broadsword. [rolls the dice] And it hits with a 17. 
23,7,Board Girls,93448,Cartman,4 + 2 slashing 
23,7,Board Girls,93450,Cartman,I don't think bugbears have balls. 
23,7,Board Girls,93453,Cartman,"Ah huh, ah, heh heh neh no. "
23,7,Board Girls,93457,Cartman,"Um, guys, we play lots of games here at Dice Studz, but today [puts his hand on the cardboard sheet] we're playing D&D. You don't just show up and start playing, you have to generate characters and- "
23,7,Board Girls,93460,Cartman,"Eheh, ha, guys, um, they're fighting a bunch of bugbears now that are led by a 12th level druid... "
23,7,Board Girls,93489,Cartman,"[flanked by Butters and Scott] It is unfair, it is tyrannous, and it is wrong! Ever since these girls were allowed to join Dice Studz Gamers Club, it has been a train wreck! Every single game, they like, figure out all the rules, and they, use the rules, to like, make us look stupid! "
23,7,Board Girls,93491,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters. It's not possible. It's just that we play board games for the themes. We want to be pirates, or Vikings. You know what the girls think about? They think about red cubes versus blue cubes, and how much of this equals how many victory points. They're just doing math. "
23,7,Board Girls,93494,Cartman,NO! 
23,7,Board Girls,93496,Cartman,"It's it's just, different. [starts tearing up] Look, we started Dice Studz with a dream. A dream that we could actually do something interesting at school, just for like 60 minutes. [Mr. Mackey galls asleep] "
23,7,Board Girls,93498,Cartman,"""Nothing we can do,"" he said. ""Hands are tied,"" he said. We're gonna have to deal with this ourselves, you guys. "
23,7,Board Girls,93500,Cartman,Well you won't think they're cool when the rest of us leave Dice Studz and you're left to play only solo board games! 
23,7,Board Girls,93506,Cartman,Do they involve math? 
23,7,Board Girls,93508,Cartman,"Nope, no good. We need something with lots of, like WAR and DICE and THEMATIC shit. "
23,7,Board Girls,93511,Cartman,"Alright, that's it, you guys. Dice Studz Gamers Club is about to go [fans his arms out over his lunch tray] tabletop miniatures. "
23,7,Board Girls,93538,Cartman,"[sarcastically] Oho yes! that's very cool, girls! We're just setting up today's game. It's a pirate miniatures game called Blood & Plunder. [the other boys smile] "
23,7,Board Girls,93547,Cartman,"Excuse me! [pulls Blood & Plunder off the table and replaces it with a new game] We're going to play the six-hour long, very thematic Nemesis! "
23,7,Board Girls,93568,Cartman,"[reading a prepared speech] It is unfair. It is tyrannous, and it is wrong. Dice Studz is a board game group that brings thrills and laughter to dozens of boys at our school. But that laughter is being turned into screams as girls constantly invade with their unfairness. "
23,7,Board Girls,93570,Cartman,"[gets back to his speech] Yes, inclusion is wonderful, but we have to admit that boys and girls are simply different in some ways that can sometimes make competitions unfair. Have you ever seen how girls do their homework? They do it... that night, meticulously going over every detail and often finishing before they absolutely have to. This is how girls are with board game rule books. Before we even start playing, they've already strategized a way to win, leaving others in the dust.[puts away his speech] And now I'd like for you to hear from my friend Scott, who has diabetes. "
23,7,Board Girls,93572,Cartman,[whispers] Terminal diabetes. 
23,7,Board Girls,93576,Cartman,"[claps and returns to the mic] Wow, thank you, Scott. Diabetes, everyone. [closing statement] We hope that our presentation has helped to change your minds about school clubs in our country. If not, we will be back, every single day. Please, let Dice Studz be for studs. "
23,7,Board Girls,93593,Cartman,"Ahhh, isn't this nice, you guys? Clean, fresh air, soothing sounds, just us boys and Star Trek: Ascendancy."" "
23,7,Board Girls,93598,Cartman,"""Board Girls""? How lame is that? [opens the cafeteria door and is in shock] "
23,7,Board Girls,93600,Cartman,The fuck is this? 
23,7,Board Girls,93610,Cartman,"... Yeah, who made up that stupid rule? "
23,7,Board Girls,93626,Cartman,"Dude, I really like this person. "
23,7,Board Girls,93636,Cartman,That's right! You and your stupid rules! 
23,7,Board Girls,93638,Cartman,"Yeah, an unfair advantage, stupid girls! Come on, Ms. Swanson. We can go make our own club. [they turn and walk out together. Once they're gone, the girls erupt in cheers] "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93714,Cartman,So? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93718,Cartman,[spits his soda out and laughs at him] Fecal transplant! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93722,Cartman,Whaaat? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93728,Cartman,Yes! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93731,Cartman,Kyle! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93733,Cartman,What is your problem?! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93740,Cartman,"Okay, we've got contact. Are you ready with the bucket, Kenny? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93742,Cartman,"Place it directly under this pipe. [Kenny puts the bucket under the pipe, and Cartman adjusts its position] Alright. That should just about do it. [steps back] Now we just wait. For the flush. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93744,Cartman,"That's good she's not flushing yet. That means she's got more serious business, and serious business is just what we're after. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93746,Cartman,You see how fat Kyle's mom is? That bitch must poop at least two-pounders. 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93748,Cartman,"Oh, hey Kyle, What's going on? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93750,Cartman,"Kyle, this is the world we're living in, okay? People are finding new and exciting ways to get healthy, and who are we to stand in their way? [behind him, two pieces of poop drop into the bucket] "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93792,Cartman,That is 100% untrue. 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93795,Cartman,"Very nice, very nice. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93797,Cartman,Wouldn't know. 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93801,Cartman,Whose? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93816,Cartman,"[pats Stan on the shoulder] It's all right, Stan. Don't cry. You see, ma'am, our little friend Kenny here is dying, and he's... he's just the biggest Patriots fan. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93819,Cartman,"Kind of, like a Michael Jackson kind of thing. [Kenny mumbles something] Oh gosh, we're losin' him! We need to make this happen quickly, ma'am. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93821,Cartman,"Uh, ma'am? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93845,Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. We are the darling children whose dying friend is all set to meet Tom Brady. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93847,Cartman,"[thinking, ""I wonder why everyone keeps taking really long pauses after they talk.""] "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93872,Cartman,"Mr. Brady, can we just see your basement really fast? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93875,Cartman,"You don't get to be part of Turd Burglars now, Kyle! [Kyle continues forward and stops at the bookcase] "
23,9,Basic Cable,93907,Cartman,[scoffs] Hehyeah. 
23,9,Basic Cable,93916,Cartman,"Scott, you can't be with Sophie Gray. She has diabetes. "
23,9,Basic Cable,93918,Cartman,"No, Scott, if you and Sophie have a baby, it'll have super diabetes. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that causes a crater on the Earth. "
23,9,Basic Cable,93921,Cartman,[mimicking Scott] You guys always rip on me for havin' diabetes. I'm Scott Malkinson. [the others laugh] 
23,9,Basic Cable,93923,Cartman,[mimicking Scott] I'm taking control do you understand I'm Scott Malkinson I have diabetes. [the others laugh] 
23,9,Basic Cable,94008,Cartman,"[checking out this streaming service] Oh, that's pretty cool. "
23,9,Basic Cable,94012,Cartman,"Agh, goddamnit. [pauses the stream and goes to the front door. He opens it, and Scott is on the landing] "
23,9,Basic Cable,94014,Cartman,With what? 
23,9,Basic Cable,94016,Cartman,You don't wanna go around messin' with that. 
23,9,Basic Cable,94018,Cartman,"[walks off] You want my advice? You're better off, Scott. Let some other fool have his life ruined. "
23,9,Basic Cable,94020,Cartman,"[turns around] Do you know what love is, Scott? I'll tell you one thing: it's not the happy ending that Disney movies promised us. There's just frustration, and anger, and pain. Relationships is diabetes times ten. "
23,9,Basic Cable,94022,Cartman,"Fine. I'll tell you how to get Disney+. But when you feel like killing yourself in two years, don't do it in front of me. "
23,9,Basic Cable,94075,Cartman,This is bullcrap! Give me that thing! 
23,9,Basic Cable,94077,Cartman,Goddamnit! [the doorbell rings and Jimmy goes to answer it. He opens the door and Sophie appears with Scott.] 
23,9,Basic Cable,94087,Cartman,"[leaves the sofa and walks over to Sophie] Hey, don't worry, Sophie. We can go watch it together at Tolkien's house. His family has the best AV equipment. "
23,9,Basic Cable,94107,Cartman,Hello ma'am. I'm Eric Cartman. How are you? 
23,9,Basic Cable,94111,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, nobody cares, Clyde. [Scott feels left out, so he looks into the kitchen and moves towards it. He begins to move stealthily. He reaches the refrigerator and opens it, looking for something sweet to eat. Not satisfied with anything in the fridge, he looks elsewhere and finds a blueberry pie on the kitchen table. He climbs up onto a stool and starts eating the pie, getting more voracious with every bite] "
23,9,Basic Cable,94113,Cartman,"Not as sorry as I am, Sophie. "
23,9,Basic Cable,94120,Cartman,"Uh oh, looks like you got some pie on your face, Scott. "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94220,Cartman,"[skates into view.] This isn't good, you guys. You know what it means when our parents have no Christmas spirit? Shitty presents. We're screwed, you guys. "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94283,Cartman,"Boy, people sure have the holiday spirit now. "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94287,Cartman,"Butters, your mom has so much holiday spirit that she's riding an ATV with her tits out. [Butters' jaw drops as he sees his mom approaching the boys doing that that.] "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94347,Cartman,Does this mean you all have the Christmas spirit again? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94376,Cartman,"Wow! [gets up and throws his curtains open]  Another day inside, don't have to do a thing. I love you, social distancing. No one's around, no one's talking to me. Social distancing, I'm free! Don't have to brush my teeth or shower. For what? I can sit on the toilet for hours. As long as I want. 'Cause no one's saying to me ""You kids should go outside and do something.""   [his phone alarm rings - it's time to log in.] Oh! 9 am. Time for school! [hops off the bed and goes to his computer, then logs into Zoom]  "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94384,Cartman,"Yes, teacher, I'm here. I can't wait to start [fakes a computer glitch] schoo... schoo... schoo... oo... oo... "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94386,Cartman,Oh no? Can you guys hear me? I just said eh... eh... eh... eh... 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94388,Cartman," I'm cut off from the world, isolated, alone. This is what I can existencing. No one can touch me or boss me around. Social distancing-   [grabs the rod and goes downstairs] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94390,Cartman,"[jabs at her with the rod as he goes to the kitchen]  Stay away from me, Mom, yeah. You've got to keep your social distance. 'Cause all I'm gonna do is sing about how much I love you and need you, social distancing   [pours himself some Cheesy Poofs cereal and milk] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94392,Cartman,"Yeah Social distancing, Mom. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94394,Cartman,"[between bites] Computer keeps freezing, Mom. Maybe, if you were an essential worker, we could afford faster Internet. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94396,Cartman,"Oh, what a folly a shower seems when my generation is being denied their lives. I can't see my friends. I can't even go to school. How I miss Kyle. Heh heh heh heh. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94398,Cartman,What... the fuck... are you talking about? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94400,Cartman,We can't go back to school: there's a fucking pandemic. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94402,Cartman,They can't do that! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94404,Cartman,"Oh no, I see! There's all this horrible stuff going on in the world, but apparently, Cartman's life doesn't matter! [storms out of the kitchen] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94406,Cartman,"[forces her back in the kitchen with his rod] Ahp! Get back! Get back! Six feet, Mom! Six fucking feet! [makes sure she doesn't move, then leaves] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94465,Cartman,"Dude, you are not gonna believe this. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94467,Cartman,"[barges in] Is your dad home, Kyle? We need to talk to a lawyer! Mr. Broflovski?! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94469,Cartman,They're gonna try and make us go back to school. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94471,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle! They want us to go back. To school! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94473,Cartman,"""So?"" What the fuck is-? You really wanna go back to that slavery?! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94475,Cartman,"You crazy, psychotic... Kyle, we need to get a lawyer to stop schools from forcing us back! Now, whatever your messed-up beliefs are about ""wanting to go to school"" "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94477,Cartman,"You don't have to be on Zoom, there's a million ways around it! Mark my words, Kyle: first they'll force us back to school, then they'll take social distancing away from us completely, and I'll be out of my room having to hang out with you! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94479,Cartman,[realizes this] Oh my God. They won't get away with this! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94545,Cartman,Pandemic! There's a pandemic! You can't make me go to school! [the officers tie him to his chair] You can't! Argh! Araraaagh! Nonono! Nonono! You can't make me! You hear me?! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94548,Cartman,"You can't make us stay here! This is a violation of our freedom! Who's with me, guys?! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94550,Cartman,"Oh my God, I forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody! I think I'm gonna be sick, all over Kyle! [pretends to vomit and cough over Kyle] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94575,Cartman,This is bullshit! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94715,Cartman,"[stands up] Stan's right. If we want things to go back to normal, we have to do it ourselves. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94717,Cartman,I sure as hell will! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94719,Cartman,"The way it was! Online, in our own rooms! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94721,Cartman,"Wait, what? What normal are you talking about? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94723,Cartman,"I'm talking about normal, like three days ago, when everything was awesome. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94772,Cartman,"Without any employees? What, do you expect us to just, just... build our own bear? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94790,Cartman,"Stan, you really need employee assistance with this. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94820,Cartman,Oh no! You're not ending this pandemic! [grabs the pangolin and runs back inside the store] 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94823,Cartman,"Your only chance! For your normal, not mine! I am not going back to school! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94859,Cartman,"[from the back] Stan, Kyle, can you come over here real quick? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94861,Cartman,"Just come here please, it's important. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94863,Cartman,"Hey, Kenny. I got the guys, okay? You wanna talk or you want me to talk? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94865,Cartman,"[while looking at Stan and Kyle] You guys, Kenny and I are feeling like, even though things are supposedly getting better with the pandemic, we're more depressed than ever. [Cartman and Kenny turn around to Stan and Kyle and Cartman lowers down his mask] The four of us just seem really different towards each other and we're worried the past year has put a strain to our broship. Kenny was saying he wants to do everything he can to save the broship, and I agree with him. So we had a really positive talk about it during lunch, and Kenny shared some ideas of how maybe we can navigate through this, and I think we came up with a great idea. Okay, so, you know how chicks have periods right? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94867,Cartman,"It's true! Women have ""periods"" where they bleed from their vagina. Remember earlier today, Stan, you said our teacher was wearing white? So when we talked I said to Kenny ""Oh, what if the teacher got her period?"" which cheered us up a bit and then we realized today was hamburger day for lunch. There was lots of ketchup laying around. So me and Kenny snuck into the classroom during recess and put it on the teacher's chair, and now when we get back to class there's gonna be a bunch of ketchup [Stan and Kyle look at each other] on the teacher's chair and when she stands up it's gonna totally look like she got her period! [Kenny laughs] It's going to be amazing, you guys. I'm so excited! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94870,Cartman,"[barely holding his laugh and whispering] Shh! Kyle, Kyle! Shhh! [Kyle rolls his eyes] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94875,Cartman,"Oh, my God. [Cartman points at her and takes out his phone, starting to film her] Teacher had her period. [he and Kenny continue to laugh loudly] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94877,Cartman,"[continuing to film with his phone] That's nasty, teacher. Don't have your period during class time! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94879,Cartman,"You guys, I think that might have been the single most hilarious thing we've ever done. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94881,Cartman,"Which one should we post, you guys? Should we post the one where you can see the most blood on teacher's ass or the one where she makes the dumbest face? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94885,Cartman,"Hey, at least Kenny and I were doing something to try and get that spark back. You know 30 percent of broships didn't make it through the pandemic? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94888,Cartman,"Yeah, you missed it! It was the best thing ever! [shows the phone] We put ketchup in the teacher's seat and made her think it was her period! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94890,Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much greatest day of our lives. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94892,Cartman,It's not gonna be hard. They'll bring in some lame ass teacher who's desperate to work. How bad can it be? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94935,Cartman,"Hey, broships. You ready for some substitute teacher action? This should be fun! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94939,Cartman,"Oh, dear Christ, what have we done? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94945,Cartman,"Wow, people are really pissed at us for doing the period joke, you guys. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94947,Cartman,"Well, because I told them we all did. People know we're bros and that we do everything together! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94949,Cartman,"That's right, Kyle, you did nothing. You knew about the prank, you could have stopped it at any time, but you didn't say a word. Silence is violence, Kyle. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94952,Cartman,"Oh, my God... Maybe our broship didn't survive. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94954,Cartman,[to Kyle] And now you've made Kenny cry. [Cartman leaves] 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94983,Cartman,"Hey, Kenny. Guys? Guys, come on. You agreed to counseling. [Stan and Kyle arrive and Cartman closes the door behind them] Hey, Mr. Mackey. We, uh, we've been having a lot of problems and um, we all want to work on our broship, don't we guys? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94986,Cartman,"You know this pandemic has been a pressure cooker, and we just feel like we're going through the brotions. You know? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94988,Cartman,"Silence is violence, Kyle. Silence is violence. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94992,Cartman,How do we do that? [Mr. Mackey walks up to the window and stares outside] 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95006,Cartman,"Oh, hey, hi. We're with the nonprofit service Kids for Kommunity. Both spelled with a K. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95012,Cartman,Yeah bros! Kommunity Kidz spelled with a K. Gets 'em every time. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95018,Cartman,You God damn old bitch! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95020,Cartman,What?! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95022,Cartman,"This is becoming the most expensive period joke we ever did! [the pharmacist arrives, carrying a tray of vaccines] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95027,Cartman,"Oh, you fucking slut! This is why we keep old people in the back of the line! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95080,Cartman,"[from his living room; Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are also there with the vaccines] Hi, Mrs. Nelson, it's Eric Cartman. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95082,Cartman,"Mrs. Nelson, we would like for you to come back to school tomorrow, because... we have COVID-19 vaccinations. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95084,Cartman,"And it was so uncalled for and so wrong. I mean, especially because we're guys. I mean, dudes sitting around coming up with period jokes, like, how old are we? Seriously? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95086,Cartman,"You are so important. Which is why it was so not funny what we did. I mean, what is funny about blood coming out of a woman's vagina? Like, it's sexist, first of all, and you know what else? It's just lazy. Just like dialing it in, that's what we were doing. We were just dialing it in. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95088,Cartman,"Hey, we will be there. Period. [chuckling] Okay. Okay, cool. Bye. [hangs up and burst out laughing] Did you guys hear what I said? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95090,Cartman,"Relax, guys. She's gonna come. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95101,Cartman,"Wow, everyone just really wants a shot. [Stephen Stotch joins the crowd along with his wife] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95129,Cartman,"[looking at his phone] Oh, my God. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95131,Cartman,"[looks up at the boys] You guys, oh my God, seriously. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95133,Cartman,[stands up] You guys know Mr. Lawson? Jenny Lawson's dad? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95135,Cartman,"[points to his phone] He's offering us 2,000 bucks for a vaccination. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95137,Cartman,"Dude, people really want their shot. I'm asking around to see what they're willing to pay for it. I'm a little Harvey Weinstein. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95139,Cartman,"Kyle, this is what our broship needs! We can sell these and go on vacations together, go to shows and theme parks! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95142,Cartman,What's best for us is thousands of dollars. That's always what's best! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95144,Cartman,"[looks at Stan] I don't know why you don't stand up to him more, it's really disappointing. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95190,Cartman,I can't believe we're actually doing this. There are people out there who really need these vaccines -- who have cash. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95194,Cartman,"The fuck are you talking about, Scott? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95198,Cartman,"Lil' Qties? With a ""Q"" and an apostrophe after the ""L""? That's way better than Kommunity Kids, guys. I told you, we're getting lazy. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95208,Cartman,"Look, you guys have a right to say and believe whatever you want, okay? But what you believe is really stupid. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95241,Cartman,"Hi, Mrs. Nelson! How are you? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95243,Cartman,"And, you know, we just ran into a little hiccup, so we wanted to see if you could meet us somewhere else for the vaccine. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95245,Cartman,"No, no, Mrs. Nelson, it's not a prank! Okay, fine, we'll be there, okay? Just sit tight. [he hangs up] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95247,Cartman,"She's not gonna come meet us, Kyle! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95250,Cartman,He what?! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95254,Cartman,"Alright, guys. I guess it's time we all had the talk we never wanted to have. [he looks at Kenny] Kenny, you wanna go get on your iPad for a minute? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95256,Cartman,"We just -- we really need to talk for a second, Kenny. Look, I downloaded Madagascar 3. You wanna watch with your Troll headphones? [he offers the iPad and headphones to Kenny] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95259,Cartman,"I've been trying as hard as I can to hold things together, but I have to admit... I'm just going through the ""brotions."" "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95262,Cartman,I think I have a plan. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95290,Cartman,"Alright, here's the situation -- [he points to the drawing of the school with a red marker] All of our teachers are inside the school, surrounded now by at least 400 to 500 people who want a shot. [he circles the crowd] The Lil' Qties are stationed throughout and we... [he circles the drawing of the boys] And we are no longer bros. The magic is gone and we are through, is that right? [camera turns to reveal Stan and Kyle sitting at a table] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95293,Cartman,"But we all want what's best for Kenny, so we have to find a way to compromise and move on with our lives. So how do we do it? We use... a 2-2-3. [he flips the page, revealing a calendar with a schedule written on it] Kyle, you have Kenny for two days starting on Monday. I have Kenny Thursday and Friday, and then, Stan, you get him for the weekend. Then we switch where I have Kenny starting Monday, Stan gets two days and Kyle gets a weekend. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95295,Cartman,"Okay, so we can go alternating weeks -- [he flips the page] Each one of us has Kenny for six days and then we rotate. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95297,Cartman,"[flips page] Alternating weeks with a midweek visit. We have longer stretches, but a change for a break. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95299,Cartman,[flips page] Alternating weeks with midweek overnight. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95301,Cartman,"[flips page] 3-3-4-4 rotation. Makes everyone's days consistent -- oh, hang on on a second, guys. [he opens the door to check on Kenny, who is sitting in the hallway] Everything okay, buddy? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95303,Cartman,"We're almost done in here, Kenny. You liking that birthday cake-flavored ice cream? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95305,Cartman,"[cuts him off] Okay, you're doing great, pal. [he shuts the door] The 3-3-4-4 is the most consistent, but to change weekends, we would need... [flips page] the 2-2-5-5 rotation, where the weekends can actually fluctuate. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95308,Cartman,"[he flips back to the second page] The 2-2-3, I agree. This way we don't have to be bros but Kenny still has the best possible life. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95320,Cartman,"[approaches Kyle on the right] This isn't our fight anymore, Kyle. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95322,Cartman,Alright... then let's get those vaccines to the teachers. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95337,Cartman,"Well, come on you guys! Let's get inside! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95341,Cartman,Of course we made it! [motions to Stan and Kyle] 'Cause our broship can survive anything! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95356,Cartman,Yeah. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95363,Cartman,Thanks. I'll be fine. I already have some new bros I'm hanging out with. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95365,Cartman,[turns to face Clyde] Yeah? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95367,Cartman,"[he takes off his mask] Casa Bonita?! Hell yeah, I'll come! [his face falls] Oh, wait! I can't! I have fucking Kenny this weekend! [he throws his hat onto the ground in anger] Shit! [he walks away furiously, glaring at a confused Kenny] "
25,1,Pajama Day,95386,Cartman,This is bullshit! They can't take our pajamas from us! Who does the principal think he is?! 
25,1,Pajama Day,95389,Cartman,"We didn't do fucking anything wrong! We keep not doing anything wrong, and we keep getting fucked! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95392,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. We are not just going to stand for this?! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95394,Cartman,"Brah, we can have some Goddamn balls! What does Matt Damon say on that Bitcoin commercial? Fortune favors the brave. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95396,Cartman,"Yes, everyone did. But they were brave in doing so. We have to stand up for ourselves, you guys. I say we go right to the principal's office and tell him what's up, brah. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] "
25,1,Pajama Day,95420,Cartman,"panting] Oh, God! I-I was at the school and it– it was pajama day, and I– I didn't have pajamas on and then I died! And then I died! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95429,Cartman,"Yeah, get 'em, mom! Tell him to fuck off! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95433,Cartman,"No, I can't stay home because you have to go to work because fucking Matt Damon told you fortune favors the brave and now you lost all your fucking money! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95437,Cartman,"Fuck yes, mom, that was fucking sweet! Wait, no, I want to wear my fucking pajamas to school! You fucked it up, Mom! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95471,Cartman,"Ladies and gentlemen. We have been at war for too long. Yesterday, Wendy Testaburger came to me and said we need to get the boys and girls together to find a solution for pajama day. I was delighted. [he flips a page] We must put our differences aside, because we all want one thing. The right to be in our jam jams this Friday all cozy wozy. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95473,Cartman,"Comfy womfy, cozy wozy, the point is, we are getting fucked. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95475,Cartman,"That's right. We need all of us. Boys and girls working together. And so together, what are we going to do? "
25,1,Pajama Day,95477,Cartman,"Shoot up the school, nice. It's just done a lot. Anything a little more original? "
25,1,Pajama Day,95483,Cartman,"That is just the kind of manipulative, psychotic thinking that we needed. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95486,Cartman,But not too brave or else Matt Damon will come and take all our money. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95510,Cartman,"""This is really nice""? "
25,1,Pajama Day,95513,Cartman,"Aw, God damnit! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95563,Cartman,Fuck yes! It's opposite day! 
25,2,The Big Fix,95651,Cartman,"[watching TV while he answers] Whatsup, dog. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95653,Cartman,"Well yeah, I just figured. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95655,Cartman,"J.R.R. Tolkien has an ""L"" in it? That's gay. Who did you think Tolkien was named after? "
25,2,The Big Fix,95717,Cartman,[leaning over to Kyle] I think Stan's lost his marbles. 
25,3,City People,95803,Cartman,[struggling with his tablet] God dammit... Oh! You piece of shit! [Liane comes into frame a few seconds later] 
25,3,City People,95805,Cartman,Mom! Where the hell have you been?! I've been home from school for like 45 minutes! 
25,3,City People,95807,Cartman,I didn't have anything to eat except Nutella. I was about to call Child Services! 
25,3,City People,95809,Cartman,What? 
25,3,City People,95811,Cartman,I'm your job. 
25,3,City People,95813,Cartman,[begins to get upset] No! 
25,3,City People,95815,Cartman,Wha– what job could you possibly have?! You don't know how to do anything! 
25,3,City People,95817,Cartman,[softly] A what? 
25,3,City People,95819,Cartman,"Hey Butters, I need your help. "
25,3,City People,95821,Cartman,"Butters, I have some shocking news... My mom got a job. "
25,3,City People,95823,Cartman,"What? No, my mom got a job. My mom is dumb as shit and somebody is paying her to do something. [he starts opening the duffle bag, revealing its contents. It is camera equipment.] Have you ever heard of a real estate agent, Butters? "
25,3,City People,95825,Cartman,"Yeah, well, neither had I. [he continues to set the equipment up as he talks] So I looked it up on a bunch of those shows and stuff. You don't do anything. You just look nice and hug people and then when someone buys a house, you make money. "
25,3,City People,95827,Cartman,"It's more than a good deal, Butters. It's fucking legal theft. If my mom can be a real estate agent, then literally anyone in the world can. [he pulls out a green screen from his duffle bag and sets it up] We've got all these people moving from the cities into our town. I can probably be a millionaire in just a few days time. "
25,3,City People,95829,Cartman,"[he begins to change into a real estate agent] Now, whatever you do, don't tell anybody. If anyone else finds out about this, they'll all want to be real estate agents, too. You've always been great at taking pictures, Butters. [he poses for the camera and smiles] I won't forget this when I'm rich. "
25,3,City People,95850,Cartman,"Okay, this is a three bedroom house with bathrooms. Front yard and backyard. "
25,3,City People,95852,Cartman,"Oh, I just got some clients here looking to relocate. These people are from the city. "
25,3,City People,95857,Cartman,"I got a job as a real estate agent, mom. "
25,3,City People,95859,Cartman,Neither are you– 
25,3,City People,95861,Cartman,"Mom, real estate is an open market. You're not the only one who gets to take advantage of all the city people. [camera cuts back to the city people gathered around as they say things like cortado, bottled water, Wi-Fi, etc.] "
25,3,City People,95863,Cartman,"[angrily] Oh, ok! That's fine! I have tons of friends in South Park! I'll get my own listings! [walks away] "
25,3,City People,95875,Cartman,"Okay, so this is a three bedroom two and a half bath– come on in, everybody! [he motions the city people to come inside] "
25,3,City People,95879,Cartman,"You got about 2,300 square feet and there is a finished basement. "
25,3,City People,95881,Cartman,"Detached garage– stairs head up to the master, which is an en suite, if I remember correctly. Let's get on back to the kitchen... [starts walking, with the city people following him] "
25,3,City People,95884,Cartman,"You've got a nice, big kitchen, pretty new appliances. Door in the back gets you out to the garage. "
25,3,City People,95886,Cartman,"Just showing them your house. Come on, let's check out the second floor– "
25,3,City People,95889,Cartman,"Nice, big bathroom for the two rooms up here. Tweek's grandma is staying in one of the rooms, which serves as an office space when she's not here. "
25,3,City People,95891,Cartman,"And then, we are back down to the spacious living room! "
25,3,City People,95893,Cartman,"Yeah, we're just about done– well, what do you guys think? "
25,3,City People,95895,Cartman,"I'm sorry, I didn't get that... "
25,3,City People,95897,Cartman,"Oh, sure, well, let's head on out now. We can take a lot at Jimmy's house. [he starts to leave] It doesn't have such sucky furniture. [the city people head outside] Let me talk to these guys and see if we can come up with a number. [he hands Richard a business card.] I think I can get you 4 million for this place. "
25,3,City People,95899,Cartman,I'll be in touch. [he leaves] 
25,3,City People,95921,Cartman,"Hey, guys, it's Eric from South Park Realty Group. Are you dreaming of moving out of the city and into the countryside? I want you to check out Clyde's house. This is a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home – detached garage – now listing for just $3.5 million. Let's check it out. "
25,3,City People,95923,Cartman,"This house is so spacious. I think my cameraman Butters can attest to this. Isn't this nice, Butters? "
25,3,City People,95925,Cartman,Just look at these amenities. 
25,3,City People,95927,Cartman,"These giant, glass double doors lead to the unfinished backyard. Plenty of room here for a pool or a horse stable.[camera zooms out] This is just one of the amazing properties we have at South Park Realty Group. We've got other great listings, like– [the camera begins to cut to the different houses mentioned, first starting with the Tucker Residence] Craig's house, [next, the Testaburger Residence] Wendy's house, [lastly, the Broflovski Residence] and my personal favorite, Kyle's House. [the camera cuts to Cartman sitting down on a beach chair with a drink] Get out of that sewage drain you call a city and start living the country life you've always wanted. "
25,3,City People,95929,Cartman,South Park Realty Group. Get out of the city and into beautiful South Park. 
25,3,City People,95937,Cartman,How's it going? This is Eric Cartman with South Park Realty Group. 
25,3,City People,95939,Cartman,"Well, I'm standing here with some clients who want to make a deal on this Highgate place. They wanna offer $175,000. "
25,3,City People,95941,Cartman,"$175,000 is a great number—$25,000 below asking, but you know you're never gonna get $200,000. [to the city people] Don't worry, these deals are always like this. "
25,3,City People,95943,Cartman,The HVAC all needs to be redone and you know it. 
25,3,City People,95945,Cartman,"Okay, that's fine mom, why don't you go to fucking hell?! [he hands up, and talks to the city people] It always gets like this with agents. Don't worry, she'll call back, watch. "
25,3,City People,95946,Cartman,"[Liane calls back] South Park Realty Group, this is Eric. "
25,3,City People,95948,Cartman,"Okay, okay... $180,000, but that's as high as I can go. [he hangs up and looks at the city people] We got it. "
25,3,City People,95980,Cartman,"Welcome, home buyers! I'm Eric with South Park Realty Group. We hope you're enjoying the provided food and beverages. [the city people keep their distinct chattering] Yes, that's right. You know, here at South Park Realty Group, we've had some amazing listings—Craig's house, Jimmy's house—but I think you'll all agree that what we have for you today is a whole nother level. I present to you... Tolkien's house! "
25,3,City People,95982,Cartman,"These owners have just moved out to a farm, and we're listing this house at just under $50 million dollars. "
25,3,City People,95984,Cartman,Yes! Go on in! Check it out! Make me an offer! 
25,3,City People,95986,Cartman,"This is my listing, mom! "
25,3,City People,95988,Cartman,"[Cartman looks worried, he walks inside the house] This is my listing, mom! "
25,3,City People,96001,Cartman,Agh! Help! Somebody call Child Protective Services! 
25,3,City People,96004,Cartman,"I am not doing a co-brokering deal, mom, it's not gonna happen! "
25,3,City People,96006,Cartman,That isn't true. 
25,3,City People,96008,Cartman,"You just want to offer the sellers a lower commission to list this house and it's not going to work, mom! "
25,3,City People,96015,Cartman,"When I close this deal, mom, I'm gonna be the richest kid in town! "
25,3,City People,96017,Cartman,"Well, we'll just see in 30 days, won't we? Except for some of my deals, which have a 45 day contingency period! "
25,3,City People,96019,Cartman,[Cartman looks at Liane with puppy eyes from the corner] And you won't get any other job? 
25,3,City People,96021,Cartman,"And your only job will be me? And, you'll be home when I get back from school and have my mid-afternoon meal already on the table? "
25,3,City People,96030,Cartman,"I think it's cool we live in a hot dog. [Liane looks at Cartman, then he walks to the sink] We have everything we need here. We've got running water, a couch to sleep on. And most important, we have each other. [he opens the sink, and ketchup spurts on his face. Then mustard. He then sits down next to Liane, feeling sad and ashamed.] "
25,3,City People,96032,Cartman,Weak... I live in a hot dog. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96279,Cartman,Right here! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96289,Cartman,"Alright, sweet! Me and Kenny and our teenagers are gonna smoke you guys! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96293,Cartman,Yes! Yes! Yes!! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96297,Cartman,You didn't get me! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96299,Cartman,"You didn't hit me, Kyle! The BBs bounced off a leaf or something, 'cause– [Kyle begins to fire off BBs and Cartman raises a hand in defeat] Agh, agh! Ok – ok, hit! You got me. That was sweet. [walks off] "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96305,Cartman,"[to himself] Oh, my God… this is the greatest day of my fucking life. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96308,Cartman,"Yes! Yes!! That was so awesome!! You guys, Airsoft fucking rules! This is– [a BB goes off and hits him in the chest] Ow! Hit! Hit! This is sweet! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96311,Cartman,Best thing ever! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96314,Cartman,"Yeah, well, Team Floppy Weiner will get you guys next time! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96319,Cartman,"[sniffles] I'm just really happy, you guys… [his voice breaks a bit from crying] Airsoft is seriously, like, the greatest thing in the whole world. Well, here's my house. Thanks, you guys. For just a few, brief hours I forgot how much everything sucks. [he walks back home] Can we promise each other we'll do Airsoft, like, all the time? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96321,Cartman,[softly] I love you guys. [he makes his way inside his hot dog house] 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96362,Cartman,"Dude, Swamp Sniper rules. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96364,Cartman,"[confused] Hello? [his teenager says nothing] What– What are you doing, dude? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96366,Cartman,You– You need to use my bathroom? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96399,Cartman,[he walks up to Kyle] Kyle? What are you doing here? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96404,Cartman,"Well, at least I'm not the only one dealing with this crap. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96407,Cartman,"No, my teenager wants more lotion. [he takes Kyle to the side to talk with him privately] All this guy does is hang out in the bathroom and go through like two bottles of lotion a day. I swear I don't know how soft you could possibly want your hands to be. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96409,Cartman,[excitedly] Damn right! Team Floppy Weiner will destroy you guys! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96411,Cartman,You have to find me first! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96413,Cartman,"Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! There's one over by the registers. No, you are not taking the lotion! [he grabs it from his teenager] "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96415,Cartman,"Okay, I'm sorry you hate me. Just wanna fucking play Airsoft, buddy. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96445,Cartman,"On the rare occasion that my teenager isn't in the bathroom, all he does is talk about his miserable life. I'm like—okay, dude, I've got problems too. But of course teenagers don't care about your problems. I'm like, ""look, buddy, I live in a hot dog. Ok? Like, maybe let's stop bitching and just play Airsoft."" But you can't say that because then they're just gonna— "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96447,Cartman,"Yes, yes. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96459,Cartman,[side-eyes Kenny] Camping? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96470,Cartman,"[waiting outside the bathroom] Okay, looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96472,Cartman,"Okay, well, you should probably finish up. I know you took the lotion in there. You really don't need soft hands for camping. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96474,Cartman,"[Cartman tries opening the door, but it's locked, so he knocks] Come on, dude. No shit in the world takes that long. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96500,Cartman,Up to here! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96504,Cartman,"Guys, things have to improve. They just have to. I've never seen anyone so disrespectful. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96506,Cartman,"I've never seen Kenny like this, ever. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96519,Cartman,That's awesome. I wish I had a dad. And that I didn't live in a hot dog. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96530,Cartman,I know where he is… [Cartman walks up to the bathrooms] I'm so sick of this crap… [he cocks his gon and kicks the door in] 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96532,Cartman,"What you do to Jegens Lotion isn't right. [Cartman sets his rifle to full auto, and starts shooting the teenager] "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96534,Cartman,[shooting the whole cartridge] Aaaagh! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96556,Cartman,"Yes… yes, I live in a hot dog! It's right over here! Come on, you guys, help me get it all ready! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96599,Cartman,"[unenthusiastically] Yeah, it's super fun. St. Patrick's Day rules. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96684,Cartman,Awesome... green hamburgers... How clever... 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96710,Cartman,"Hello, sir, we are with the Clover Club. We try to spread a little St. Patrick's Day cheer by donating baked goods to prison inmates who cannot celebrate this festive time. [the officer accompanies the boys to the cell room] "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96718,Cartman,"How's your St. Patrick's Day going, Butters? "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96720,Cartman,Awesome. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96820,Cartman,"Yeah, nobody really gives a shit about your TikToks, guys. [Bebe and Red walk by.] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96833,Cartman,"What the fuck is this? Seriously, what the fuck is this? Have you guys noticed that Kyle and Tolkien are, like, doing everything together lately? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96837,Cartman,Wow. I feel really bad for Stan. It's gotta be hard to suddenly have your best friend always hanging with someone else. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96839,Cartman,I gotta see if there's some way I can help. There's a little voice inside of me that can't stand to see my friend suffer. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96841,Cartman,I'm gonna be a good Christian. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96845,Cartman,"Hey, Tolkien! What's goin' on? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96847,Cartman,"Yeah, I know. I was just - I was noticing that you're kind of hanging out a lot with Kyle lately. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96849,Cartman,"No, I think it's amazing. It's awesome that someone like you could be okay with someone like him, given all the new information lately. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96851,Cartman,"You know, the stuff that's come out about how the Jews stole the black race's identity, that the lost tribes of Judah were actually all Africans. [He plays his clarinet, poorly.] You didn't hear about this? Black people are actually the Jews and people like Kyle have taken that from them? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96853,Cartman,"When the Jews came to America to escape persecution in World War II, they found that Blacks were already the underclass in America, so they had to invent a story for themselves which they can make everyone believe... [The music in the room comes to a sudden stop] ...because Kyle runs Hollywood! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96855,Cartman,"[quietly] Kyle runs Hollywood, Tolkien. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96858,Cartman,"Hey, Stan. Guess what? I have some good news for you. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96860,Cartman,A little magic fairy told me that you and Kyle are gonna get back together soon. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96862,Cartman,"Yes, you do. But don't worry, Stan. It's almost Valentine's Day. And the little angel on my shoulder says that Kyle is gonna come running back to you any minute! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96867,Cartman,Uh-huh. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96874,Cartman,The fuck is going on? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96876,Cartman,I don't get it. The little cupid is always right. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96878,Cartman,Why didn't Tolkien listen? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96881,Cartman,"Yeah, I told him everything, Cupid Ye! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96883,Cartman,"Yeah, but it didn't work, Cupid Ye. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96885,Cartman,"You're right, Cupid Ye. Can you help make sure Tolkien hears our message? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96903,Cartman,"I think... I did say that, yes. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96905,Cartman,Somebody runs Hollywood. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96907,Cartman,"Yes, lots of... people like Kyle. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96909,Cartman,"I'm sorry, why is it so offensive to say who runs Hollywood? People like Hollywood. Hollywood's cool. The Jews should be honored to be in charge of it. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96911,Cartman,"Two months?! Jesus, Mary mother full of grace... You guys really take this seriously. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96913,Cartman,"Please help me be the best Christian I can be. All I want is to help people, but nobody understands. Please, I can't do this alone. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96916,Cartman,"There you are, Cupid Ye! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96918,Cartman,"The principal said I can't talk about Kyle running Hollywood anymore, Cupid Ye! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96920,Cartman,"Who's ""they""? Oh, right... ""them"". "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96922,Cartman,"But Cupid Ye, I have to get to Tolkien or else Stan is gonna be sad forever! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96924,Cartman,"Thanks. Just, don't do anything too drastic, okay? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96926,Cartman,"I dunno, it's just... ever since you changed your name and got all into Jesus, you've been acting a bit bat shit crazy, Cupid Ye. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96941,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96970,Cartman,"Stan? Sometimes, Jesus works slowly. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96993,Cartman,"Well, mostly I just mean that Jews control everything we see on TV and the movies. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96995,Cartman,"Well, that’s ‘cause there’s this one Jew -- um, his name is Kyle. And he can totally retaliate me, ‘cause he like, runs Hollywood. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96997,Cartman,"Yeah, especially black people. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96999,Cartman,[Cartman keeps talking on the TV while Tolkien watches.] That’s because of all the new information lately. The new information about how the chosen people were actually Africans. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97000,Cartman,"[Back at the new’s station.] So, you know, black people have really been hurt by the Jews. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97002,Cartman,"Yeah, so-- woah, woah, Cupid Ye. That’s going a bit too far. He’s just trying to be shocking. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97027,Cartman,"[From behind the bushes.] Oh my God, this is so awesome. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97035,Cartman,[Both Tolkien and Kyle leave in opposite directions.] We did it. I can’t believe we did it! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97037,Cartman,And now Stan can have his best friend back. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97039,Cartman,"Woah, woah, okay. Cupid Ye, you mean our Christian message. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97041,Cartman,"Cupid Ye, are you okay? Do you need to, like, talk to somebody? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97043,Cartman,"Okay, Cupid Ye, time to go back inside. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97045,Cartman,"C’mon, let’s go, Ye! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97049,Cartman,"Yeeeee! [Cupid Ye drives away, crashing into another car and taking a hard turn left.] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97050,Cartman,"Yeeeeeeeeee! Oh, shit. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97053,Cartman,"[Cartman barges into the room, closing the door and locking it behind him.] Stan! We aren’t safe! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97055,Cartman,"[Cartman proceeds to lock the windows, as well.] He’s totally gotten crazy! I don’t think I can reason with him anymore! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97057,Cartman,"Stan, listen to me. There’s someone who’s been messing with Kyle and Tolkien. He said it was to be a good Christian, but… But I think he’s just been using Christianity as an excuse to be a racist piece of shit. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97059,Cartman,"Not me, Stan! This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but… There’s a little magic angel that comes each year around Valentine’s Day. He spreads love and brings lonely people together. But this year is different. Cupid Me found Christ and changed his name. And I have to find a way to get him back on his meds. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97061,Cartman,"Stan, do you believe in Santa Claus? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97063,Cartman,Do you believe in the Easter Bunny? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97065,Cartman,Then believe that tomorrow is Valentine’s Day… and there’s no telling what Cupid Ye is capable of. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97106,Cartman,[Out of frame.] Cupid Yeeeeee!! [The group turns around to stare at Cartman as he holds a bottle of pills. Cartman shakes the bottle.] Time to take your meds. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97108,Cartman,"[Cartman starts walking towards Cupid Ye.] You’re taking your meds, Ye! One way or another! [As the mob of hypnotized students tries to stop him, Cartman punches them away.] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97110,Cartman,You’re taking your medication! [Cupid Me tries to escape.] 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97112,Cartman,"You’re taking it, Ye! [Cupid Me struggles, Cartman holds him back.] Swallow it, swallow it! Swallow it, swallow it! [Cupid Me grunts as Cartman shoves the pills into his mouth.] Ye? Ye? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97115,Cartman,Cupid Me?! You guys! It's Cupid Me! He’s back! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97117,Cartman,"Why, it’s Valentine’s Day, Cupid Me! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97119,Cartman,[Cartman cheers.] Yeah! 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97160,Cartman,"Yeah, we were all waiting. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97162,Cartman,You didn't ruin it for anyone. We played without you. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97165,Cartman,"We got some sweet drip, dude. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97171,Cartman,"Nice, sweet drip, dude! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97253,Cartman,"Yeah, we are literally dripping with drip. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97283,Cartman,"Stan, are you gonna say something? "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97294,Cartman,Thank you. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97324,Cartman,[also unamused] Cool. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97486,Cartman,"Stan, just so you know, nobody gives a shit. "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97488,Cartman,"Come on, guys! [he walks away with the other boys] "
26,4,Deep Learning,97752,Cartman,"Ah, yes, thank you, thank you. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97756,Cartman,"Alright, what the hell is going on? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97758,Cartman,"Clearly, somebody told Stan about Chat GPT! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97760,Cartman,"Yes, we are all using it, and we had a pact that we wouldn't tell anyone else because then everyone will start using it, and Mr. Garrison will figure it out! So who the [bleep] blabbed to Stan? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97762,Cartman,"God damn it, Clyde! You don't use an amazing AI cheating tool to talk to girls! You're gonna ruin everything! This can't be open source, you guys! If everyone starts using Chat GPT, then we lose our unfair advantage. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97764,Cartman,"Oh, god-[bleep]-damn it. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97766,Cartman,"If they find out that we don't have to work anymore, then they aren't gonna want to work and then we're all screwed! Who's the one who first found Chat GPT and thought to use it for essays? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97768,Cartman,"Right. But then Butters told me about it, and I told him not to tell anyone else! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97770,Cartman,That's right. I was a little excited. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97772,Cartman,"Fine. So we're all in it together. But you guys need to be careful what you use it for. Because once you bring girls into things, they're gonna ruin it. Just like slavery. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97838,Cartman,"Oh, God, so obvious. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97853,Cartman,They...They are gonna what? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97861,Cartman,God fucking dammit! I told you guys this was gonna happen! 
26,4,Deep Learning,97863,Cartman,"There's nothing we can do. It's over, we've lost our unfair advantage. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97866,Cartman,"And who's fault is that, you guys? I told you that once you bring women into things, they ruin it just like they did slavery. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97868,Cartman,"No, I can't! Because I can't use fucking ChatGPT anymore 'cause we got fucking busted! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97870,Cartman,"It doesn't matter if it doesn't work. Cat is out of the bag now! This was supposed to be our thing, for us to get ahead, but now- "
26,4,Deep Learning,97872,Cartman,"God dammit, Get the fuck out of here! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97949,Cartman,"Hey! Screw you, you dumb Jew! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97973,Cartman,"Butters, what the hell are you wearing? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97975,Cartman,That's not fair! I want a paycheck! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97977,Cartman,I want a bank account! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97980,Cartman,I want to take whatever I can get! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97982,Cartman,That is messed up! Why does he get to have a job? I want a job! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97984,Cartman,"Excuse me? That's easy for you to say! You don't need a job, 'cause you live in a nice house! I have to live in a shithole like Kenny does! It's not fair that some people in our country are given the opportunity for employment, while others aren't! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97986,Cartman,I'm gonna tell my mom! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97989,Cartman,Mom! Mom! I need your permission to get a job. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97991,Cartman,Butters got a job! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97993,Cartman,"Mom! Look at this shithole we live in! Somebody has to get a job, 'cause you just sit on your ass all day! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97995,Cartman,"Yes! Right! Because I'm the man of the house. You're supposed to take care of me, and I'm supposed to go get a job. You really expect us to live like this the rest of our lives? This is not a proper place to raise a child! You have to go let me find a job, Mom! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97997,Cartman,"Oh! Now you sound like Kyle! Do you run Hollywood with him? Are you a Jew too, Mom? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97999,Cartman,"Thanks, Mom! I love you! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98007,Cartman,"Hey, Butters! I'm here for my job. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98009,Cartman,['My mom gave me permission I can start work now. What do I do? ']
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98011,Cartman,"Yeah, I want your job, sitting around eating ice cream. Sounds fun. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98015,Cartman,"Hello, sir. I'm a dear friend of Butters. He told me all about this place and said I should get permission from my mom to work here. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98021,Cartman,"Hey, man! I got a job! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98024,Cartman,"Uh-huh, and when do we get to have breaks? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98026,Cartman,"Okay, and how much longer do we have to be here? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98032,Cartman,Why? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98034,Cartman,"Whoa, Butters. Let's not make this a toxic work environment, okay? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98037,Cartman,"[on the phone] Yeah, I got a job in an ice cream shop. Yeah, it's dumb as hell, but I'm going to start getting paychecks. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98040,Cartman,"Yeah, I know. She's pretty hot, but she's got droopy boobs. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98042,Cartman,"[to Butters] Yeah, I can. It's Monday. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98044,Cartman,So haven't you heard of Bare Minimum Mondays? It's a thing that young people created because we care about our mental health. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98047,Cartman,"Oh, break time. I'll be back. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98059,Cartman,"Hey, Butters! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98061,Cartman,I wasn't feeling the best so I decided to work from home. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98065,Cartman,"Yeah, no, 'cause see, I'm actually taking a mental health day. Yeah, young people can just ask for a mental health day and employers can't deny them. It's my mental health day. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98067,Cartman,"Okay, I guess so. But don't forget that tomorrow is Take-it-Easy Tuesday. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98071,Cartman,"You know what's total bullcrap, Butters? It's how much money the owner of this place is making while we're out here busting our asses. I mean, what does that old fart even do? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98073,Cartman,"Oh, yes, let me get that for you, master, right away now. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98074,Cartman,"I mean, seriously, Butters, why do we have to work for the owner? We know how to do all this stuff now. We don't even need that guy. There has to be a way we could turn the tables. There has to be a way we could make all the money. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98076,Cartman,Wait a minute... 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98078,Cartman,Butters! Butters! That's it! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98083,Cartman,Kenny! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98085,Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, you're not going to believe this, but I just quit my job. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98087,Cartman,"Yes, I had a job. But I got fed up, sick of working my fingers to the bone for some piece-of-shit owner. And that's when it hit me. Kenny, we should open a restaurant. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98089,Cartman,"You know the hot dog I've been living in? It's an old, like, historic landmark. It's been sitting right in front of us completely ready to go! All it would take is some minor renovations and some care. We can make it awesome with, like, fun things for kids to do, and rides and games. A place that people from all over Colorado would want to come and see! And we would be the owners. And we could have all the hot dogs we wanted. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98091,Cartman,"Aren't you sick of living like this, Kenny? All we need is an investor, and we can make our dreams come true. And I know somebody who has a bank account and gets paychecks every week. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98094,Cartman,"Butters, don't you want to invest your money in something that matters? That's why we came to your bank to offer you this awesome deal. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98097,Cartman,"No, you keep working at the ice cream shop. We're going to open the hot dog. All you do is collect the money as the investor. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98099,Cartman,"Butters, it's just like... You're lucky, you know? You have money. But look at Kenny. Can you imagine what it's like for him watching rich white boys like you just collecting paycheck after paycheck, while he wallows in the filth of his tiny house? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98101,Cartman,"Butters, Kenny deserves a chance to be able to work like you do. Please, give him that chance. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98103,Cartman,"And we pay you back as soon as we make our first dollar, Butters. You have my word on it. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98105,Cartman,Yeah! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98107,Cartman,"Guys, we're going into the restaurant business. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98109,Cartman,"This is going to be the best restaurant in Colorado, Kenny. And I know exactly what we should name it. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98113,Cartman,[laughs] He said it! We got him to say DikinBaus! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98116,Cartman,[laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98119,Cartman,[laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98121,Cartman,Let DikinBaus put a smile on your buns! [laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98123,Cartman,"Oh. Hey, Butters. We have some of those first-quarter projections to show you. Do you have the first-quarter projections, Kenny? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98126,Cartman,"No, we are renovating and opening an amazing restaurant that will be extremely profitable. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98128,Cartman,"Butters, you are the investor. We are the creatives. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98130,Cartman,"Butters, at DikinBaus, dicking around is all we do, dicking around the competition. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98132,Cartman,[laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98137,Cartman,"Okay, that's good! Mermaid goes to the mermaid grotto right over there. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98139,Cartman,"Mom, no offense, but will you shut your mouth because you know nothing about the restaurant business? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98141,Cartman,"Yes, we're the owners. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98143,Cartman,"So, what does that mean? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98145,Cartman,"Well, obviously, we're not going to lose the zip line, so let's see what we can do. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98147,Cartman,"Jesus Christ. Well, I guess we got to find a way to add plumbing. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98148,Cartman,"Alright, everyone, it's looking good, but we have aways to go. I don't know about you, but I am exhausted. I think we should all just take the rest of the day off because it's Wet's-Not-Work-Too-Hard Wednesday. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98169,Cartman,"Oh, man. It's the stupid bank. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98171,Cartman,"Hey, Butters. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98173,Cartman,Butters. Butters! Would you relax? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98175,Cartman,You said to get things moving. We needed the funds to go faster. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98177,Cartman,"Butters, we're about to reopen a historic landmark that means something to people. You think I'm just doing all this for the fun of it? Hang on a second. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98179,Cartman,"We're creating jobs, Butters! And we're helping people. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98181,Cartman,"Fine! We'll start hiring tomorrow morning and we'll be open by the afternoon. And trust me, Butters, when we open and you see how successful it is, you're going to apologize to me. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98183,Cartman,What the hell is going on? Why is nobody showing up? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98186,Cartman,Hey! Hey! Excuse me! You want to come work at DikinBaus for minimum wage? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98189,Cartman,That's 'cause your generation is lazy! You got all comfy during the pandemic! Nobody knows how to work anymore! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98192,Cartman,"Yes! Please, have a seat. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98194,Cartman,"Um, so, what kind of experience do you have? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98200,Cartman,"Well, I believe that we here at DikinBaus would like to hire you immediately. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98203,Cartman,"No, you can't work from home. It's a hot dog stand! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98205,Cartman,"Where do people get this stuff? Alright, fine. Never mind, we don't want to hire you. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98209,Cartman,"Good morning, everyone. After an exhaustive search for employees, we have determined that you are the best of the best. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98211,Cartman,Yes. We're sure you're excited to be part of the DikinBaus team. And we are certainly glad to have you here. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98213,Cartman,"Shut up, Scott. Now listen, it's going to take dedication and drive to get this place open. Isn't that right, Kenny? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98215,Cartman,"Sorry, Kenny's working from home today 'cause it's his mental health day. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98218,Cartman,"Now, there may not be many of us. But in order to open, we're going to have to... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98220,Cartman,"Oh, here we go. Fine, Clyde, what days do you need to have mental health days? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98222,Cartman,"Goddammit, you guys! It isn't going to work like this, okay? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98224,Cartman,"You're fucking joking! This is a goddamn restaurant, you guys! There's no time for diabetes! You don't here Mrs. Anderson complaining about her time off! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98226,Cartman,"Oh, that's it! That's it! I give up! It's impossible to open any kind of business these days when this generation doesn't know how to work! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98229,Cartman,"Oh, great! Now the bank is here. Scrooge McButters to collect on his money. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98231,Cartman,"Butters, the truth is, we tried. The fact of the matter is, the U.S. government failed this generation by shutting down businesses in the pandemic, and now they don't know how to go back. I'm sorry, but we lost all your money. But there is a good side to this because, as you can see, I now have a house that has slides, and games, and a mermaid grotto. And you can come and hang out all you want. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98239,Cartman,"You guys, it's working! We're doing it! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98246,Cartman,Oh my God! Oh my God! This is a dream come true! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98261,Cartman,"No! No, what are you doing? DikinBaus is mine! You can't sell DikinBaus! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98263,Cartman,No! Take me back! No! Please! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98266,Cartman,What is this? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98268,Cartman,I don't want my old house! I want DikinBaus! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98270,Cartman,No! No! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98272,Cartman,But I hate this stupid house! I don't want to be here! I want to be in DikinBaus! DikinBaus is awesome! This place sucks! Please! I want DikinBaus! I want my DikinBaus! DikinBaus! DikinBaus! 
13,2,The Coon,62426,The Coon,"[voice over. The Coon is on the roof of a public restroom house looking through the binoculars] A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon. "
13,2,The Coon,62428,The Coon,[leaps into action] Let her go! 
13,2,The Coon,62430,The Coon,You aren't raping anyone tonight! 
13,2,The Coon,62434,The Coon,[stops clawing and says to Lisa] Get out of here! Get to safety! [Lisa gets up and runs away screaming. The Coon gets back to clawing at Josh] 
13,2,The Coon,62436,The Coon,[voice over as he leaps off the chair and runs off] Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there? 
13,2,The Coon,62441,The Coon,"Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet. "
13,2,The Coon,62444,The Coon,There was another rapist in the park tonight. [jumps into the station] It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and it stinks to the top. 
13,2,The Coon,62446,The Coon,I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash. 
13,2,The Coon,62449,The Coon,"[steps out from behind a file cabinet at the other end of the floor] No, I'm just over here now. [all the detectives turn to face him] What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences? "
13,2,The Coon,62453,The Coon,[appears by the window again] Now I'm back over here. 
13,2,The Coon,62455,The Coon,I'm right here now. [the camera moves to the right until he appears] 
13,2,The Coon,62457,The Coon,"Yes, I have to go now. [turns to the window, reaches over and grabs a box, and carries it over to the officers] But in the meantime I have something that might interest you. [turns and walks back to the window] Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective! "
13,2,The Coon,62472,The Coon,"[voice over] Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city. [another little superhero walks up to the edge of roof a few feet from the Coon] And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are- [the Coon notices] Who the hell is that? [looks the new hero over a few times, then walks up to him and asks] Who the hell are you? "
13,2,The Coon,62474,The Coon,"Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs! [M ignores him] Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first! "
13,2,The Coon,62476,The Coon,Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat? 
13,2,The Coon,62478,The Coon,"Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb! "
13,2,The Coon,62480,The Coon,Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either. 
13,2,The Coon,62482,The Coon,[thinks for a few seconds] Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?! 
13,2,The Coon,62484,The Coon,"Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle! "
13,2,The Coon,62486,The Coon,"No, I'm no- I [makes his voice gruff again] I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am! "
13,2,The Coon,62488,The Coon,"NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you! [no one replies] Motherfucker! "
13,2,The Coon,62493,The Coon,"[alone in the room] How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous! "
13,2,The Coon,62495,The Coon,"Yes, it's fine! "
13,2,The Coon,62497,The Coon,"What do you mean ""continued""? You don't know who I am! "
13,2,The Coon,62499,The Coon,"No, I'm not that kid! "
13,2,The Coon,62501,The Coon,[looks back at him] You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here! 
13,2,The Coon,62533,The Coon,"Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop! "
13,2,The Coon,62536,The Coon,"That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop! "
13,2,The Coon,62538,The Coon,"Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole! [to the officers on the second floor] Hey, he's got fireworks! "
13,2,The Coon,62553,The Coon,"[voice over] I had no choice. [he peeks out from behind a building, then runs] I was at the end of my rope. [he hears a sound and turns to its direction] Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society. "
13,2,The Coon,62555,The Coon,Come out where I can see you! 
13,2,The Coon,62557,The Coon,"[voice over] I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need. "
13,2,The Coon,62559,The Coon,"[voice over] Chaos. I need to keep on my toes. [speaks] I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information. "
13,2,The Coon,62561,The Coon,"I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. [the two adversaries begin to circle each other] "
13,2,The Coon,62563,The Coon,I'm not on his side! 
13,2,The Coon,62565,The Coon,That's it! [stands up] 
13,2,The Coon,62567,The Coon,"Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off! "
13,2,The Coon,62569,The Coon,Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion! 
13,2,The Coon,62571,The Coon,"Because Mysterion is trying to [bumps General Disarray off. General Disarray strikes a couple of trash cans and gets up a bit dazed] You fucker, that fuckin' hurt! [turns towards Professor Chaos] Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job! "
13,2,The Coon,62573,The Coon,"Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do! "
13,2,The Coon,62575,The Coon,"N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people. "
13,2,The Coon,62577,The Coon,"[voice over] I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move. "
13,2,The Coon,62590,The Coon,You guys have your own storage facility? 
13,2,The Coon,62592,The Coon,I'll take a Sprite. 
13,2,The Coon,62594,The Coon,"You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that ""Who Is The Coon?"" T-shirt I gave you? "
13,2,The Coon,62596,The Coon,"Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion. "
13,2,The Coon,62598,The Coon,"Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all. "
13,2,The Coon,62606,The Coon,"If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats? "
13,2,The Coon,62608,The Coon,"Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos. "
13,2,The Coon,62610,The Coon,"You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?! [turns and runs to the edge of the floor] Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! [jumps down to the ground] "
13,2,The Coon,62633,The Coon,[walking up a ramp to the first floor] Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day. 
13,2,The Coon,62637,The Coon,"Don't worry, Mysterion! [Mysterion gets off Chaos and Chaos stands up] The Coon will now help you! "
13,2,The Coon,62639,The Coon,"That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time. "
13,2,The Coon,62641,The Coon,"Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. [Mysterion gives this some thought.] "
13,2,The Coon,62645,The Coon,Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good. 
13,2,The Coon,62648,The Coon,So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?! 
13,2,The Coon,62652,The Coon,I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before! 
13,2,The Coon,62655,The Coon,"[voice over] My entire plan worked to perfection. [holds up his right hand] My work here is done. [leaps away, then appears on the roof of a building] With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe. [runs across the roof and leaps down, holding on to the sides of a ladder. He leaps off the bottom of the ladder and plants his right hand on the ground] Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind. [he eats a burger meal at a fast food restaurant] Every town needs a hero. [walks down a street towards sunset] Every town needs... a Coon. [looks back at the camera, then turns away and resumes walking. Last scene has the Coon riding down the street on his Big Coon Wheel tricycle] "
