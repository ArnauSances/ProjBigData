1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,190,Wendy,"Here, Stan. This is for you. [Wendy hands Stan a note.] "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,192,Wendy,Eww! [She leaves.] 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,329,Wendy,"Hi, Stan. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,331,Wendy,Eww! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,333,Wendy,"But why, Stan? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,336,Wendy,Eww! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,338,Wendy,[Turns to Kyle.] Huh? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,340,Wendy,What happened to your little brother? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,360,Wendy,"Well, why don't you go get the fat kid? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,362,Wendy,"Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,364,Wendy,"Come on, Stan. [She walks past him, following Kyle.] "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,366,Wendy,Eww! [She walks away.] 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,394,Wendy,"Hey, he's like Rudolph. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,470,Wendy,"Whatever, dude. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,472,Wendy,Cool! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,476,Wendy,Eww! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,478,Wendy,"Hey, look. A French fry. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,480,Wendy,And what is that? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,483,Wendy,"Hey, what's that? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,485,Wendy,"Oh hey, what about that? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,524,Wendy,"[Softly.] Wow, I knew I would win. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,527,Wendy,What? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,536,Wendy,He doesn't even know what he wrote about! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,538,Wendy,My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,542,Wendy,What? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,563,Wendy,[Passing by.] Hitler was famous too. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,613,Wendy,"Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,735,Wendy,Hi guys. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,742,Wendy,I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,758,Wendy,Hello? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,760,Wendy,"My essay by Eric Cartman: ""When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."" "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,763,Wendy,[Hushed.] Oh my God. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,783,Wendy,"[Rushing in.] You guys, we have to stop him! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,785,Wendy,Mr. Garrison! He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,787,Wendy,He's got a gun! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,789,Wendy,"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,791,Wendy,"[Sweetly.] Stan, I can't do it alone. Please? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,816,Wendy,"[Wendy and Stan run up.] Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,833,Wendy,I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,835,Wendy,You should have won that talent show. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,841,Wendy,"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,844,Wendy,"You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,847,Wendy,Gooood. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,865,Wendy,You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,867,Wendy,"I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,871,Wendy,"Well, not if it's Cartman. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,873,Wendy,"Hey, where are you all going! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,875,Wendy,They don't even know what Walden is. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,877,Wendy,I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,879,Wendy,"Ah, what the hell. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2892,Wendy,"Hi, Stan. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2894,Wendy,Yeahhh? 
1,7,Pinkeye,2896,Wendy,"I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2898,Wendy,"I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2916,Wendy,Eww. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3018,Wendy,Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3070,Wendy,Hi guys. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3073,Wendy,"Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3075,Wendy,Let's go trick-or-treats. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3077,Wendy,"Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3080,Wendy,But Stan! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3083,Wendy,AAAAAAAAAAAH! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3253,Wendy,Aaahahah! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3261,Wendy,Aaahh. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3269,Wendy,Aaah! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3271,Wendy,Aaah! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3275,Wendy,"Oh, what happened? Stan? "
1,7,Pinkeye,3280,Wendy,I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3282,Wendy,Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3284,Wendy,"Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross! "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3380,Wendy,Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?! 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3382,Wendy,This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat! 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3384,Wendy,Many would rather die than go to those places! 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3785,Wendy,Unh [labored breathing] Oh! 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3787,Wendy,Aaaah! 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3789,Wendy,UUuuhh-UUuuhh. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3798,Wendy,Okay. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3831,Wendy,"You guys, look! It's snowing! "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3835,Wendy,Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3837,Wendy,It's fun. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4180,Wendy,Yeah. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4197,Wendy,I believe in Mr. Hankey. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4728,Wendy,"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4730,Wendy,Maybe we should go on a cruise or something. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4733,Wendy,"I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4739,Wendy, -and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4767,Wendy,[Gasps.] Stan? Stan?! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4813,Wendy,"[Approaching.] Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4815,Wendy,Well it is! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4819,Wendy,"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4822,Wendy,"[Panicking a little.] Stan? We're still Valentines, right? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4899,Wendy,"Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4902,Wendy,"I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4904,Wendy,"Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4907,Wendy,Don't fuck with me! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4909,Wendy,"You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4911,Wendy,"[Sweetly.] Bye, Ms. Ellen. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4937,Wendy,"When someone gets as old as you, "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4939,Wendy,Do they have to wear Depends undergarments? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4945,Wendy,"Hi, Stan. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4947,Wendy,"HI, STAN! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4949,Wendy,"I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4951,Wendy,"Yes, she was! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4953,Wendy,"Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4955,Wendy,It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4959,Wendy,NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5018,Wendy,"Thanks for coming over, Bebe. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5021,Wendy,"That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5023,Wendy,"Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5034,Wendy,"Hi guys, what's up? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5038,Wendy,"Oh. Hi, Stan. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5040,Wendy,"I think it worked, Bebe. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5051,Wendy,DIE!! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5058,Wendy,Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5060,Wendy,"He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5065,Wendy,Wwhat? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5067,Wendy,You...you can't. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5078,Wendy,Noooo! Noooo! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5081,Wendy,Nooo!! Nooo!! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5083,Wendy,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5107,Wendy,It's over. I give up. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5132,Wendy,Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5134,Wendy,No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5136,Wendy,"No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5138,Wendy,"And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong, "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5140,Wendy,...and I've learned from it. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5142,Wendy,"I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5167,Wendy,"Oh, coool! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5179,Wendy,Wow. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5181,Wendy,What incredible irony. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5184,Wendy,"Yeah, you just never know. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5186,Wendy,"Happy Valentine's Day, Staan. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5190,Wendy,Eeewwww! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5193,Wendy,"No, it's okay, Stan! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5195,Wendy,Everything's going to be o-kay! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5212,Wendy,"Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5215,Wendy,"Oh, hi, Kyle! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5217,Wendy,U-huh. Excuse me. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5219,Wendy,Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!

1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5223,Wendy,Kaqemblaq! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5228,Wendy,"Wait, wait! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5230,Wendy,It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5232,Wendy,"Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5234,Wendy,I told her. [suddenly gains white irises] Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9158,Wendy,"Hey, he's like Rudolph. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9180,Wendy,Mmmm. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9321,Wendy,But Mr. Garrison! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9329,Wendy,Mmmm. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10084,Wendy,Wow! Cool! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10089,Wendy,No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10091,Wendy,"Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10093,Wendy,(Gasp)! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10140,Wendy,"Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10149,Wendy,"Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10166,Wendy,Sshh! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10367,Wendy,"Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10452,Wendy,"[Arriving.] Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? [Damn.] "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10462,Wendy,Eeewww! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10562,Wendy,"[Stopping by.] Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10564,Wendy,"Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11353,Wendy,"Yeah, me too! Me too! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11610,Wendy,"Hi, Stan. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11612,Wendy,"Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11615,Wendy,She does. She looks very pretty. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11617,Wendy,"Stan, can I talk to you for a second? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11619,Wendy,"Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11621,Wendy,"If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11623,Wendy,"Yeah, Stan. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11625,Wendy,You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11631,Wendy,"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11639,Wendy,"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11774,Wendy,Is the clubhouse ready? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11874,Wendy,"Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11876,Wendy,"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare! "
2,12,Clubhouses,12016,Wendy,"[Entering the clubhouse.] Hi, guys. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12026,Wendy,I will. Kyle? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12028,Wendy,Truth or Dare? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12033,Wendy,[Whispers.] How about we give him Bebe? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12035,Wendy,[Whispers.] Okay. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12037,Wendy,Kiss Bebe on the lips! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12039,Wendy,"What's the matter, Kyle? "
2,12,Clubhouses,12052,Wendy,"Your turn, Bebe. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12061,Wendy,"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12190,Wendy,"Wow, that sucks! Do you think it'll hurt? "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16692,Wendy,"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16858,Wendy,[joins the group] What's happening? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16860,Wendy,Oh cool! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16867,Wendy,"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16883,Wendy,"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16957,Wendy,Yeah! [the girls begin to file out of class] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19086,Wendy,"Dare ga pu shita no. [""Who farted?""] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22154,Wendy,1776
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23284,Wendy,"It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23672,Wendy,"We'll march with you, Chef. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23705,Wendy,How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23708,Wendy,[upset] Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23712,Wendy,[mortified] Nooo! [Cartman chuckles some more] 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23727,Wendy,"Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w- "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23729,Wendy,[glares at him for a few seconds] Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23731,Wendy,[stunned] What?? 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23737,Wendy,"[walks up to him] Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23739,Wendy,The South Park flag! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23741,Wendy,D'aaaaahhh! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23779,Wendy,"This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they- "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23781,Wendy,If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case- 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23783,Wendy,"Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23785,Wendy,"That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23828,Wendy,"I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23830,Wendy,"Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23832,Wendy,Huh? 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23834,Wendy,"[mulls over the argument] Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23836,Wendy,Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. [takes a cookie] 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23838,Wendy,Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. [starts eating] 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23840,Wendy,"Hey, that's what I always do, too! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23842,Wendy,"Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23844,Wendy,Aha ha. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23848,Wendy,"Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag. [reaches for a cookie] We can show that the- [Cartman's hand rests on hers. Their eyes meet and the music crescendos] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23850,Wendy,"No. [shoves the plate back, Music fades.] You go ahead. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23874,Wendy,"[turns and runs to him] Cartman! [Cartman gets off the steed and runs to Wendy, his hair billowing in the wind] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23876,Wendy,Say it'll be like this forever. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23878,Wendy,"Oh, Cartman! [Cartman looks at her, his hair billowing in the wind] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23880,Wendy,"AAAAAAaaaah! [pants heavily, then dunks her head in the fish bowl on the little desk next to her bed.] Brrrrr. What's wrong with me? [hops down and heads for the bathroom, flips the lights on, goes to the sink, hops on a stool, and checks out her tongue and eyes, while Russell Crowe poster behind her stares on] Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. [hops down and heads for the switch. She's about to turn off the lights when a voice stops her] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23882,Wendy,[shocked at the hallucination] Aaaah! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23884,Wendy,"[turns around, looks up, then sits down with her face in her hands] Oh God, please don't let this be happening. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23917,Wendy,"[leads Bebe in] Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23919,Wendy,"Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23921,Wendy,[ashamed] I know. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23923,Wendy,"Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job- "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23925,Wendy,"You mean, I should kiss him? [looks away embarrassed] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23927,Wendy,[dreading] Oh God. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23930,Wendy,"[Piano music implying a pending dramatic moment approaches. Wendy looks at the audience] The- [looks at Cartman] the- uh, [clears her throat] aheh ahum, [looks at Cartman] the… the- uh, [closes her eyes and pushes her hands out as if to push away the feelings swirling within] Ahhhhh, [exhales softly, then sighs] The first argument we- [her eyes snap back to Cartman, who's still watching her.

[steps down and kisses a surprised Cartman full on the lips while she makes high pitched, humming sounds] Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee... "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23933,Wendy,"[confident now] There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. [steps down as people clap. Stan is still in shock that Wendy kissed Cartman. She sits down, Cartman looks at her, then places his hands behind his head in a supreme air of confidence and looks away] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23968,Wendy,Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. [the applause begins to die down] 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23970,Wendy,"[applause stops, background music plays] I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23972,Wendy,I'm totally back to normal. See you later. [the crowd disperses behind her as she pats Cartman's shoulder] 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23974,Wendy,"Hahaha. [looks off to her right] Stan. Stan, wait up! [hurries away to catch up to him. Cartman looks at her, then away, then at her long, then away, than at her quick one last time, then looks down and sighs. He turns to his left and walks away, dejected] "

4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25848,Wendy,"Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25850,Wendy,Oh no! NO! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25852,Wendy,My poor little Helen. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25854,Wendy,"She can't see or hear us, John. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25879,Wendy,"I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25908,Wendy,Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25999,Wendy,"Oh, no! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26082,Wendy," John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick [Stan rushes in] When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.   "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26084,Wendy,"She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26086,Wendy, ...Helen! [the audience stares in disbelief] I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!   
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26088,Wendy,"Oh no! Oh no!!! [both collapse to the floor, and the curtains close. Alinicia trots in and gets the spotlight. She then performs her feats. She hops up on a small stand, walks a tightrope, and hops off the stand at the other end. She hops through a hoop and lands on a third stand, then pulls the cover off a sign introducing the next scene: ""Scene 2, Eight Years Later"" and takes a bow. A few people clap] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26108,Wendy,There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26444,Wendy,"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29697,Wendy,"Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29701,Wendy,I didn't mean that- 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29722,Wendy,"Stay away from me, Stan! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29724,Wendy,Are you wearing a condom? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29730,Wendy,Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29738,Wendy,"You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29878,Wendy,"[at the helm of a gun turret] Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant! "

6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35373,Wendy,I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? [Bebe walks in] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35375,Wendy,Hey Bebe. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35377,Wendy,"[the three girls gaze] Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs! "

6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35481,Wendy,[angrily] No! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35484,Wendy,Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35489,Wendy,"I heard that her asshole is like this big around. [makes a hole with her hands, thumb touching thumb, the other fingers touching their counterparts on the other hand] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35492,Wendy,"Oh, hey Bebe. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut. "

7,14,Raisins,42078,Wendy,"Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him. "

8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45941,Wendy,Who's Paris Hilton? 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45946,Wendy,I don't get it. What's she do? 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45948,Wendy,...But what does she do? 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45950,Wendy,[annoyed] What does she do?! 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45958,Wendy,"You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton? "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45960,Wendy,But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender! 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45973,Wendy,"Hey, Jessie [the blonde], Hey, Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45975,Wendy,"Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum? "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,45978,Wendy,What?! 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46013,Wendy,"Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46015,Wendy,"It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46017,Wendy,"I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46019,Wendy,"[spins around and walks back] Dad, there's a new store at the mall called ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong! "

8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46072,Wendy,"Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46074,Wendy,I'm a stupid spoiled whore. [her dress is relaxed: blue jeans and turquoise tank top with one strap over the right shoulder. The girls laugh at her reply] 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46079,Wendy,That's okay. 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46081,Wendy,Yes. 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46139,Wendy,"No, I need help. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46141,Wendy,"Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46146,Wendy,"No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46149,Wendy,"Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46151,Wendy,Can you teach me your secret fast? 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46159,Wendy,Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited. 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46211,Wendy,"[approaches Stan and friends, and Mr. Garrison] What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there. "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46223,Wendy,"That's okay, you guys. [Butters and his family are shown next] "
9,9,Marjorine,49219,Wendy,"I know. Let's do ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board."" [the girls approve, then spread out. Isla and Emily light candles and place them on the rug. Bebe turns the lights off, and the girls gather, making a circle around the candles] Who wants to do it first? "
9,9,Marjorine,49222,Wendy,"Light as a feather, stiff as a board. "
9,9,Marjorine,49238,Wendy,I think we went too far with Marjorine. 
9,9,Marjorine,49243,Wendy,"I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school. "
9,9,Marjorine,49248,Wendy,"You're not ugly, Marjorine. "
9,9,Marjorine,49251,Wendy,"Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine? "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49436,Wendy,"Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. [beams at Kyle. Stan looks on, miffed] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49445,Wendy,"No. No, that's my egg. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49447,Wendy,"But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49459,Wendy,[wistfully] I wanna see my egg. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49461,Wendy,[enunciates] I want to see my egg. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49463,Wendy,"Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49465,Wendy,...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49467,Wendy,"Don't let anything happen to it, please. [Stan gets upset and disappears back into the kitchen] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49603,Wendy,"Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51392,Wendy,[skeptically] ...yeah. 
11,14,The List,58332,Wendy,"Of course, Stan. [the other two girls smile] "
11,14,The List,58335,Wendy,This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again. 
11,14,The List,58337,Wendy,Which one? We make lists all the time. 
11,14,The List,58339,Wendy,"[walks off a bit] Well, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was- "
11,14,The List,58341,Wendy,Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's not just something we do flippantly! There's protocol! 
11,14,The List,58343,Wendy,"[thinks for a moment] All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy. "
11,14,The List,58354,Wendy,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we... [glances at Stan] That we reopen last week's list for debate. "
11,14,The List,58358,Wendy,Go ahead. 
11,14,The List,58363,Wendy,He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion. 
11,14,The List,58384,Wendy,"Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something! [Stan gets off the chair and walks up to the desk] Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle. "
11,14,The List,58386,Wendy,"It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. [they look at each other, smiling] "
11,14,The List,58389,Wendy,Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks? 
11,14,The List,58391,Wendy,"I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been- "
11,14,The List,58399,Wendy,"Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Clyde the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one. "
11,14,The List,58401,Wendy,"Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here. [drops the report on the table] We need to remake that list. [the girls look at the list as Wendy returns to Stan] "
11,14,The List,58403,Wendy,"Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in. "
11,14,The List,58406,Wendy,[points at her] You knew! 
11,14,The List,58408,Wendy,So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee! 
11,14,The List,58410,Wendy,[stunned that her best friend was in on this] No. Not Bebe. 
11,14,The List,58413,Wendy,"When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna- "
11,14,The List,58416,Wendy,"I don't think so! [goes up and kicks Lola in the groin, hard, much to Stan's shock] "
11,14,The List,58418,Wendy,"[grabs the folder and runs away] Stan, run! "
11,14,The List,58423,Wendy,What? 
11,14,The List,58437,Wendy,You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity! 
11,14,The List,58439,Wendy,"It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't-[becomes distracted] Oh my God, those are amazing. "
11,14,The List,58441,Wendy,Is that a lace across the top? 
11,14,The List,58444,Wendy,"[remembers why she's there] Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far! "
11,14,The List,58447,Wendy,"It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know. "
11,14,The List,58461,Wendy,"Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. [smiles] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59942,Wendy,"Thanks, Stan. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59968,Wendy,"Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59978,Wendy,What's going on? 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60003,Wendy,Over here. This looks like an office. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60006,Wendy,"I can't get a dial tone. [Kyle listens, then lowers the receiver] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60059,Wendy,They must be negotiating. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60119,Wendy,"Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! [they start to move.] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60163,Wendy,"[leans out] Where are you going, Stan? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60228,Wendy,"Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60235,Wendy,"[looks at Pioneer Village] Hey look. [Butters walks towards the entrance dragging Cartman behind him. Cartman is passed out. Butters drags him over the sidewalk, across the parking lot, and on to the bus. Only then does he let go] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60515,Wendy,"[clears her throat] Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [reads from her notes] Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer. [Cartman tries to contain his laughter, but it comes out anyway. Wendy is mad, but resumes her report.] An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- [Cartman again tries to contain his laughter] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60517,Wendy,Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60520,Wendy,"This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60523,Wendy,Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60526,Wendy,"[irritated] No, you aren't! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60530,Wendy,What is your problem? Breast cancer isn't funny. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60532,Wendy,[points to him] You'd better shut up [lowers her right arm] or I'll make you shut up! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60534,Wendy,I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60536,Wendy,"That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60538,Wendy,You think you're tough? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60540,Wendy,I'll smack the shit out of you! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60542,Wendy,After school! We fight after school! You got that?! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60544,Wendy,That's right! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60546,Wendy,"As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60548,Wendy,You're gonna [jabs at the floor for emphasis] fucking die! [turns and walks away. Cartman strikes a few more poses] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60569,Wendy,What?! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60571,Wendy,What? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60573,Wendy,"If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60575,Wendy,"No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60577,Wendy,"Yes, you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60579,Wendy,I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60581,Wendy,Get away from me! [walks away] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60593,Wendy,What?! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60595,Wendy,You really think that's gonna work on me?! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60597,Wendy,You can't bribe your way out of this! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60599,Wendy,"No, you don't. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60601,Wendy,"You don't get it, asshole! [shoves him back a bit] There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60603,Wendy,That's right. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60605,Wendy,"Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60607,Wendy,You fucking suck so hard! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60609,Wendy,What are you doing?! [Cartman takes off his underwear] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60611,Wendy, Ew! [looks away] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60613,Wendy,Oh my God! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60615,Wendy,No! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60617,Wendy,[opens the door] You are so pathetic! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60659,Wendy,[outside] Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! [walks away. Cartman is truly scared] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60662,Wendy,Yeah? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60664,Wendy,What? [moves her head slightly] No! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60667,Wendy,You don't understand. He said horrible things. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60672,Wendy,"Mom, you don't- "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60674,Wendy,I'm not going to hurt you. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60676,Wendy,"Yes, sir. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60688,Wendy,[stops and looks at him] You know I can't fight you! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60690,Wendy,I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60695,Wendy,I can't! [the school bell rings and she walks towards the building] God damn it! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60706,Wendy,[softly] You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60709,Wendy,Why?! [leaves her seat and walks up to Cartman] Why are you doing this to me?! [grabs him by the collar and shakes him] Why won't you just stop?! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60712,Wendy,God! [Cartman cackles as she leaves] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60715,Wendy,"No, ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60717,Wendy,"Yes, ma'am. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60719,Wendy,Ma'am? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60721,Wendy,[thinks a moment] My... parents said that if I fight- 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60723,Wendy,"[the look of determination appears on her face and she makes her hands into fists] Yes, ma'am! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60739,Wendy,I don't care! [Cartman looks around. Butters gleefully dances in place waiting for the fight to start] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60749,Wendy,[pants and looks back at Mr. Mackey] I'm finished! [gets up and walks away. The girls look at her with astonishment] 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61577,Wendy,"That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. [stands on the bench in place and sings]  Everyone is special in their own way. Move to the beat and let your spirit out! [the girls begin to snap their fingers]   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61622,Wendy," [stands up on the seat of her desk] East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. [some kids begin to snap their fingers]   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61629,Wendy, We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair.   [Stan looks at them both and begins to worry that Bridon might sweep her away] 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61640,Wendy,[looks at him] Hey Stan. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61642,Wendy,What? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61644,Wendy,"Stan, that's ridiculous. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61646,Wendy,I would never leave you for Bridon. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61648,Wendy,"No way. That's stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. [shuts her locker and walks away, kissing Stan on the left cheek. Jimmy arrives two seconds later] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61801,Wendy,"Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61840,Wendy,You gave it up? 
13,2,The Coon,62550,Wendy,[walking by] How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy? 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62874,Wendy,"Hey, Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school? "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62876,Wendy,What day? 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62889,Wendy,"God, they're so stupid. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62938,Wendy,[walks up to Stan] What's going on? 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62952,Wendy,"It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62956,Wendy,Wait a minute. I've got an idea. 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62962,Wendy,"Hey, guys, we have a little surprise for you. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63324,Wendy,And he's not fat at all. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63390,Wendy,"You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64332,Wendy,Leave me alone. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64338,Wendy,Stan! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65304,Wendy,Is what true? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65306,Wendy,I don't have time for this. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65309,Wendy,Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65314,Wendy,"Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! [storms off] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65349,Wendy,"I really don't care, Stan. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65351,Wendy,"I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! [takes up her backpack and storms off] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65395,Wendy,"[opens her window] Hey, what are you doing? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65400,Wendy,"It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65403,Wendy,"Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65405,Wendy,If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65409,Wendy,Sure. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65411,Wendy,Okay. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65413,Wendy,"I don't, I, I have no idea what- "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65419,Wendy,"I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but- "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65424,Wendy,"Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65426,Wendy,"What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65428,Wendy,"I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65430,Wendy,"[gets off her chair and walks around a bit] Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65432,Wendy,"No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65436,Wendy,"And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65442,Wendy,"No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65444,Wendy,"Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65446,Wendy,James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66571,Wendy,Am I a joke to you? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66573,Wendy,"I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66575,Wendy,"You do have a Facebook page, Stan! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66577,Wendy,"Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66579,Wendy,"You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page, [crosses her arms] we aren't friends! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66581,Wendy,"And you'd better change your relationship status to ""In a relationship""! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66583,Wendy,"By editing your profile under ""basic information""! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66627,Wendy,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."" "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66629,Wendy,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."" What is that supposed to mean?! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66631,Wendy,That's what Susan92 wrote on your Facebook wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! [walks off angrily] 
14,10,Insheeption,68186,Wendy,"Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called ""hoarding."" People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore. "
14,10,Insheeption,68188,Wendy,[sighs] Stan? We need to talk about your locker. 
14,10,Insheeption,68190,Wendy,[turns away] Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem. 
14,10,Insheeption,68192,Wendy,[turns back] It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker. 
14,10,Insheeption,68194,Wendy,"No, Stan, it's called ""hoarding""! And if you don't get help, I don't know how much longer I could be with you! "
14,10,Insheeption,68196,Wendy,Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away? 
14,10,Insheeption,68198,Wendy,"[wipes a tear from her eye] Okay. [puts a hand on his shoulder] I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan. "
14,10,Insheeption,68521,Wendy,"Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70320,Wendy,Thank God. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71180,Wendy,This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71220,Wendy,Hey Kyle? [immediately he knows what she's going to ask] Have you heard anything at all from Stan? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71222,Wendy,I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71226,Wendy,"Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could- "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71742,Wendy,"You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71745,Wendy,Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! [Stan leans away a bit] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71747,Wendy,"So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! [Stan stays silent] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71752,Wendy,Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. [Butters laughs at Wendy's wisecrack in a weird way] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71761,Wendy,Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know. 
15,12,1%,72241,Wendy,"We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74490,Wendy,"Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. [the other girls chime in, showing their support. The camera pulls back a bit, and Cartman is shown eavesdropping just outside a basement window] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74494,Wendy,"Oh, you mean Kyle? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74841,Wendy,"[to Butters' left] Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76709,Wendy,[reading from her yellow index cards] Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need- 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76711,Wendy,[returns to her report] Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76713,Wendy,"[returns to her report, with her voice clearly getting more annoyed and explicit] The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from- "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76715,Wendy,"Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76717,Wendy,"Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please? [no reaction - he's rather engrossed in the book he's reading] Mr. Garrison?! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76719,Wendy,"[extremely annoyed, goes to her seat] Ugh, Jesus! [Peter walks up and takes her place] "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76750,Wendy,This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76865,Wendy,I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents- 
17,10,The Hobbit,78791,Wendy,"Cheer Squad roll call! [each cheerleader steps forward, announces her name, and steps back] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78803,Wendy,"You guys, stop it! Okay, Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78805,Wendy,What? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78807,Wendy,"See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78811,Wendy,"But, Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78813,Wendy,"Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78827,Wendy,[grabs his locker door and slams it shut] What the fuck is your problem?! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78829,Wendy,Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78831,Wendy,Yeah! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78833,Wendy,Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78835,Wendy,"She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78837,Wendy,What?! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78839,Wendy,"[grabs the poster] This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78841,Wendy,"Look it up, stupid! [crushes the poster into a wad] In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit! [throws the wadded-up poster to the floor and walks away. As Butters reaches for the poster, Wendy turns around] You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! [turns around and goes around the corner. Butters unwads the poster] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78844,Wendy,"[noticing Butters] Oh, good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78846,Wendy,...Are you serious? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78848,Wendy,That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78850,Wendy,"Right, but she's not in real life. She's a hobbit. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78853,Wendy,"I'm not ""jel"", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78861,Wendy,"Butters. Butters, come here for a sec. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78863,Wendy,"Butters, will you please let me show you something, so we can put this behind us? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78865,Wendy,"I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78867,Wendy,"Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides [she trims them down a bit]. We select the eyes [makes the glasses more rectangular and shorter, and adds eye makeup], make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin [the freckles go], lengthen the neck [moves the head up], add more to the hair [gives Lisa longer, wavy hair], select the lips and make them fuller [removes the harelip], take out any puffiness on the skin [reduces the cheeks] here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin [this gives Lisa hips], streamline the shoulders [making the arms thinner in the process], put highlights in the eyes [gives her a nose], and, there. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78869,Wendy,Do you see what I'm talking about? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78871,Wendy,That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere. 
17,10,The Hobbit,78873,Wendy,What? What do you mean? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78875,Wendy,Butters! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78894,Wendy,Excuse me! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78896,Wendy,Why would I be jel? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78898,Wendy,She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78900,Wendy,"Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! [just then, Lisa and Clyde walk past her, but she doesn't see this. Jimmy does, though.] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78903,Wendy,"[looks and quickly assesses the situation] I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78905,Wendy,"I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78910,Wendy,"Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that- "
17,10,The Hobbit,78912,Wendy,Jelly school? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78914,Wendy,"Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78916,Wendy,"Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78918,Wendy,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78928,Wendy,"Cheer Squad roll call! [each cheerleader steps forward, announces her name, and steps back] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78936,Wendy,"And I'm your captain, Wendy! [silence. One kindergartner comes out of the bleachers with a picture of Lisa and has Lisa sign it. More cheers, and Lisa waves at the audience] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78940,Wendy,"I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78942,Wendy,"Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! [turns left and walks away] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78961,Wendy,[curt] What? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78963,Wendy,"So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78965,Wendy,Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs. 
17,10,The Hobbit,78967,Wendy,"Yeah. [begins to point out other kids' defects] And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders. [The cheerleaders come into view and approach Wendy and Stan. Neither of them notices] The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nichole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair. [Mr. Mackey walks in on the rant] And Heidi Turner's butt is flat! [Wendy turns to leave, but runs into the cheerleaders and Mr. Mackey] Oh God damn it! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78970,Wendy,Ugh! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78982,Wendy,[slowly steps forward and speaks softly] Wendy. 
17,10,The Hobbit,78990,Wendy,"Let's just get back to cheering, okay?! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78996,Wendy,"See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far! [leaves] And if society won't fix it, I will! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78998,Wendy,[stops just outside the gym] Something that should have been done a long time ago! [walks away] 
17,10,The Hobbit,79003,Wendy,Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it. 
17,10,The Hobbit,79005,Wendy,...Nooo. 
17,10,The Hobbit,79007,Wendy,"[thinks about it] Not lately, no. "
17,10,The Hobbit,79009,Wendy,NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images! 
17,10,The Hobbit,79012,Wendy,"That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts! "
17,10,The Hobbit,79014,Wendy,"That's fine! [leaves her seat] People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me! "
17,10,The Hobbit,79016,Wendy,Agh! What do you want? 
17,10,The Hobbit,79018,Wendy,"Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly. "
17,10,The Hobbit,79020,Wendy,"No no, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79297,Wendy,You're... back? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79299,Wendy,"[sarcastic] Oh wow, I'm shocked. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79301,Wendy,"You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be ""free to chase your dreams"". "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79303,Wendy,"Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be [does air quotes] ""dripping in bitches""?! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79305,Wendy,"I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! [turns around and walks away] "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79536,Wendy,"Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79538,Wendy,So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79540,Wendy,"You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79543,Wendy,"Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79545,Wendy,Thought so. [hangs up. Stan lets his head fall on the table] 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79586,Wendy,"Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79588,Wendy,"You're so transparent, Stan. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79590,Wendy,"You wanna dance? [he looks back at her, smiles, and goes to dance with her.] "
18,3,The Cissy,79607,Wendy,What the hell do you think you're doing? 
18,3,The Cissy,79609,Wendy,This is the girls' bathroom! 
18,3,The Cissy,79611,Wendy,What?! 
18,3,The Cissy,79613,Wendy,Get out of here! 
18,3,The Cissy,79616,Wendy,Cartman is using our bathroom! 
18,3,The Cissy,79668,Wendy,"Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is- "
18,3,The Cissy,79676,Wendy,That isn't fair! 
18,3,The Cissy,79733,Wendy,"Hey guys. [all look and stare. Wendy walks down the hallway dressed as her male persona, Wendyl, in t-shirt and vest, purple pants, hair pinned back.] "
18,3,The Cissy,79735,Wendy,How's it hanging'? 
18,3,The Cissy,79741,Wendy,It's cool. I'll wait. 
18,8,Cock Magic,80976,Wendy,"Yeah, I heard the girls' volleyball team won by like 20 points. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80978,Wendy,Yeah. You should show your support too sometime. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81128,Wendy,"[gets up and goes to the front of the class. Stan is immediately stunned] Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. [goes back to her seat] "
18,9,REHASH,81361,Wendy,Hi everybody. I love you! 
18,9,REHASH,81363,Wendy,"So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy?? [the audience cheers in agreement] Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! [Instead of Cartman himself appearing on the couch, Cartman's commenter window pops up - he's doing this via satellite] "
18,9,REHASH,81365,Wendy,So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO? 
18,9,REHASH,81367,Wendy,And why do you think young people-? 
18,9,REHASH,81369,Wendy,...Why do you think young people are responding to this? [Cartman mocks the question by asking it back in nonsense syllables] I'm asking you a question! [Cartman continues with the nonsense replies] 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82559,Wendy,"Come on, Liza, I'll introduce you to the girls. "
19,5,Safe Space,82812,Wendy,Is this a joke? 
19,5,Safe Space,82815,Wendy,I'm not doing it. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83014,Wendy,"Hey, guys. As you know, we have several new students here at South Park Elementary. We have been getting to know some of the Asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called ""yaoi."" [On the projection screen, the text reads ""YAOI"" and below it, in Japanese text, ""BOIZU RABU"" (Boys Love), with a pink platycodon in the background. Oriental music begins to play as Wendy cycles through yaoi images on the screen.] Yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon. The art tries to show that all love is magical, like in Lisa Akimoto's piece, ""Tweek and Craig - Forbidden Love."" [Tweek and Craig in a French kiss.] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83017,Wendy,"Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical with ""Craig and Tweek: Moonlight Dance."" [Tweek wears a pink bow in his hair and is wrapped in a pink ribbon while Craig stands behind him looking down at his face.] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83020,Wendy,"In yaoi art, the seme, or ""top"", is usually dominating the uke, or ""bottom"", as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's ""Boizu Rabu."" [Craig reaching down into Tweek's briefs as Tweek reaches up to stroke Craig's head] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83022,Wendy,But yaoi can branch out to other things as well... 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83024,Wendy,"...as we see here in ""Lily, Frog, Tweek and Craig."" [Tweek is on his back with only an unbutton shirt and looking away, while Craig is on top of him pinning him down and looking into his eyes. Above them is a lily flower and frog.] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83213,Wendy,"[steps forward to Tweek's spot] Tweek. [glares at Craig, then follows Tweek concerned. Craig looks at the other kids, who glare at him and walk away. The Asian girls even leave their drawing tools behind] "
20,1,Member Berries,84381,Wendy,"It is him, it's completely obvious, and nobody is doing anything about it! "
20,1,Member Berries,84403,Wendy,I'm not funny. 
20,1,Member Berries,84405,Wendy,I don't feel like being funny right now. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84653,Wendy,It has to be swift and serious. We have to make a statement. The girls in South Park aren't going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore! 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84808,Wendy,Oh my God...I don't know if I can go through with this. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85093,Wendy,[smiles at Stan] 
20,4,Wieners Out,85124,Wendy,They took their wieners out! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85126,Wendy,This was an attack on us. This is exactly why we sat out the National Anthem in the first place! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85136,Wendy,[runs away from the rally] 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85292,Wendy,He is stupid! Look at him! 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85301,Wendy,Heidi?! 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85508,Wendy,['How is this our fault?! At least we actually did the work! ']
21,7,Doubling Down,88670,Wendy,"What do you want, Kyle? "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88841,Wendy,"Is it just me, or are things around here getting worse and worse? "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88845,Wendy,"People change. They say you become more and more like the person you're with, and I guess it's true with Heidi. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88851,Wendy,"Heidi, are you okay? It's just... you look... "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88853,Wendy,"Ngh, you know, y-you just look- "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88910,Wendy,"It's... not exactly like being a slave, Heidi. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88919,Wendy,"[to Theresa, about Heidi] Just don't even respond to her. Just ignore her. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89113,Wendy,Watching Heidi get her bitch-ass kicked! 
22,5,The Scoots,90732,Wendy,You wanna trick or treat with us? Why? 
22,5,The Scoots,90747,Wendy,"Oh, you jerks found out the girls are all trick or treating on e-scooters, and you stole our idea! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92784,Wendy,We asked for healthier options and to sometimes have food for those of us who don't eat red meat. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92851,Wendy,"Everyone? Everyone, can I have your attention, please? [the students all stop eating and look at her] Look, guys. We're supposed to be the young generation, right? We're the ones upset about the world our parents left us. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92853,Wendy,The millions and millions of cows and pigs and chickens that we harvest every year [Cartman begins to tremble in anger] are a huge reason for climate change. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92856,Wendy,"Without sustainable and ethical food choices now, we're proving to be no d- "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94379,Wendy,Hello. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95401,Wendy,"Mr. Principal sir, can we please wear our pajamas on pajama day? "
25,1,Pajama Day,95403,Wendy,"Mr. Principal, we really didn't do anything wrong. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95446,Wendy,"[startled] Oh, fuck! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95448,Wendy,Yes? 
25,1,Pajama Day,95450,Wendy,Sir? 
25,1,Pajama Day,95452,Wendy,"Well, Mr. principal, if you just– "
25,1,Pajama Day,95474,Wendy,We all have to be on the same page here. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95480,Wendy,"We apologize. [the boys all look at her, offended] You guys want a chance to save pajama day? Then join us in telling Mr. Garrison we're all sorry. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95482,Wendy,"At school tomorrow, we all tell Mr. Garrison he was right and that we've been terrible students. That we weren't listening and that he deserves to be angry with us. We tell him how much we care and that we want to see him more as a human being than just a teacher. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95485,Wendy,We just have to be brave. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95500,Wendy,"Remember... no matter how angry he is, tell him he's right. [the bell rings; Mr. Garrison enters the classroom excitedly] "
25,1,Pajama Day,95509,Wendy,"""This is..."" "
25,1,Pajama Day,95551,Wendy,"[she enters] You wanted to see me, sir? "
25,1,Pajama Day,95553,Wendy,"Sir, maybe people won't lose respect for you if you change your mind. Saying you were wrong is sometimes the strongest thing you can do. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95555,Wendy,Then we can't put on our pajamas. Out of principle. The kids will be okay. At least we still have opposite day to look forward to. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95557,Wendy,I said we'll be okay. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95559,Wendy,It's always the second Friday in March. 
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96035,Wendy,"We're not worried about that, we're all worried about Putin. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97696,Wendy,Clyde wrote that? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97701,Wendy,No... every time I send Stan a text he just responds with a thumbs-up emoji. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97711,Wendy,"Hey, Stan... Is there a time we could talk today? I'm feeling a little insecure about some things... "
26,4,Deep Learning,97734,Wendy,"Hey, Stan, I didn't get it yet. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97736,Wendy,"You asked me if I wanted a bedtime story about frogs, or a song about swans. I said a bedtime story! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97738,Wendy,"Okay, bye! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97808,Wendy,"This place is good, right? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97810,Wendy,"Well, I know it's not much, but I just wanted to take you out somewhere to say thanks, Stan. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97812,Wendy,For stepping up and working on communication when I asked you to. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97814,Wendy,"The things we've talked about, Stan, it's really helping me. I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. I've been so scared for so long to tell anyone what happened to me when I was six. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97816,Wendy,(Starts tearing up) And... everything you had to say about it was just right. It really changed the way I think about the whole thing. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97818,Wendy,"And when you said the same thing happened to you, I- I couldn't believe it. Were you at home when it happened? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97820,Wendy,But you're right. We can't dwell on those things. You're right about a lot of stuff. There was just that one thing I don't understand... about the boating accident in Switzerland? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97822,Wendy,I thought you said it was great. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97824,Wendy,(Blinks back tears) But how did it cause the thing with your cousin? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97826,Wendy,It's a little after four. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97828,Wendy,"No, no, no, that's totally okay. I gotta get going, too. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97831,Wendy,"Thank you so much, Stan. Thank you for being the only real thing in my life. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97922,Wendy,What is going on? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97927,Wendy,No I haven’t. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97929,Wendy,I write my own essays. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97952,Wendy,That's right! 
26,4,Deep Learning,97960,Wendy,"Thanks for saving me, Stan! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97966,Wendy,"Yeah, but, I'm still really not sure what just happened. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97968,Wendy,"Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Stan. I love you. "
