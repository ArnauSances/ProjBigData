3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19546,Craig,"That's the point, buttpipe. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19568,Craig,"[""-becoming of me?""] Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid! [Mark enters and stands next to Kyle] Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! [""Ride the tiger.""] "

4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26942,Craig,"[stops just short of the line] This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line. "

4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26949,Craig,"It's Spaceman Craig. [walks away slowly, deliberately, making sci-fi sound effects as he walks. Linda and her husband look at each other baffled. They then walk forward...] "

6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36508,Craig,It could hold a mental spell of some kind. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36532,Craig,There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36534,Craig,"Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. [all the boys begin to chatter, nominating who should return the video] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36535,Craig,You're too young. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36545,Craig,Only the six of us are to go?

8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42849,Craig,"At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42851,Craig,"So, [unsheathes his sword] how would you ninjas like to do battle? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42853,Craig,You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! [Clyde crosses his kamas against each other]

8,6,The Jeffersons,44268,Craig,[in a monotone voice] No way.

8,11,Quest for Ratings,45711,Craig,"[on tape, as the name of the show is displayed] Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. [the video goes on to show close-ups of dogs and cats.] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45731,Craig,[sees the other boys and addresses them] Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45733,Craig,"Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45735,Craig,[throws the gesture back at Stan] This much more than you had! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45737,Craig,"Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! [the other kids cheer and the waiter opens the lounge. The kids pour into place, including Kenny.] "

9,5,The Losing Edge,47979,Craig,All the other teams are worse than us. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48139,Craig,But who? 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48148,Craig,He's perfect. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48302,Craig,"Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you? "
9,9,Marjorine,49084,Craig,What? 
9,9,Marjorine,49118,Craig,I... don't believe it. 
9,9,Marjorine,49126,Craig,Let's go take it! 
9,9,Marjorine,49284,Craig,He got it! He got the device! [the boys surround Butters] 
9,9,Marjorine,49315,Craig,I wanna use it. 
9,9,Marjorine,49321,Craig,"You shut up, asshole. "
9,9,Marjorine,49327,Craig,Maybe we should take it so someplace safer. 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49710,Craig,You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50213,Craig,"Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50215,Craig,Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50217,Craig,...So it's true. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50266,Craig,That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51076,Craig,"Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away! "
10,7,Tsst,52543,Craig,...But I hate you. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52730,Craig,He killed my character right in the middle of a quest! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52755,Craig,Got it. 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54779,Craig,"...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55198,Craig,[leaves the curtain and puts on his hat] I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! [walks past the rest of the class] 
11,3,Lice Capades,55266,Craig,"With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? [Clyde looks apprehensive, and Mrs. Garrison notices] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55279,Craig,How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55295,Craig,"Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55341,Craig,Yeah. That's true. 
11,3,Lice Capades,55356,Craig,"You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55373,Craig,"Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! [points to the sock in his right hand] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55407,Craig,"All right, let's do this! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55413,Craig,He had cooties and he lied about it! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55423,Craig,I thought I was the only one. 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56703,Craig,"[in admiration] He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say ""shitballs"" to the principal I'd be sooo happy. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56714,Craig,"If I could say ""asspussy"" to the counselor I would be sooo happy. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56728,Craig,"[getting miserable] If I could yell ""tampon dickshit"" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56811,Craig,"If I could say ""titty sprinkles"" on national television I would be sooo happy. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56901,Craig,"[walks up to Thomas] Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56903,Craig,"Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57185,Craig,No way. 
11,10,Imaginationland,57193,Craig,Dude. 
11,10,Imaginationland,57348,Craig,He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57969,Craig,"Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. [Randy stands there a few seconds, disappointed that the boys aren't interested. He takes off the guitar, leans it against the amplifier, and walks away.] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58067,Craig,"Dude, this game rules. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58133,Craig,"Dude, what's the matter with him? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58136,Craig,"Oh man, I can't watch this. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58192,Craig,How was that cheating! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58200,Craig,They did it! 
11,14,The List,58211,Craig,So who do they say is the cutest? 
11,14,The List,58220,Craig,You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list! 
11,14,The List,58222,Craig,You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom? 
11,14,The List,58255,Craig,"We got the list from the girls! [the other boys take pursuit: Stan, Tolkien, Jimmy, Clyde, Tweek, Bill, and two others. Two sixth graders and some kindergartners watch from the far end of the hall] "
11,14,The List,58260,Craig,"Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I? "
11,14,The List,58268,Craig,"Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! [he's #12 while Cartman is #15] "
11,14,The List,58321,Craig,Could somebody toss the football back? It's over there next to the ugly kids. [the ugly kids just watch quietly. Kyle is more and more depressed] 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59189,Craig,Nothing! [everyone laughs harder and looks at Ike.] 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60108,Craig,[observes] These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. [another worker is tied up and put on the chair as the smithy's body is dragged away] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60588,Craig,"Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60649,Craig,Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60653,Craig,"Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60737,Craig,"All right, let's DO IT! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60757,Craig,"No, it's true. We've always hated you. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60760,Craig, [confused] What? 
12,10,Pandemic,60816,Craig,...Fine. 
12,10,Pandemic,60818,Craig,...Yeah. 
12,10,Pandemic,60822,Craig,What do you guys want? 
12,10,Pandemic,60825,Craig,You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots? 
12,10,Pandemic,60828,Craig,[assessing the situation] You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars. 
12,10,Pandemic,60830,Craig,[turns right and walks past Cartman] I'll go get the money. [the boys grin. Stan and Kenny high-five each other.] 
12,10,Pandemic,60884,Craig,"""Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole."" [some alarms go off for a few seconds, then fall silent as Chertoff appears above the crowd with a blond translator to his left] "
12,10,Pandemic,60955,Craig,"Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you? [the other boys look at each other] Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys. "
12,10,Pandemic,60960,Craig,"Can we please just go home, sir? "
12,10,Pandemic,60992,Craig,"Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said ""Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."" [no answer] No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes. "
12,10,Pandemic,60995,Craig,[testing] I'm being a dick? 
12,10,Pandemic,60997,Craig,"You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick? "
12,10,Pandemic,61000,Craig,That would be great. Thank you. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61044,Craig,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday. [a picture of him, his family, and a grandmother standing behind a cake. Ten candles are on the cake. Balloons are all around and a ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" banner is above them] My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars. [a picture of that is shown] I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house [a shot of the four boys in Craig's living room] and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band. [a shot of the newly-formed band, the Llama Brothers] They promised I would double my money in one afternoon. [soldiers swoop in and apprehend them] But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami. [the camp is shown, followed by the five boys sitting in the interrogation room] We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru. [a shot of a DHS cargo plane with the boys sitting on the ground near it.] And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. [he sits on one suitcase, Kenny on another. The whole group is in a mountainous region of Peru] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61079,Craig,"Oh, that's awesome. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61083,Craig,This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61121,Craig,"That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61124,Craig,Stuff just happens. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61126,Craig,You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61128,Craig,You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61155,Craig,"""Let's see what's in there."" That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say ""Let's see what's in there."" "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61168,Craig,What? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61171,Craig,I have no idea. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61173,Craig,I don't know. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61221,Craig,No. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61223,Craig,I'm not following you guys any more. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61225,Craig,Why? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61227,Craig,"Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because ""that's just the way it is."" "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61229,Craig,I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61231,Craig,"It's easy. Watch. [turns around and walks back out the way they came in. He makes his way back to the temple's entrance, and the boys follow him] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61234,Craig,No. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61236,Craig,...Nope. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61238,Craig,"Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61266,Craig,I didn't say anything. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61272,Craig,"Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? [walks onto a square with a pattern on it. The circle in the center of the pattern lights up and begins to rotate up and out. Two stone slabs jut out from the pillar. The golden idol's eyes light up. A beam of light goes from the idol's staff to one of the slabs, and two beams of lightning come out of Craig's eyes and strike the guinea pirate] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61274,Craig,"Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61277,Craig,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released, [a shot of that is shown; happy pan flute musicians] and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains. [shots from all over are shown, specifically South Park and New York City: pan flute bands are driving the guinea creatures away] Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed. [shots of the cleanup are shown. The Marshes are among the rescued] All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61279,Craig,"The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days. [the guinea pirate is taken to the Washington D.C. State Penitentiary strapped down to a flatbed truck. Next, a shot of Paris is shown: a Peruvian flute band plays at the Champs Elysées] And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security. [Top Official 1 and Official 3 drop him off and smile at the joyful parents] My parents were sooo happy. [a shot of Craig looking at himself in the mirror, reflecting on the events surrounding his trip to Peru] I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us. [a shot of Craig in bed, just after bedtime] We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. [a shot of the boys dressed as Mariachis standing at Craig's front porch talking to him; he slams the door in their faces.] "

13,5,Fishsticks,63244,Craig,Then just give him half. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63246,Craig,"I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63248,Craig,"Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63250,Craig,Just give him half. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64176,Craig,That's right. [steps back and hits the ball again. The ball wraps around the pole and hits Butters on the face again. Cartman laughs]

15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71435,Craig,"Hey. Hey, I got one. [the other get quiet] Why do girls wear makeup and perfume? "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71437,Craig,'Cause they're ugly and they stink. [most of the other boys laugh] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71467,Craig,Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not. 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71473,Craig,Game on! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71645,Craig,"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71727,Craig,"Hey, here's a post about Tolkien: ""Tolkien Black's Private Gym Photos"" [laughs] "

15,10,Bass to Mouth,71754,Craig,[reading off his iPhone] It's not somebody in this room. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71756,Craig,"Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: ""Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."" [laughs] Yeah. Hey wait, that's me. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71758,Craig,Huh? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71765,Craig,It's a rat! [the gerbil noticed them and runs away] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71813,Craig,There's no telling. It could be about any of us. [Stan gets off the computer and notices something happening above him as a blinding light appears. The light softens to reveal the Catatafish] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71870,Craig,Nothing broke on the Web site yet.

16,13,A Scause For Applause,75982,Craig,"Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76051,Craig,"It just looked like you cut it off, that's all. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76138,Craig,"We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. [the kids raise their arms to prove it] "

17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76828,Craig,It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76861,Craig,"I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions! "

17,7,Black Friday,78119,Craig,I thought we were getting Playstation 4's. 
17,7,Black Friday,78128,Craig,Right. Let's all get PS4s. 
17,7,Black Friday,78132,Craig,[angrily] That's exactly how XBox people are!

19,6,Tweek x Craig,83042,Craig,Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83044,Craig,But we aren't! I'm not! 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83051,Craig,But I'm not gay! 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83057,Craig,"No, you may not! "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83121,Craig,"Got a fuckin' problem, man?! [pushes Tweek back] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83123,Craig,I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!

19,6,Tweek x Craig,83159,Craig,Is Tweek home? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83161,Craig,"No, thank you, I just want to see Tweek. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83165,Craig,"Hey dude. [this makes Tweek spit out his coffee, and he gets off his chair] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83167,Craig,"Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83169,Craig,"Me too, dude! But there's something we can do. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83171,Craig,We have to come out and say we're gay. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83173,Craig,"Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83175,Craig,"You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83177,Craig,"You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83193,Craig,"Hey, Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work. [the smiles vanish] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83195,Craig,"I'm sorry, Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore. [turns to face the gathering crowd of kids] Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83197,Craig,It's just that people are different. That's all. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83199,Craig,"What? What are you, what are you talking about? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83201,Craig,"Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83203,Craig,"No. [tries to get Tweek back on track] Uh, look, we both know this is for the better. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83205,Craig,"Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83207,Craig,"[tries again] You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83209,Craig,This wasn't part of the plan! 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83214,Craig,"Dude, seriously? Seriously? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83240,Craig,What do you want? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83242,Craig,"Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you! "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83244,Craig,"You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83246,Craig,Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks! 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83248,Craig,I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else. 
20,1,Member Berries,84517,Craig,I wanna see. 
20,1,Member Berries,84520,Craig,We didn't do it. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84664,Craig,We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop! 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84678,Craig,How would we ever get away with it? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84762,Craig,Let's just get it over with! [Walks up to Cartman] 
20,3,The Damned,84852,Craig,We did what we had to do.

21,2,Put It Down,87236,Craig,What am I supposed to do? 
21,2,Put It Down,87238,Craig,He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional. 
21,2,Put It Down,87253,Craig,[approaches] Tweek. 
21,2,Put It Down,87255,Craig,"Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down. "
21,2,Put It Down,87257,Craig,"[calmly] We're not all gonna die, you're overreacting. Everything's fine, okay? "
21,2,Put It Down,87259,Craig,Tweek- 
21,2,Put It Down,87261,Craig,"Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter? "
21,2,Put It Down,87263,Craig,"Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans. "
21,2,Put It Down,87265,Craig,"Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans? "
21,2,Put It Down,87267,Craig,"It will make you feel better, babe. "
21,2,Put It Down,87269,Craig,"I don't know, like... make some croissants or something? "
21,2,Put It Down,87271,Craig,"Well, what do you know how to make? "
21,2,Put It Down,87273,Craig,"All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey. "
21,2,Put It Down,87308,Craig,"[walks into the kitchen just in time] Tweek, calm down. "
21,2,Put It Down,87310,Craig,"Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better. "
21,2,Put It Down,87312,Craig,[whips something out of his jacket pocket and shows him] It's a fidget spinner. It's supposed to help with anxiety. [spins it on his finger] See? 
21,2,Put It Down,87376,Craig,[started] Ugh. Wuh. [rubs his eyes and sees who woke him] Hey Tweek. 
21,2,Put It Down,87378,Craig,"What time is it, dude? "
21,2,Put It Down,87380,Craig,"""North Korea doesn't have the balls to attack Tweek. They have little tiny rice balls."" "
21,2,Put It Down,87384,Craig,You've gotta calm down. 
21,2,Put It Down,87386,Craig,"[at the same time] Tweek. Tweek. Tweek! [calms down, but is still shaking]' Let's think this through logically. North Korea isn't going to attack anyone, okay? They're not going to start a war they can't win. Okay? "
21,2,Put It Down,87388,Craig,Tweek! You have to stop thinking about it. Tell you what. We're gonna go somewhere fun and make you feel better. 
21,2,Put It Down,87407,Craig,"Okay, babe, what do you want to ride first? "
21,2,Put It Down,87409,Craig,"We're gonna get your mind off politics and have some fun. Now, what's your favorite ride? "
21,2,Put It Down,87412,Craig,"Isn't this lovely, Tweek? Just look at that view! "
21,2,Put It Down,87414,Craig,"Oh, come on. "
21,2,Put It Down,87416,Craig,"Tweek! Tweek, use your brain! North Korea isn't going to attack an amusement park. You're safer here than anywhere. "
21,2,Put It Down,87424,Craig,It's probably nothing. Everything's fine. 
21,2,Put It Down,87426,Craig,I'm trying to make you feel better. 
21,2,Put It Down,87428,Craig,"Okay, but think about that. That actually doesn't make any sense. "
21,2,Put It Down,87430,Craig,"Tweek, honey, all week you've been freaking out, and I've been the one forced to deal with it! "
21,2,Put It Down,87432,Craig,"Tweek, North Korea isn't bombing anyone. [Tweek turns away and tugs at his hair] They would lose the support of China, and that would mean- "
21,2,Put It Down,87434,Craig,"Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually in control of my goddamn emotions, you baby! [stops himself for a few seconds] Oh, see? Now you made me lose control of my emotions. [turns left and walks away] God dammit! [Tweek watches him leave, then grunts louder and louder until it's a full scream] "
21,2,Put It Down,87437,Craig,[a bit depressed] How should I know? 
21,2,Put It Down,87439,Craig,"Look guys, Tweek doesn't want help, okay? He just wants to overreact. "
21,2,Put It Down,87452,Craig,"[runs into the bedroom] Tweek, what's going on?? "
