6,9,Free Hat,35211,Tweek,Huh uh. 
6,9,Free Hat,35213,Tweek,Guh huh huh! [walks off and returns with a stool. He climbs up on it and gets the reel canister. The door opens behind the boys and the lights go on]

6,9,Free Hat,35295,Tweek,[fixes his aim on his target] That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends. 
6,9,Free Hat,35297,Tweek,Except for Cartman - you can keep him. 
6,9,Free Hat,35300,Tweek,Then your premiere has no movie! 
6,9,Free Hat,35316,Tweek,"Ah, what?! "
6,9,Free Hat,35339,Tweek,Oh my God! 
6,9,Free Hat,35344,Tweek,But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?

6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35805,Tweek,"Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35807,Tweek,It isn't? 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35816,Tweek,"I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35818,Tweek,I'll... try.
