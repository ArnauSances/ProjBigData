1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,108,Kyle,We have to do something! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,114,Kyle,What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Stan farts.] You farted. [They laugh.] 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,138,Kyle,"[Whispering.] Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"" "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,140,Kyle,"[His voice is rising to an audible level.] ""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?"" "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,143,Kyle,"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,145,Kyle,"No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Silence.] It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,147,Kyle,"[Kyle walks up to Mr. Garrison's desk.] Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,149,Kyle,"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,151,Kyle,"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,154,Kyle,[frustrated] Damn it! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,160,Kyle,"Damn, Cartman! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,162,Kyle,"Dude, he's farting fire! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,181,Kyle,"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,194,Kyle,"Dude, what does the note say? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,197,Kyle,Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,202,Kyle,"Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,207,Kyle,Bad. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,209,Kyle,"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,221,Kyle,No! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,227,Kyle,Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,233,Kyle,That was cool! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,239,Kyle,"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,251,Kyle,"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,257,Kyle,He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,261,Kyle,Hey! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,263,Kyle,If you Visitors can hear me- 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,266,Kyle,"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,270,Kyle,Give me back my brother! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,273,Kyle,You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,275,Kyle,"Damn it, we were so close! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,283,Kyle,"Now do you believe us, Cartman? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,285,Kyle,"Cartman, they killed Kenny! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,291,Kyle,"He's dead, Cartman! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,294,Kyle,"Go on and go home, you fat chicken! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,296,Kyle,"You're all I have left, Stan. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,298,Kyle,"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,302,Kyle,Rats. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,326,Kyle,"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,332,Kyle,"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,337,Kyle,"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,339,Kyle,Just make sweet love down by the fire. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,359,Kyle,...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,361,Kyle,Why? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,363,Kyle,"Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. [He moves out.] "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,379,Kyle,"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,391,Kyle,How come the Visitors aren't coming for him? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,395,Kyle,"Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,397,Kyle,Sure you do! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,401,Kyle,"Fart, damn you! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,407,Kyle,"Whoa, look at that. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,422,Kyle,"Uh, uh... "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,424,Kyle,"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,426,Kyle,"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,428,Kyle,Did it work? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,430,Kyle,"Hey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,432,Kyle,You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,436,Kyle,"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,441,Kyle,"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,448,Kyle,Ike! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,451,Kyle,Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,460,Kyle,"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,468,Kyle,"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. [They leave.] "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,489,Kyle,"Yeah, we're running out of friends. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,500,Kyle,"Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,506,Kyle,"Cartman, you do have pinkeye! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,509,Kyle,"Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,512,Kyle,Nobody hates rainbows. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,517,Kyle,Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,521,Kyle,"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,534,Kyle,"Wow, what did you write about Cartman? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,537,Kyle,What was your paper about Wendy? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,544,Kyle,Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,572,Kyle,"Wow, are you gonna do it? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,666,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,671,Kyle,"Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,677,Kyle,"Bulk up to what, fat-ass? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,726,Kyle,"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,729,Kyle,"You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,731,Kyle,"Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"" "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,782,Kyle,I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,784,Kyle,Stop who? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,793,Kyle,"Uh oh, we're losing him. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,855,Kyle,"[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,859,Kyle,"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,894,Kyle,"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway. "
1,3,Volcano,908,Kyle,"Ready to go hunting, Cartman? "
1,3,Volcano,923,Kyle,[In a slight falsetto.] Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman. 
1,3,Volcano,937,Kyle,I like chocolate milk. 
1,3,Volcano,952,Kyle,"Wow, that'd be cool. "

1,3,Volcano,1060,Kyle,"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee. "
1,3,Volcano,1070,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody! "
1,3,Volcano,1077,Kyle,Deformed how? 
1,3,Volcano,1080,Kyle,A knife. 
1,3,Volcano,1084,Kyle,"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary! "
1,3,Volcano,1087,Kyle,"Yeah, give me that flashlight. "
1,3,Volcano,1091,Kyle,What is that? 
1,3,Volcano,1094,Kyle,"Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand. "
1,3,Volcano,1103,Kyle,"Stan, Stan, wake up! "
1,3,Volcano,1105,Kyle,I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away. 
1,3,Volcano,1107,Kyle,They're out fishing with Kenny. 
1,3,Volcano,1109,Kyle,"Well Stan, you want to know what I think? "
1,3,Volcano,1151,Kyle,Look!

1,3,Volcano,1210,Kyle,"[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it. "
1,3,Volcano,1222,Kyle,Whoa! 
1,3,Volcano,1226,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! "
1,3,Volcano,1251,Kyle,Oh my God! Look at his leg! 
1,3,Volcano,1263,Kyle,Aaaaah! 
1,3,Volcano,1277,Kyle,"Hey look, Kenny's okay. "
1,3,Volcano,1296,Kyle,"Yeah, make up your mind, dude! "
1,3,Volcano,1305,Kyle,"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1309,Kyle,"Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice. "

1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1347,Kyle,Who's Middle Park? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1384,Kyle,"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog? "

1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1446,Kyle,Did it work? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1478,Kyle,Ooh-la-la. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1486,Kyle,Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1490,Kyle,"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1506,Kyle,What'd he say? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1510,Kyle,"Come on dude, we have to get to practice. "

1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1581,Kyle,You what?! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1613,Kyle,But I never practiced quarterback. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1637,Kyle,"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?! "

1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1846,Kyle,You mean this one? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1848,Kyle,He's my new pet elephant. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1850,Kyle,"I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1852,Kyle,"No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1858,Kyle,"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1861,Kyle,"Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1869,Kyle,Mr. Garrison? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1871,Kyle,"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1873,Kyle,That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1875,Kyle,"They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1880,Kyle,"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1882,Kyle,I'll bet you can't. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1888,Kyle,Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1890,Kyle,We can use Cartman's pig. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1892,Kyle,"We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1921,Kyle,Ready to go Stan? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1923,Kyle,To the Genetical Engineering Ranch. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1924,Kyle,We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1928,Kyle,Why's your sister so mean to you dude? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1934,Kyle,This must be it. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1937,Kyle,"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1939,Kyle,It's just a stupid pig. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1944,Kyle,"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1946,Kyle,"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1951,Kyle,Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1953,Kyle,"No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1960,Kyle,How does that make the world better? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1966,Kyle,"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1968,Kyle,Which song is that? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1975,Kyle,"Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1977,Kyle,Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1998,Kyle,No! We're already halfway done. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2002,Kyle,It's more than you've got! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2005,Kyle,Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2013,Kyle,Hey Chef. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2017,Kyle,"We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2020,Kyle,I told you guys. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2022,Kyle,You hear that dudes? We'll be rich! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2032,Kyle,"We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2037,Kyle,"Yeah Stan, she's just a girl. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2042,Kyle,"Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."" "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2045,Kyle,"Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2047,Kyle,Come on Kenny. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2069,Kyle,"Come on elephant, keep drinking. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2072,Kyle,Dammit! This is never gonna work. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2075,Kyle,"Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2088,Kyle,Hey look! It's working. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2091,Kyle,Aah! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2115,Kyle,Aren't they ever gonna wake up? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2117,Kyle,I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2126,Kyle,"Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2128,Kyle,Couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2140,Kyle,Is he bigger than a regular clone? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2154,Kyle,How big do you think he is? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2156,Kyle,"Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2176,Kyle,"Come on, let's go! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2184,Kyle,"Wait, Stan, there he goes. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2187,Kyle,He recognizes you dude. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2191,Kyle,What should we do with him? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2218,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards! "

1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5296,Kyle,"[Off camera,] You liar, Cartman! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5304,Kyle,"I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5329,Kyle,What would we use a marble sack for? 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5331,Kyle,I didn't steal anything. 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5334,Kyle,Good!

1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5415,Kyle,What the hell are you doing?! 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5418,Kyle,"Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5423,Kyle,"Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5425,Kyle,"If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5427,Kyle,"There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5450,Kyle,Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up. 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5457,Kyle,Your triangle? 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5466,Kyle,"Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5478,Kyle,Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers? 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5502,Kyle,"Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fat-ass! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5506,Kyle,Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!

1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5666,Kyle,Disintegration is the best album everrr! 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5669,Kyle,We've got to get rid of them. 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5671,Kyle,Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5676,Kyle,"Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?! "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5682,Kyle,"Well, that whole experience sure did suck. "
1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5684,Kyle,"But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead. "

2,3,Chickenlover,7083,Kyle,Who are you? 
2,3,Chickenlover,7088,Kyle,"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. "
2,3,Chickenlover,7118,Kyle,It looks like a note. 
2,3,Chickenlover,7135,Kyle,Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.

2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7531,Kyle,Uhhh... I'm not sure. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7560,Kyle,Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7568,Kyle,How's it going? 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7570,Kyle,Why bad? 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7576,Kyle,"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits. "

2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7737,Kyle,"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7739,Kyle,Dammit! 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7741,Kyle,"Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7743,Kyle,"Ready, Ike? Kick the baby! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7746,Kyle,"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7770,Kyle,"There, what do you think? "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7772,Kyle,"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7774,Kyle,Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7776,Kyle,"No, go away! Bad dog! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7778,Kyle,I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7787,Kyle,"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7789,Kyle,"Knock it off, asshole! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7806,Kyle,"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7809,Kyle,"[Doing Ike.] Bye-bye seeme mama. [As himself.] Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7813,Kyle,"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7817,Kyle,"Put him down, you stupid dog! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7837,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it? "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7840,Kyle,What?? 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7842,Kyle,"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7844,Kyle,"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7849,Kyle,"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7856,Kyle,[Flatly] You bastards. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7873,Kyle,"Aw, how the hell should I know? "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7879,Kyle,"[Grousing.] All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7881,Kyle,"Yeah, right. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7898,Kyle,[Pointing at Ike.] He's not my brother! 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7900,Kyle,"[Angrily.] I'm sorry, Ike. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7938,Kyle,What do you want?! 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7941,Kyle,"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7943,Kyle,No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7947,Kyle,"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7980,Kyle,You stay away from my little brother! 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7982,Kyle,"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7984,Kyle,And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?! 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7990,Kyle,"No! No, it isn't true! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8003,Kyle,"It's okay, Ike. I'm here. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8008,Kyle,"[Gets up.] Ike, you're okay. [Cartman and Stan get up.] "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8010,Kyle,"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8012,Kyle,And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family. [Tugs on Ike and moves away.] Except for Cartman. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8026,Kyle,M'kay?

2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8164,Kyle,Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?

2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8711,Kyle,"Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8713,Kyle,Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... [Indistinct whisper.] 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8728,Kyle,"Dude, I can't believe they fell for it! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8733,Kyle,Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8785,Kyle,"[Holding the camera.] Der, Cartman! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8787,Kyle,"Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! [Resumes filming.] "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8794,Kyle,"'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8850,Kyle,"Dude, they're gonna look so stupid. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8905,Kyle,Look! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8912,Kyle,"Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! [Grins.] "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8916,Kyle,"Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8922,Kyle,Who are you? 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8988,Kyle,You bastards! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9018,Kyle,Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9027,Kyle,Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable. 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9033,Kyle,Wait a sec. Where is your producer? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9051,Kyle,"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9055,Kyle,"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9057,Kyle,"I know, but, it's really snowy today. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9064,Kyle,"Oh, she would, dude. She would. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9072,Kyle,"Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9080,Kyle,I'm scared! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9101,Kyle,"Yeah, what are we supposed to do? "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9112,Kyle,"'Cause, dumbass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9114,Kyle,"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.' "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9144,Kyle,"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9147,Kyle,What? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9150,Kyle,Worse than this? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9155,Kyle,How come the visitors aren't coming for him. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9159,Kyle,"Yeah. [Shouting] All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9161,Kyle,Sure you do! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9165,Kyle,"Fart, damn you! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9168,Kyle,"Whoa, look at that. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9177,Kyle,"Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9184,Kyle,You can say that again. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9215,Kyle,Nope. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9218,Kyle,"Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9223,Kyle,"Don't do it, kid. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9229,Kyle,"Holy crap, dude! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9272,Kyle,On Wednesday or Thursday? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9276,Kyle,"Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9281,Kyle,"Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. [He sits back down.] "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9283,Kyle,Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9291,Kyle,Oh my God! Look at his leg! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9293,Kyle,Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9301,Kyle,Dude! He's making ice cream. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9304,Kyle,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9308,Kyle,"Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9368,Kyle,What was what? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9370,Kyle,What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9372,Kyle,"Hey yeah, I remember that. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9379,Kyle,[Sees Death close to Kenny.] Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9387,Kyle,You... bastard? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9393,Kyle,"Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9401,Kyle,You bastard! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9423,Kyle,We've just gotta stick together. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9441,Kyle,You bastards! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9444,Kyle,"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too? "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9450,Kyle,What are we gonna do? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9457,Kyle,There. [Drops into his seat.] I think we got it. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9459,Kyle,Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9461,Kyle,Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9464,Kyle,"Don't do it, kid. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9470,Kyle,"Holy crap, dude! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9472,Kyle,Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9480,Kyle,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9494,Kyle,"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9503,Kyle,[Pointing at Stan.] Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9529,Kyle,Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9536,Kyle,Oh no! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9561,Kyle,"[Already up, reaches for the phone.] Hello? "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9563,Kyle,Really? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9565,Kyle,Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9567,Kyle,Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9611,Kyle,What do you mean? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9617,Kyle,I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9619,Kyle,Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9627,Kyle,We wanna buy M-80s. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9633,Kyle,What a baby. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9638,Kyle,What do ya mean? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9641,Kyle,"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s? "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9644,Kyle,Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9647,Kyle,Oo bastards! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9650,Kyle,"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do? "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9667,Kyle,"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9669,Kyle,Yeah! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9673,Kyle,"Let's go, dude. We're ready. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9676,Kyle,Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9684,Kyle,Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9719,Kyle,[Singing.] Dusty the dirtball...   
2,8,Summer Sucks,9721,Kyle,"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9724,Kyle,"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet? "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9729,Kyle,Yup. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9739,Kyle,"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9743,Kyle,"[Grins with Stan.] Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9748,Kyle,"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9751,Kyle,Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9846,Kyle,I heard you won't even get in the deep end. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9890,Kyle,[Looking up.] Dude! That thing is huge! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9899,Kyle,Kenny! Watch out! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9906,Kyle,You bastard! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9918,Kyle,"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon! "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9924,Kyle,What'd he say? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9927,Kyle,How is that gonna help? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,10013,Kyle,"A lot, I think. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,10015,Kyle,"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,10020,Kyle,We're bored. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,10029,Kyle,Wow! These are huge! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,10051,Kyle,"Hey, look! It's snowing! "
2,8,Summer Sucks,10059,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10085,Kyle,"They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10113,Kyle,"Sick, Kenny. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10116,Kyle,All this for a bunch of stupid movies? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10128,Kyle,Cool! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10144,Kyle,If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10169,Kyle," I can see clearly now, the rain is gone I can see all obstacles in my way-   "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10171,Kyle,"I'm poopies, ma! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10173,Kyle, Gone are the dark clouds that had me-   
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10176,Kyle,Could it be? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10179,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10183,Kyle,"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10185,Kyle,"Well, I'm sure it was him. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10194,Kyle,"So how was that movie last night, dude? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10200,Kyle,Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10210,Kyle,Well? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10230,Kyle,There it is again! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10235,Kyle,It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10238,Kyle,Where does that grill go? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10240,Kyle,"Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10242,Kyle,Come on! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10247,Kyle,"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10252,Kyle,"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10257,Kyle,What the hell? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10263,Kyle,In a sewer? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10269,Kyle,"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10273,Kyle,Mr. Hankey! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10275,Kyle,I told you guys he'd be here! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10286,Kyle,"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10292,Kyle,And that's why you got a cold? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10297,Kyle,"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10302,Kyle,"[Rushing in.] Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10305,Kyle,Aaahh! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10308,Kyle,"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10310,Kyle,"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10315,Kyle,Huh?? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10329,Kyle,"Dude, no one even listened to me. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10349,Kyle,Mr. Hankey! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10351,Kyle,Mr. Hankey?! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10353,Kyle,Mr. Hankey? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10357,Kyle,They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10360,Kyle,[Determined.] We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10362,Kyle,It's the only way to prove to them that you're real. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10364,Kyle,"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10386,Kyle,"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10388,Kyle,"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10408,Kyle,"You guys, we have to hurry! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10410,Kyle,Come on! Everything's gonna be okay! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10412,Kyle,Sir! Sir! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10414,Kyle,I have to show you something. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10416,Kyle,I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10419,Kyle,I want you guys to all meet my friend. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10422,Kyle,"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10428,Kyle,"Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10431,Kyle,Nooohohohohohoho- 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10433,Kyle,"What is it, Mr. Hankey? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10436,Kyle,What is it? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10439,Kyle,Yes? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10444,Kyle,Nooo! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10447,Kyle,Nooo! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10450,Kyle,[Weeping.] Noo! No! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10455,Kyle,Uuf. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10475,Kyle,I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10477,Kyle,"Chef, does poo go to heaven? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10487,Kyle,[Rushes back.] Mr. Hankey? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10489,Kyle,He's back! He's back! [Chef returns.] 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10492,Kyle,"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10506,Kyle,Wait! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10508,Kyle,I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10511,Kyle,Behold! Mr. Hankey! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10523,Kyle,No! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10527,Kyle,[Crying.] O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10533,Kyle,I don't know. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10555,Kyle,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10599,Kyle,Are you guys having a meeting or something? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10602,Kyle,Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10606,Kyle,I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10609,Kyle,"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10611,Kyle,"Well, here's Kenny's house. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10629,Kyle,"Heheheh, buns. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10635,Kyle,Oh my God. This is like a third-world country. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10651,Kyle,I don't know. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10672,Kyle,Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10674,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell is that? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10676,Kyle,"No, it's not cool! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10715,Kyle,Yeah. I feel great! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10717,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10719,Kyle,Yes. Why? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10721,Kyle,"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10723,Kyle,"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10725,Kyle,Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10727,Kyle,"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10729,Kyle,"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10733,Kyle,Gods and clods? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10735,Kyle,"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10774,Kyle,"Could we go home now, Ma? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10776,Kyle,But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10778,Kyle,"What's ""ookie mouth""? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10780,Kyle,"Sick, dude! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10790,Kyle,"Ookie mouth! [Kenny spits in.] Gross! I can't do it, Ma! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10793,Kyle,Argh! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10804,Kyle,"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10844,Kyle,What the hell does that have to do with American history? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10846,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10848,Kyle,"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10865,Kyle,"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."" "
2,10,Chickenpox,10870,Kyle,[Softly.] What? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10872,Kyle,[Frightened.] Oh my God! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10874,Kyle,[Angry.] You! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10877,Kyle,You! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10879,Kyle,You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10881,Kyle,"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10883,Kyle,"You get away from me, you crazy woman! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10897,Kyle,[Rushing in.] Stan! Stan! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10899,Kyle,"[Softly.] Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10901,Kyle,Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10903,Kyle,"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10905,Kyle,Yeah. And I think I figured out why. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10907,Kyle,Because they're a bunch of assholes. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10909,Kyle,"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10915,Kyle,"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago? "
2,10,Chickenpox,10918,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10922,Kyle,"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10992,Kyle,"Chef, we wanna know about herpes. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10994,Kyle,Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10997,Kyle,Do you know anybody with herpes? 
2,10,Chickenpox,11001,Kyle,"Cool! Thanks, Chef! "
2,10,Chickenpox,11012,Kyle,Are you old Frida? 
2,10,Chickenpox,11014,Kyle,Someone who wants a favor. 
2,10,Chickenpox,11016,Kyle,"[To Stan, throws his hands up.] Huh? "
2,10,Chickenpox,11020,Kyle,"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital. "
2,10,Chickenpox,11026,Kyle,"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes! "
2,10,Chickenpox,11037,Kyle,"Aw, man. [Tottering, eyes half shut.] I don't feel so good. "
2,10,Chickenpox,11039,Kyle,Ugh... 
2,10,Chickenpox,11044,Kyle,We're sorry. 
2,10,Chickenpox,11046,Kyle,"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman. "
2,10,Chickenpox,11056,Kyle,I'm better now. 
2,10,Chickenpox,11059,Kyle,We gave you guys herpes. 
2,10,Chickenpox,11079,Kyle,You bastards! 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11086,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11094,Kyle,To where? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11100,Kyle,"Yeah, all the constellations look alike. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11127,Kyle,"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11137,Kyle,I thought it was planetarium. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11147,Kyle,"Hey, who are you? "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11160,Kyle,[Not amused.] Whoopie. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11187,Kyle,"Oh, man, I don't feel so good. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11189,Kyle,Me too. It was sweet. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11194,Kyle,Did what? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11200,Kyle,My head still feels funny. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11203,Kyle,"Like you really need it, hippo-ass! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11208,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11256,Kyle,"[counting off the syllables]  Fatass Cartman was not on the school bus today. What a big, fat turd.   "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11261,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again? "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11265,Kyle,I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11281,Kyle," Ass full of pork fat jiggles like a Jello mold. Mouth is flapping, too.   "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11285,Kyle, I bet you don't win. They don't let big fat asses perform on TV.   
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11325,Kyle,What do you mean? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11343,Kyle,Sshh! 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11362,Kyle,Why? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11364,Kyle,"Oh, yeah. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11367,Kyle,Here's the control panel that operates all the stars. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11374,Kyle,"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11378,Kyle,What does that do? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11381,Kyle,Kenny! What's it doing? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11386,Kyle,We're bastards! 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11390,Kyle,"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11444,Kyle,"But it's true, dude! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11504,Kyle,"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11526,Kyle,He's not highly intelligent. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11564,Kyle,[Coming out of the trance.] Cartman! You saved us! 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11577,Kyle,He got a full dose of the stars. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11579,Kyle,"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11596,Kyle,Yeah! You're dead! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11600,Kyle,"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11607,Kyle,Well? Now what are we going to do? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11614,Kyle,I dunno. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11616,Kyle,Okay. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11635,Kyle,We do? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11662,Kyle,"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11687,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11690,Kyle,"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11709,Kyle,"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11711,Kyle,"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11713,Kyle,What? Why? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11715,Kyle,Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11720,Kyle,"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11722,Kyle,"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11725,Kyle,Fine! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11729,Kyle,Fine! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11731,Kyle,Fine! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11763,Kyle,When is Mr. Hat coming back? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11765,Kyle,When is Mr. Hat coming back? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11784,Kyle,"Good guess, dude! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11866,Kyle,Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11868,Kyle,To me?? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11871,Kyle,"We should use nails, dude. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11883,Kyle,"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11885,Kyle,"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11967,Kyle,"[Wiggling the railing.] Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11971,Kyle,Okay. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12008,Kyle,"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12012,Kyle,Right. Why? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12014,Kyle,Too eager to what? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12024,Kyle,Okay. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12027,Kyle,Yeah? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12029,Kyle,Umm. Dare? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12032,Kyle,What? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12038,Kyle,"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl! "
2,12,Clubhouses,12040,Kyle,"It's just wrong, that's all. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12042,Kyle,What the hell have you gotten me into?! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12045,Kyle,Hoh boy. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12047,Kyle,Sick! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12049,Kyle,Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12081,Kyle,Okay. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12083,Kyle,Huh? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12085,Kyle,"Okay, that's fine. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12088,Kyle,[Muffled.] But I don't care. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12139,Kyle,You bastard! 
2,13,Cow Days,12239,Kyle,"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. "
2,13,Cow Days,12242,Kyle,"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs. "
2,13,Cow Days,12248,Kyle,"Dude, that kicks ass! "
2,13,Cow Days,12262,Kyle,"You suck, Cartman! "
2,13,Cow Days,12264,Kyle,Give me that! 
2,13,Cow Days,12266,Kyle,Hey! It hit her right in the mouth! 
2,13,Cow Days,12268,Kyle,But ih- 
2,13,Cow Days,12270,Kyle,"Here, give me some money, Cartman! "
2,13,Cow Days,12272,Kyle,"Lend me money, fat boy! "
2,13,Cow Days,12274,Kyle,Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
2,13,Cow Days,12278,Kyle,"Mom, give me some money! "
2,13,Cow Days,12280,Kyle,I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls. 
2,13,Cow Days,12282,Kyle,I will if you give me money! 
2,13,Cow Days,12302,Kyle,Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw. 
2,13,Cow Days,12310,Kyle,Is it like a- haunted house or something? 
2,13,Cow Days,12313,Kyle,"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls. "
2,13,Cow Days,12315,Kyle,"You'd better be right, dude. "
2,13,Cow Days,12319,Kyle,Okay. 
2,13,Cow Days,12329,Kyle,That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen! 
2,13,Cow Days,12332,Kyle,"That was a waste of money, Cartman! "
2,13,Cow Days,12334,Kyle,We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game. 
2,13,Cow Days,12339,Kyle,This ride better be good! 
2,13,Cow Days,12342,Kyle,We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour! 
2,13,Cow Days,12345,Kyle,Finally! 
2,13,Cow Days,12348,Kyle,Yeah. 
2,13,Cow Days,12350,Kyle,Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me! 
2,13,Cow Days,12355,Kyle,"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls! "
2,13,Cow Days,12363,Kyle,"You dumbass, Cartman! "
2,13,Cow Days,12365,Kyle,"No, it's not cool! "
2,13,Cow Days,12371,Kyle,"How much do we have left, Cartman? "
2,13,Cow Days,12373,Kyle,"How much do we have left, Cartman?! "
2,13,Cow Days,12375,Kyle,"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman! "
2,13,Cow Days,12377,Kyle,You son of a bitch! Aaargh! 
2,13,Cow Days,12381,Kyle,"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls! "
2,13,Cow Days,12383,Kyle,"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it? "
2,13,Cow Days,12388,Kyle,"Give him your food stamps, Kenny! "
2,13,Cow Days,12390,Kyle,"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure! "
2,13,Cow Days,12394,Kyle,Okay. Here we go. 
2,13,Cow Days,12396,Kyle,Hey! That was right on target. 
2,13,Cow Days,12399,Kyle,That does it! Shenanigans! 
2,13,Cow Days,12401,Kyle,SHENANIGANS! 
2,13,Cow Days,12403,Kyle,I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged! 
2,13,Cow Days,12406,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator. "
2,13,Cow Days,12408,Kyle,This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth! 
2,13,Cow Days,12417,Kyle,It worked! 
2,13,Cow Days,12426,Kyle,No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there. 
2,13,Cow Days,12428,Kyle,What?! 
2,13,Cow Days,12430,Kyle,"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win- "
2,13,Cow Days,12432,Kyle,"Damnit, I have to have those dolls! "
2,13,Cow Days,12435,Kyle,"[Something stops him.] Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000. "
2,13,Cow Days,12437,Kyle,"Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls! "
2,13,Cow Days,12439,Kyle,"[Grabbing Cartman by the collar.] Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open! "
2,13,Cow Days,12441,Kyle,"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice! "
2,13,Cow Days,12452,Kyle,"You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman? "
2,13,Cow Days,12462,Kyle,That wasn't quite ten seconds. 
2,13,Cow Days,12467,Kyle,"Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice! "
2,13,Cow Days,12471,Kyle,"What'd you say, Cartman?? "
2,13,Cow Days,12473,Kyle,I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull. 
2,13,Cow Days,12478,Kyle,"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull. "
2,13,Cow Days,12480,Kyle,"Okay, Cartman. You ready? "
2,13,Cow Days,12482,Kyle,Open the gate! 
2,13,Cow Days,12485,Kyle,[Whispers to Stan.] That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything! 
2,13,Cow Days,12488,Kyle,Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball. 
2,13,Cow Days,12492,Kyle,That's better. 
2,13,Cow Days,12498,Kyle,"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough! "
2,13,Cow Days,12503,Kyle,"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing! "
2,13,Cow Days,12505,Kyle,Get up! 
2,13,Cow Days,12507,Kyle,Get UP! 
2,13,Cow Days,12512,Kyle,"Dude, I think we broke him. "
2,13,Cow Days,12517,Kyle,..Oh. 
2,13,Cow Days,12520,Kyle,We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it? 
2,13,Cow Days,12523,Kyle,Damn it! 
2,13,Cow Days,12530,Kyle,You think? 
2,13,Cow Days,12546,Kyle,He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute. 
2,13,Cow Days,12549,Kyle,"Yeah, I think so. "
2,13,Cow Days,12562,Kyle,"Hey, where's Cartman? "
2,13,Cow Days,12586,Kyle,"He's up in, like, twenty minutes! "
2,13,Cow Days,12609,Kyle,"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake. "
2,13,Cow Days,12624,Kyle,What do you mean? 
2,13,Cow Days,12629,Kyle,"Hang on, Cartman! "
2,13,Cow Days,12645,Kyle,"Go help him, Kenny! "
2,13,Cow Days,12650,Kyle,You bastards! 
2,13,Cow Days,12681,Kyle,How many ball does that get us? 
2,13,Cow Days,12684,Kyle,You will? 
2,13,Cow Days,12687,Kyle,"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls! "
2,13,Cow Days,12689,Kyle,What are we gonna do with them? 
2,13,Cow Days,12693,Kyle,..What the-? 
2,13,Cow Days,12696,Kyle,After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 
2,13,Cow Days,12699,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off! "
2,13,Cow Days,12738,Kyle,"[With a Phillip doll.] Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh. "
2,13,Cow Days,12742,Kyle,Really? What about? 
2,13,Cow Days,12749,Kyle,"No! Cartman, that was just a dream! "
2,14,Chef Aid,12756,Kyle,"What the hell are you singing, Cartman? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12766,Kyle,When is Mr. Hat coming back? 
2,14,Chef Aid,12772,Kyle,He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12780,Kyle,He singing some new hit song. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12788,Kyle,"Wow, then you should get money for it! "
2,14,Chef Aid,12790,Kyle,"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12797,Kyle,It’s the same goddamn song! 
2,14,Chef Aid,12804,Kyle,We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer! 
2,14,Chef Aid,12842,Kyle,I don't know. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12845,Kyle,"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12888,Kyle,What's going on? 
2,14,Chef Aid,12891,Kyle,"Yeah. Ready, Cartman? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12899,Kyle,"What's that, dude? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12901,Kyle,Did you ever know any famous people? 
2,14,Chef Aid,12931,Kyle,"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12940,Kyle,"Yeah, b-but how? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12944,Kyle,"Whoa, dude, this house is huge. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12952,Kyle,Are you Elton John? 
2,14,Chef Aid,12954,Kyle,"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12956,Kyle,"Hi, are you Elton John? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12958,Kyle,We're trying to raise money for our school chef. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12964,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12989,Kyle,"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13008,Kyle,"He’s not dying, Cartman! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13013,Kyle,Yeah. Do you know him? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13041,Kyle,"Gosh, thanks, Rick James. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13068,Kyle,We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed. 
2,14,Chef Aid,13070,Kyle,Cartman? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13074,Kyle,But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13088,Kyle,Dude... Chef is gone. 
2,14,Chef Aid,13095,Kyle,But what are we gonna do? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13097,Kyle,Chef Aid? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13099,Kyle,"Hey, that's a great idea! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13123,Kyle,Hmm... This isn't going over so well. 
2,14,Chef Aid,13133,Kyle,"Wow, cool! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13182,Kyle,We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you! 
2,14,Chef Aid,13198,Kyle,"Well, we helped. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13217,Kyle,You bastard! 
2,14,Chef Aid,13245,Kyle,"Hey, that's your song for Wendy! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13278,Kyle,He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13281,Kyle,"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13283,Kyle,Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13290,Kyle,"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13329,Kyle,"Where have you been, dude? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13331,Kyle,Aunt Flo? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13333,Kyle,Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13335,Kyle,Here he comes. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13338,Kyle,"You said you could get us money, Cartman! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13340,Kyle,"Well, at least he's back to normal. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13342,Kyle,It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13346,Kyle,That's not cool! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13404,Kyle,"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13409,Kyle,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman! [to Kenny] How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? [as Kyle says this Stan enters the room] Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13412,Kyle,"God, will you shut up?! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13414,Kyle,Yeah. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13416,Kyle,"I don't know. [the bearded Cartman comes in with a huge knife] Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13419,Kyle,"You seem tired, Stan. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13421,Kyle,Why? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13423,Kyle,"Hoh, that sucks, dude. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13425,Kyle,Cartman? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13429,Kyle,"You can't be standing there, Cartman. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13431,Kyle,Because you're standing over there! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13454,Kyle,"Uh, Chef? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13456,Kyle,Chef. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13458,Kyle,Chef. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13460,Kyle,Chef! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13462,Kyle,We have problems! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13475,Kyle,Will you stop saying that word?! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13484,Kyle,Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13499,Kyle,Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13505,Kyle,"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. [the fish jumps out and somehow pulls Kenny into the tank head first.] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13507,Kyle,"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13546,Kyle,What? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13550,Kyle,"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"" "
2,15,Spookyfish,13558,Kyle,Like what? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13581,Kyle,"You kick ass, evil Cartman! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13583,Kyle,"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! [the boys exit the store, and the skies are clear] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13595,Kyle,"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13598,Kyle,"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella."" "
2,15,Spookyfish,13601,Kyle,"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13629,Kyle,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13632,Kyle,"Leave him alone, butthole! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13639,Kyle,"It's the evil pets [the attack continues, and a vulture knocks the gingerification gun out of Evil Stan's hands.] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13650,Kyle,"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! [Cartman takes on Evil Cartman, and both wrestle. Cartman rips off Evil Cartman's mustache and beard, and kicks him. Both of them then stand up, indistinguishable. Stan pulls the gingerification gun back] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13651,Kyle,Which one is the good Cartman? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13654,Kyle,"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13663,Kyle,"Oh no, dude! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13666,Kyle,Damn it! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13689,Kyle,"That's nice, Cartman. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13700,Kyle,Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13708,Kyle,Please stop. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13710,Kyle,[insistent] Please stop! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13717,Kyle,What's all that stuff? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13720,Kyle,"Hey, look! [enunciating a billboard] See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13722,Kyle,"[now seated] I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13724,Kyle,It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13726,Kyle,Cool! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13733,Kyle,"Oh, God! [Stan is dejected] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13738,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, finally! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13753,Kyle,Agghh! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13759,Kyle,[to Stan] That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13772,Kyle,"Dude, your family died? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13774,Kyle,What?! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13777,Kyle,What is this?? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13779,Kyle,"[eyes shut] Sick, dude! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13784,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! [Stan is surprised] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13791,Kyle,[Great-Grandma urinates into the bag. He grimaces] Aaww! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13797,Kyle,"[watching the mess] Jesus, dude! [Kenny stuffs his food into a paper bag, and Jimmy growls longingly] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13802,Kyle,I know what you mean. [Kenny packs the last of his meal away] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13804,Kyle,[jumps up] Arrggh! [Stan wakes up] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13806,Kyle,"Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13808,Kyle,"Oh. Arrggh! [thump. Kenny's awake. More sounds, of breaking glass.] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13810,Kyle,"I heard it, too. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13814,Kyle,"[moving back to his sleeping bag] I wanted to make sure, too. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13816,Kyle,"Dude, it's coming through the window! [the window flies open and light streams in. A fat figure jumps in and the kids scream. Cartman goes for the light switch and the light goes on. A surprised prison escapee is what he sees] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13838,Kyle,"We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13873,Kyle,"Yeah, they do! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13878,Kyle,"Dude, we have to get to the mall!! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13886,Kyle,"Good for you, Charlie! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13905,Kyle,[jumping up and down to get a better look] Do you see him? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13907,Kyle,I can't wait to see him! [a kid looks back] He's gonna be so glad we came! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13909,Kyle,"That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13913,Kyle,So?! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13915,Kyle,"Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. [Charlie Manson and Kenny stare at each other. The line moves up] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13926,Kyle,"[elated] Hoh, boy. Here we go! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13930,Kyle,You're not the real Mr. Hankey. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13935,Kyle,This is not Mr. Hankey! [a picture is taken] This is a fake! [gasps from other kids and adults. A boy cries] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13938,Kyle,Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13940,Kyle,[insulted] What?! What did you say?! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13943,Kyle,[stands and rips off the mall Hankey's helmet] Behold! Here's your false prophet! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13964,Kyle,It was a fake! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13966,Kyle,Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13982,Kyle,"I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13993,Kyle,"God, I hate the holiday season! [more shots] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14027,Kyle,"What's your mom doing here, dude? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14078,Kyle,[peering out] You bastards! [the police don't react. Everyone now pours out of the house] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14088,Kyle,Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays. 
2,17,Gnomes,14118,Kyle,Yeah. 
2,17,Gnomes,14128,Kyle,We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek. 
2,17,Gnomes,14167,Kyle,"[angry] No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas? "
2,17,Gnomes,14178,Kyle,"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. "
2,17,Gnomes,14181,Kyle,"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up. "
2,17,Gnomes,14192,Kyle,We're his oral report buddies. 
2,17,Gnomes,14196,Kyle,Coffee? I don't think I like coffee. 
2,17,Gnomes,14207,Kyle,We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes. 
2,17,Gnomes,14211,Kyle,"Come on, you guys! We better get to work! "
2,17,Gnomes,14217,Kyle,"Man, this stuff is strong. "
2,17,Gnomes,14220,Kyle,[going to him] Don't worry about it. 
2,17,Gnomes,14225,Kyle,"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up. "
2,17,Gnomes,14228,Kyle,Woohoo! 
2,17,Gnomes,14231,Kyle,"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome! "
2,17,Gnomes,14235,Kyle,"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff? "
2,17,Gnomes,14237,Kyle,Killer!! [goes for it and eats it raw] 
2,17,Gnomes,14239,Kyle,"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee! "
2,17,Gnomes,14241,Kyle,"Hogh, my stomach hurts. "
2,17,Gnomes,14243,Kyle,"[peeved] Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek. "
2,17,Gnomes,14257,Kyle,"Sure. [""work all night""] "
2,17,Gnomes,14263,Kyle,"[to Richard] Thanks, dude. "
2,17,Gnomes,14267,Kyle,"Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?! "
2,17,Gnomes,14270,Kyle,"[haltingly] ""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America... "
2,17,Gnomes,14275,Kyle,"And that's our report, I guess. "
2,17,Gnomes,14291,Kyle,I think it went really good. Those people really got into it. 
2,17,Gnomes,14299,Kyle,Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee? 
2,17,Gnomes,14301,Kyle,Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous. 
2,17,Gnomes,14310,Kyle,My butt hurts. 
2,17,Gnomes,14364,Kyle,Uh... 
2,17,Gnomes,14373,Kyle,[screen right to screen left] I don't like big corporations. 
2,17,Gnomes,14416,Kyle,"Oh, God, when is this gonna end? "
2,17,Gnomes,14420,Kyle,So what are we gonna say? 
2,17,Gnomes,14423,Kyle,"Does anybody know anything about corporations? [the gnomes return, and Tweek gasps. The door opens and the gnomes enter, singing their theme:""Time to go to work, work all nightSearch for underpants, hey""] "
2,17,Gnomes,14428,Kyle,"Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?[""work all nightSearch for underpants, hey""] "
2,17,Gnomes,14431,Kyle,"[looking down] Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  [""Time to go to work""] "
2,17,Gnomes,14436,Kyle,"Sshh, don't scare him. "
2,17,Gnomes,14439,Kyle,Cartman! 
2,17,Gnomes,14441,Kyle,Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?! 
2,17,Gnomes,14450,Kyle,"Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid. "
2,17,Gnomes,14455,Kyle,Show us. 
2,17,Gnomes,14475,Kyle,Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass. 
2,17,Gnomes,14480,Kyle,"Sooo, what's phase 2? "
2,17,Gnomes,14489,Kyle,Do you guys know anything about corporations? 
2,17,Gnomes,14496,Kyle,"You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers. "
2,17,Gnomes,14503,Kyle,What? 
2,17,Gnomes,14514,Kyle,Big corporations are good! 
2,17,Gnomes,14518,Kyle,Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup. 
2,17,Gnomes,14523,Kyle,"Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14547,Kyle,"Go, dude, go! [excited, the boys jump on the sofa] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14553,Kyle,[to Stan] Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14558,Kyle,"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14560,Kyle,"Get away from me, Cartman! [backs away] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14562,Kyle,[trips over a rock and tumbles down the slope] AAAAAAAAAA! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14565,Kyle,[from the bottom of a dark shaft. His figure disappears] HELP! [thud] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14571,Kyle,You guuuys! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14573,Kyle,I think so. Is Cartman up there? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14575,Kyle,"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14578,Kyle,I don't think so. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14583,Kyle,"Sick, dude! [wipes some off his cap] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14586,Kyle,"Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14590,Kyle,"Dude, it's a dude! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14595,Kyle,Wow. Cool. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14603,Kyle,"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14608,Kyle,I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14610,Kyle,"No, dude! We have to name it Steve. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14612,Kyle,"It's my name, and I found him. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14614,Kyle,"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14616,Kyle,"Kenny, who found the ice man? "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14629,Kyle,But we found a frozen ice man from the past! [all stop] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14631,Kyle,No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14633,Kyle,We came for our reward. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14640,Kyle,Sweet. How about Steve? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14654,Kyle,"[Stan and Kenny in the background] Well, I fell down this ice cavern, [Stan interrupts him with ""la""s] and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- [Kenny looks at Stan, and Kyle glances back] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14685,Kyle,Gorak's a gay name. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14687,Kyle,Why are you being such a dick? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14689,Kyle,Nuh-uh! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14691,Kyle,I'll go. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14702,Kyle,You bastards! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14728,Kyle,"Good job, dude! You freaked him out! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14731,Kyle,Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14735,Kyle,Fine! [turns and walks away] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14761,Kyle,"No, he sure doesn't. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14763,Kyle,"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14775,Kyle,He's my creature! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14779,Kyle,But it isn't right! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14785,Kyle,What?! I'm not talking to you! [walks away] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14793,Kyle,[reaches the access door] I'm here to bust out Steve. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14795,Kyle,His name is Steve! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14798,Kyle,Steve! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14800,Kyle,Steve! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14802,Kyle,"Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14804,Kyle,Does so! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14810,Kyle,You're a dick! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14812,Kyle,"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14814,Kyle,"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock? "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14816,Kyle,"[hushed] Oh yeah. [loudly] Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! [walks away] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14874,Kyle,"[rushing in with a travel guide] Steve, wait! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14876,Kyle,"I've got something to show Steve, dick! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14878,Kyle,"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14880,Kyle,"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see? [opens the guide to show Des Moines's assets] Everybody looks like you do. [flips the page] Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14883,Kyle,"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14885,Kyle,"No you don't, butthole! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14899,Kyle,"We have to get our friend, Steve- "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14901,Kyle,"-to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14903,Kyle,"Frosty, Steve, whatever. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14907,Kyle,"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14910,Kyle,"Okay. First one to die, loses. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14912,Kyle,Okay. [neither one moves] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14914,Kyle,"So, here we go. [puts up his fists] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14916,Kyle,Go. [they lock fists and start fighting] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14932,Kyle,[punched in return] Ow! [he throws Stan down] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14934,Kyle,Oh. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14938,Kyle,"[blinks, then] Oh. Okay, it's over this way. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14948,Kyle,Later. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14951,Kyle,Uh huh. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14954,Kyle,Cool. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14960,Kyle,His name... is Steve! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14969,Kyle,"Steve! Steve, look out! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14975,Kyle,"Steve, look out! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15003,Kyle,I can't believe he's gone. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15006,Kyle,Hey! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15016,Kyle,"No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15019,Kyle,Me too. He sucks. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15041,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15057,Kyle,"Hey, Craig. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15062,Kyle,Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15065,Kyle,You can't do that! [Cartman's jaw drops] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15143,Kyle,Thanks! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15145,Kyle,"Fuck off, Cartman! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15147,Kyle,[alarmed] No! That's a stereotype. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15152,Kyle,"God-damn, it's hot out here! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15154,Kyle,"No, dude. That's a branch. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15156,Kyle,No. That's the same branch again. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15172,Kyle,What's the Yanagopa? 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15188,Kyle,My guess would be yes. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15225,Kyle,"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15228,Kyle,"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15230,Kyle,"Um, no. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15232,Kyle,Rainforests suck! I wanna go home! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15235,Kyle,[Kyle runs into an adult] Aaaaa! There's a dude here! [a soldier holding a shotgun] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15241,Kyle,I want two tostadas and mild sauce. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15246,Kyle,Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15258,Kyle,Hey! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15295,Kyle,Yeah. It happened once before. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15318,Kyle,"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. [the shrubs around them rustle, and they face the shrubs. Some big-lipped dwarves surround them.] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15328,Kyle,What the hell? 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15333,Kyle,Yeah! Fragile my ass! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15345,Kyle,Dude! Bulldozers rule! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15364,Kyle,You bastards! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15369,Kyle,They're... they're bastards. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15371,Kyle,What? 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15374,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15384,Kyle,"No, I don't think so. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15386,Kyle,"No, that's a hair dryer! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15388,Kyle,"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15390,Kyle,I need to get a nurection for my dad. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15393,Kyle,"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one. [the boys are suddenly outside, with the door slamming shut behind them] Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? [the boys walk away] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15396,Kyle,I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15404,Kyle,You bastards! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15432,Kyle,Yeah. [The boys hop off the bier and move to the front row for the service as Priest Maxi approaches the coffin. He opens the Bible and reads] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15445,Kyle,"Well, I'm Jewish. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15447,Kyle,I guess not. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15451,Kyle,"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15453,Kyle,We'll do it! We'll do it! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15455,Kyle,"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15475,Kyle,He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15483,Kyle,This is gonna be fun. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15485,Kyle,You're too fat to be Jesus! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15487,Kyle,Stan should be Jesus. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15489,Kyle,You're such a fat baby! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15491,Kyle,"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15510,Kyle,"Die! [hits Cartman, dressed as Jesus, with a stick] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15518,Kyle,"I don't know you, dude. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15543,Kyle,"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15545,Kyle,"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15548,Kyle,Yeah. That looks pretty good. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15552,Kyle,"Yeah, me too. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15554,Kyle,"Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15557,Kyle,Then I can give it to my dad. [both turn and leave] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15570,Kyle,"Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15573,Kyle,"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15577,Kyle,"How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15581,Kyle,"Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! [he and Stan leave] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15587,Kyle,"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15589,Kyle,Jesus Christ! [the boys cover their noses with their jackets] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15592,Kyle,"Dude, I think you pooed a lot. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15595,Kyle,"God, that was not cool at all, dude! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15598,Kyle,Yeah. We're having him resurrurected. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15603,Kyle,Sick! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15611,Kyle,It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15628,Kyle,"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15638,Kyle,"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15640,Kyle,"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! [his parents just look at him. He grins and walks away] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15645,Kyle,She's not worried about you. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15649,Kyle,How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15652,Kyle,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15721,Kyle,"[throws a stone] Yeah, take that! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15723,Kyle,"...Oh, yeah. Sorry. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15729,Kyle,"Dude, those people are pissed! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15731,Kyle,Where's your dad? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15733,Kyle,"Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15756,Kyle,"Dude, that was Star Trek again. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15758,Kyle,"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15768,Kyle,She's upstairs. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15770,Kyle,Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. [Ike hops onto the armchair next to Kyle] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15786,Kyle,"Well, my dad is, too. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15788,Kyle,I forgot all about him. [they leave] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15791,Kyle,Wow! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15794,Kyle,"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman? "
3,3,The Succubus,15834,Kyle,I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today? 
3,3,The Succubus,15837,Kyle,"Yeah. [sees Cartman] Oh, here he comes. "
3,3,The Succubus,15841,Kyle,Why? 
3,3,The Succubus,15845,Kyle,"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do. "
3,3,The Succubus,15856,Kyle,Mr. Derp? 
3,3,The Succubus,15864,Kyle,Dude! I hate Mr. Derp! 
3,3,The Succubus,15867,Kyle,"[looks back] Shut up, Cartman! "
3,3,The Succubus,15873,Kyle,"Yeah, but we didn't believe them. "
3,3,The Succubus,15885,Kyle,Moving in?! 
3,3,The Succubus,15892,Kyle,"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better. "
3,3,The Succubus,15899,Kyle,"This... is insane. [ ""Oh, can't you see the-""  ] "
3,3,The Succubus,15901,Kyle,That bitch! 
3,3,The Succubus,15903,Kyle,He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man. 
3,3,The Succubus,15906,Kyle,"Yeah, so? "
3,3,The Succubus,15909,Kyle,"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around. "
3,3,The Succubus,15911,Kyle,Good idea. 
3,3,The Succubus,15926,Kyle,They said that Chef works in one of these buildings [the boys run into Cartman in front of Steinburg & Burgstein Accounting.] 
3,3,The Succubus,15928,Kyle,Dude! Just take them off! 
3,3,The Succubus,15934,Kyle,"He's a big guy, with a beard. "
3,3,The Succubus,15949,Kyle,"We need you, Chef. "
3,3,The Succubus,15952,Kyle,"Chef, this place isn't you! "
3,3,The Succubus,15958,Kyle,"No way, dude! "
3,3,The Succubus,15965,Kyle,Chef should be here any minute. 
3,3,The Succubus,15968,Kyle,[pissed] I can't believe it! 
3,3,The Succubus,15972,Kyle,"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball! "
3,3,The Succubus,15976,Kyle,"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef! "
3,3,The Succubus,15986,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you? "
3,3,The Succubus,15990,Kyle,"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off? "
3,3,The Succubus,15994,Kyle,That's it! 
3,3,The Succubus,15997,Kyle,This is totally what's happening! 
3,3,The Succubus,16000,Kyle,"Thanks, Mr. Garrison. "
3,3,The Succubus,16005,Kyle,Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus. 
3,3,The Succubus,16017,Kyle,"Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him. "
3,3,The Succubus,16020,Kyle,There he is! [rushes in] 
3,3,The Succubus,16028,Kyle,We have to talk to him! 
3,3,The Succubus,16038,Kyle,What's tree-fitty? 
3,3,The Succubus,16083,Kyle,Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus! 
3,3,The Succubus,16087,Kyle,"Well, you are taking Chef from us. [Kenny has loosened his hood] "
3,3,The Succubus,16104,Kyle,[pointing to Veronica] This is not a woman! It is a succubus! 
3,3,The Succubus,16108,Kyle,"[unmoved] Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody! "
3,3,The Succubus,16114,Kyle,I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us. 
3,3,The Succubus,16121,Kyle,"Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."" "
3,3,The Succubus,16123,Kyle,I don't know. 
3,3,The Succubus,16130,Kyle,Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings?  There's got to be a morning after.   
3,3,The Succubus,16133,Kyle,[doubting] In three hours. 
3,3,The Succubus,16135,Kyle,"Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. [Cartman is nodding off, too] "
3,3,The Succubus,16137,Kyle,He's asleep. Wake up fatass! 
3,3,The Succubus,16153,Kyle,[joins in] Bitch. 
3,3,The Succubus,16155,Kyle,Dirty bitch. 
3,3,The Succubus,16167,Kyle,"Now, Cartman!! [No response. Cartman is asleep again.] "
3,3,The Succubus,16170,Kyle,Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! [Kenny punches Cartman] 
3,3,The Succubus,16190,Kyle,You bastard! 
3,3,The Succubus,16208,Kyle,It's great to have you back Chef! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16224,Kyle,"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. [""Hey you guys, sing the song!""] Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... [Cartman gets up and walks away] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16227,Kyle,Just go behind a tree. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16231,Kyle,"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16233,Kyle,"You just squat, stupid! [Cartman begins to lower his pants...] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16236,Kyle,"Watch out for ground eels! [he, Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16238,Kyle,What do you have to think about? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16249,Kyle,"No way, dude! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16251,Kyle,What? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16255,Kyle,"[steps in the poo and looks at his shoe] Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16262,Kyle,Over here! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16268,Kyle,It just ran by here a second ago. [rustling is heard] 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16274,Kyle,[annoyed] It's stupid. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16279,Kyle,"You don't like anything, Cartman! [the creature is shaking from fright, and Cartman looks at it affectionately] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16344,Kyle,Did you smoke some of your mom's crack? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16354,Kyle,What are we supposed to do with him? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16363,Kyle,"[softly, curtly] Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16390,Kyle,"What are you doing, fatass?! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16408,Kyle,"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16424,Kyle,Shut up!! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16456,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16458,Kyle,"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. [he and Stan laugh] "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16464,Kyle,Gross! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16495,Kyle,"Dude, this sucks ass! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16615,Kyle,"We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16617,Kyle,[pointing] There it is! [a shot of Kenny wearing twigs] That must be of the antelope family. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16621,Kyle,Cartman! Wait! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16657,Kyle,Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16674,Kyle,Mr. Adler? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16678,Kyle,"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16687,Kyle,"[hushed, to Stan] Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16702,Kyle,Do you wanna bet? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16714,Kyle,"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? [Craig is still leafing through the scraps] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16724,Kyle,There. Did you see? He just flipped you off. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16728,Kyle,"So, do you agree to fight him after school? "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16743,Kyle,We'll see! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16749,Kyle,"Yeah. That's not cool, dude. [the girls walk by] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16754,Kyle,Tweek and Craig are gonna fight. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16756,Kyle,What? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16761,Kyle,"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! [walks off with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16764,Kyle,[looks up to the second floor] Tweek? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16768,Kyle,"Well, Craig showed up. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16772,Kyle,"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken; [Stan watches as Kyle demonstrates] well, everybody in the world saw it! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16776,Kyle,"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. [turns to walk away] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16833,Kyle,He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16835,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16844,Kyle,"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16859,Kyle,Tweek's gonna fight Craig! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16862,Kyle,"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16864,Kyle,"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. [Craig and Tweek look at each other, but nothing happens] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16872,Kyle,How?? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16878,Kyle,[sighs] Not like that! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16890,Kyle,Fine! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16905,Kyle,"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16962,Kyle,"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16964,Kyle,"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16983,Kyle,"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16986,Kyle,"Get him! [the fighters just pant, stuck to each other] Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that? "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16988,Kyle,Craig just called you a boner! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16990,Kyle,[to Stan:] We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17011,Kyle,You bastards! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17041,Kyle,"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. [Craig flips them off] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17043,Kyle,"Boy, do we ever. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17050,Kyle,"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17057,Kyle,About what? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17066,Kyle,"[to Stan] This is freaking me out, dude. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17087,Kyle,[sitting by Stan] Dude! He got a lawyer? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17089,Kyle,Dad?! 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17165,Kyle,It's... big. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17167,Kyle,"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from? "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17169,Kyle,[thinks a bit] And you don't see a problem with that? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17171,Kyle,"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you? "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17248,Kyle,"I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17250,Kyle,"Hey, what about that stupid panda? "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17262,Kyle,[confused] Huh? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17294,Kyle,Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17296,Kyle,"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17298,Kyle,"[annoyed, looks askance] Hoh God, here we go. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17300,Kyle,Isn't that fascism? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17302,Kyle,Do you? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17343,Kyle,What?? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17348,Kyle,"You bastards! [looks further on] Hey! There he is! [Peetie, the Sexual Harassment Panda, seated on a bench while a whale and an octopus are playing badminton] "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17352,Kyle,"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17357,Kyle,"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! [All mascots within hearing distance turn to see the cause of this outburst] "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17359,Kyle,"Okay, sorry, sorry. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17363,Kyle,That people shouldn't sue each other all the time. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17369,Kyle,"[bursting in] Wait! [Stan, Cartman, and Peetie follow] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18094,Kyle,[shows up] Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18096,Kyle,"Hoh, dude, weak. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18098,Kyle,"Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. [goes inside with Stan and Ike, leaving the Melvins outside sad.] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18105,Kyle,"I'm coming, Ma! [the doorbell rings] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18107,Kyle,"[to himself, angrily] ""Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! [exits] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18109,Kyle,"Oh! Hey, Kenny. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18111,Kyle,"I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18113,Kyle,"It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18115,Kyle,Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18117,Kyle,Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me? 
3,9,Jewbilee,18119,Kyle,...Oh. Kenny isn't special? 
3,9,Jewbilee,18123,Kyle,Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18126,Kyle,"Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18140,Kyle,"No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform! "
3,9,Jewbilee,18143,Kyle,"No, Ike! "
3,9,Jewbilee,18145,Kyle,I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18149,Kyle,What? You want me to lie? 
3,9,Jewbilee,18151,Kyle,"Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun-- "
3,9,Jewbilee,18154,Kyle,"Wow, cool. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18159,Kyle,He was huge. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18168,Kyle,[Ike hides behind him] Who are you? 
3,9,Jewbilee,18170,Kyle,"You have to go with him, Ike. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18172,Kyle,"Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. [points to it.] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18176,Kyle,Kyle Broflovski. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18179,Kyle,"Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18183,Kyle,This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18203,Kyle,"That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. [Kenny does so. The elder spots the new Scouts, but returns to an odd prospect] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18207,Kyle,"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. [Kenny moves forward] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18245,Kyle,"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18247,Kyle,This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18249,Kyle,"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it! "
3,9,Jewbilee,18261,Kyle,"[looks at him] Shh. Shut up, Kenny. [rejoins the rest in chanting, the fire builds, and a huge techno-colored dreidel rises out of the fire. A face appears on it] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18263,Kyle,"[stops long enough to say] That's Moses, stupid! [rejoins the rest in chanting] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18268,Kyle,"[steps up and offers his] It's a duck. [Kenny steps up, but he's just starting on his sculpture] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18291,Kyle,Don't worry. I know what to do. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18293,Kyle,"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18300,Kyle,He doesn't get cake? 
3,9,Jewbilee,18319,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell is going on?! "
3,9,Jewbilee,18346,Kyle,"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us. "
3,9,Jewbilee,18348,Kyle,Kenny will find a way. 
3,9,Jewbilee,18381,Kyle,"Go, Ike! "
3,9,Jewbilee,18393,Kyle,What is that? 
3,9,Jewbilee,18398,Kyle,Look! [Kenny comes into the clearing and throws the shell against the snow several times.] 
3,9,Jewbilee,18400,Kyle,Kenny! Noooooo! 
3,9,Jewbilee,18407,Kyle,"Kenny! [runs to Kenny, who now lies in a pool of blood. The others follow] "
3,9,Jewbilee,18410,Kyle,"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18424,Kyle,"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18432,Kyle,"[annoyed] Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18444,Kyle,"[two older boys peek out from behind some boxes, then drop down] Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. [the boy with his picture on the shirt pops out and faces them] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18450,Kyle,The what? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18452,Kyle,Nuh-uh. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18461,Kyle,Yeah! Let's see how they like it! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18471,Kyle,"That's not scary, fatass! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18505,Kyle,"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. [Liane bursts out laughing] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18514,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, a dead body. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18517,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18520,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up- [stops] Dig up Kyle's dead grandma?? "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18522,Kyle,Are you insane?! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18525,Kyle,"[""Dude! We're not digging up my grandma I'll get in trouble. ""]"
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18527,Kyle,"[uneasy] Naww, let's dig up somebody else. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18533,Kyle,"[shines his light on a tombstone] This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. [turns off the light. The boys have a moment of silence] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18535,Kyle,Wait. I don't know if this is cool. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18537,Kyle,I don't think my mom would want me doin' this. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18540,Kyle,"I don't really care, dude. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18545,Kyle,"Oh, my God. [the corpse sways to the right, against the casket wall] Hi, ...Grandma. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18547,Kyle,[hops back] Aaaah! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18549,Kyle,"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18552,Kyle,"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18557,Kyle,How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18559,Kyle,"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18562,Kyle,Cartman?! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18577,Kyle,Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18587,Kyle,Shouldn't we hide her better than that? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18589,Kyle,Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18640,Kyle,No Grandma?? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18642,Kyle,[turns and reaches the sled. Stan turns as well] She's not here! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18644,Kyle,"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18664,Kyle,"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18670,Kyle,Somebody took my dead grandma. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18673,Kyle,Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. [starts to sob] 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18686,Kyle,"Then, you'll help us? "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18700,Kyle,Right. [Kenny walks along the shore way in the background] 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18706,Kyle,Wow! That was easy. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18718,Kyle,Whoa. What was that? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18797,Kyle,"Yeah! Where's Grandma? [the dog walks in and begins regurgitating. First, the head comes out] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18887,Kyle,[arrives at the bus stop] Hey dudes. [notices] What are those? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18889,Kyle,Huh? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18891,Kyle,"No, but look. I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18894,Kyle,Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18897,Kyle,Why the hell don't people tell me these things?! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18900,Kyle,What's the Primary Main Objective? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18903,Kyle,"Well, what's the Evil Power? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18906,Kyle,What? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18910,Kyle,[throws down Cyborg Bill] Shit! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18913,Kyle,"[enters] Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18915,Kyle,I'm not sure. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18917,Kyle,I don't know. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18919,Kyle,"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18923,Kyle,"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18925,Kyle,Thanks. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18930,Kyle,Neither do I. [turns and walks out.] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18937,Kyle,[enters] Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18939,Kyle,What? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18941,Kyle,[a little lost] Huh? No. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18947,Kyle,Damnit! [walks out] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19023,Kyle,[rushes up with a new item] I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! [Tthe others look at him and then laugh] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19026,Kyle,Camp? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19029,Kyle,"[quickly saving face] No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? [turns and walks away] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19031,Kyle,"[turns back] Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19034,Kyle,"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19036,Kyle,God damnit! [turns and hurries away] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19057,Kyle,...our hearts. [looks left] Kenny? [Kenny stands motionless] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19060,Kyle,...Power. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19065,Kyle,Destroy it? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19151,Kyle,Liberace gay. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19225,Kyle,"Owatta Beikoku! [""Down with the U.S.A.!""] [the adults are stunned] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19227,Kyle,But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19229,Kyle,What? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19231,Kyle,"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19233,Kyle,So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19235,Kyle,"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. [moves forward] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19237,Kyle,"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. [turns the power off and hops out of the plane. Mr. Garrison walk away] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19243,Kyle,"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19267,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19273,Kyle,"What's a ""home-schooled kid""? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19303,Kyle,[softly] Wow! [he's impressed] 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19306,Kyle,What?? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19308,Kyle,Definition? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19310,Kyle,"Uh, could you use it in a sentence? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19312,Kyle,"""Krocsyldiphic."" "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19314,Kyle,"""Krocsyldiphic."" C [the buzzer cuts him off] Damnit! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19319,Kyle,"[walks up to Rebecca] What's your name? [apparently, he wasn't paying attention...] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19321,Kyle,Wooww. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19359,Kyle,"[Mrs. Cotswolds opens the door] Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19361,Kyle,"...Uuh, can I talk to her? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19364,Kyle,"U-u-uh, hi. [puts his hands behind his back] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19366,Kyle,"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. [turns and hurries away. Rebecca looks, then goes in. Her mom closes the door] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19445,Kyle,...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19449,Kyle,Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance! 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19455,Kyle,What?? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19461,Kyle,"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19477,Kyle,"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um, "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19479,Kyle,Huh? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19481,Kyle,"Uuuh, okay. [she yanks him in] Gah! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19495,Kyle,"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19497,Kyle,You will? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19499,Kyle,"No no. I mean, go with me. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19519,Kyle,You got my note? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19521,Kyle,"Uh, can we sit down? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19523,Kyle,"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... [draws close] flicker of light over there? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19525,Kyle,"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, [draws close] just like us. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19527,Kyle,"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. [they walk over to a stone bench and sit] Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19529,Kyle,"Love, for one thing. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19531,Kyle,"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19533,Kyle,When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19535,Kyle,"Rebecca, in public school, [hops down] we select our... own mate. [walks off a bit] In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19537,Kyle,I'm not completely sure. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19539,Kyle,"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. [she hums as they get closer and closer. Their lips touch. A quick kiss and they pull apart] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19541,Kyle,"Dah. [she kisses him back, then lets go] Does that mean you'll go to the dance? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19559,Kyle,[with a bouquet of flowers] I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19561,Kyle,"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19563,Kyle,You suck! 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19575,Kyle,Rebecca. You... 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19580,Kyle,Uh. All I did was show her how to- 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19582,Kyle,[landing on his back] Aaaah! 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19584,Kyle,Ooww! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19638,Kyle,"No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19644,Kyle,"Relax, fatass. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19660,Kyle,"You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19694,Kyle,Cartman! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19700,Kyle,"Good job, fatass! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19723,Kyle,"Why would anybody send this asshole money? [""-we go all around the world and-""] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19725,Kyle,"Yeh-hah. [They hear noise outside, and soon Marvin's ship crashes through the front wall of the house.] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19728,Kyle,Starvin' Marvin! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19730,Kyle,He did take a ship. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19735,Kyle,I think he wants us to get in. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19737,Kyle,Let's go somewhere. [Marvin pulls the ship out of Cartman's house and flies low over the ground] 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19740,Kyle,Yes! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19756,Kyle,"No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19763,Kyle,"Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! [the ship races into the wormhole] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19765,Kyle,[gasps] Where are we? 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19768,Kyle,This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19782,Kyle,[joins Marvin] Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19784,Kyle,"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19796,Kyle,"Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. [the Ethiopians all begin to speak] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19802,Kyle,"Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19804,Kyle,No! [agents rush in from all sides and some black helicopters appear over the space ship. Two FBI agents come and stand behind the boys.] 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19807,Kyle,"Oh, no, dude! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19823,Kyle,"[from the pants] I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19832,Kyle,Watch out! Here I come! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19834,Kyle,Kenny! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19843,Kyle,"Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19845,Kyle,"What was that? [the CBC's XT-9000 appears behind them. Inside, Sister Hollis is manning the bridge, with another woman and four men.] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19850,Kyle,"Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19852,Kyle,"Well, how'd we do it last time?? "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19854,Kyle,"Which button did you press, Cartman?? "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19856,Kyle,You don't remember?! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19889,Kyle,"Yeah, now finish 'em off! [a huge junker comes up behind and fires at them] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19891,Kyle,Where did that come from?? 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19898,Kyle,"Sorry, Marvin. We tried. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19916,Kyle,"It's pulling us in! [the junker and the Missionary 600 give chase. All three ships enter the wormhole, and all experience its warping effects.] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19920,Kyle,Marvin... [everyone talks at once] 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19932,Kyle,"[steps forward] Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19936,Kyle,Thanks. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19946,Kyle,"No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19960,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19962,Kyle,"Well, you have to hit it softer! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19964,Kyle,"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19968,Kyle,"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19972,Kyle,Cartman!!! [Cartman stops] 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19974,Kyle,"Give me the drum, and you play the flute. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19979,Kyle,You dick! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19985,Kyle,He'll show. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19992,Kyle,"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19996,Kyle,Yeah! You're dressed up like the South. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20001,Kyle,"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20003,Kyle,"No they're not, stupid! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20005,Kyle,How much do you wanna bet?! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20007,Kyle,"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20009,Kyle,And if the North wins you're our slave for a month?? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20011,Kyle,You're on! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20014,Kyle,Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20064,Kyle,What do we do?! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20082,Kyle,"You cheated, Cartman! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20084,Kyle,"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20114,Kyle,"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20139,Kyle,"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20146,Kyle,Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves?? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20148,Kyle,"We have to stop him, dude. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20151,Kyle,We'll give you 10 bucks. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20165,Kyle,"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20179,Kyle,Hey! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20201,Kyle,Yeah. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20219,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history. [Cartman eyes a phone...] You see, history is forever, [...and an empty schnapps case next to it] and everything happens for a reason. [Cartman turns and walks] Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno- "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20244,Kyle,We'll never stop them now. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20297,Kyle,"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20304,Kyle,"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20314,Kyle,Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! [tugs at it until it pulls off] 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20318,Kyle,"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20322,Kyle,What?? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20328,Kyle,"Yeah. Thanks, dick! "
3,15,Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics,20361,Kyle," Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. [picks it up] This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:   [begins to dance] I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay. And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play.

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20695,Kyle,I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives! 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20697,Kyle,"What, fatass?! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20704,Kyle,You got your what? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20710,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! [Miss Aliton turns and walks away. The boys turn to face Cartman] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20713,Kyle,"Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20754,Kyle,"Dude, did you get your period yet? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20756,Kyle,"Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20758,Kyle,Yeah. 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20766,Kyle,"You got your period too, Kenny? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20784,Kyle,"Ike, can I talk to you? [sits down next to Ike] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20786,Kyle,"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20788,Kyle,"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20790,Kyle,"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20792,Kyle,"[stands and moves out] Thanks a lot, Ike! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20801,Kyle,"[rushes up quite excited] You guys! I got my period, too! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20804,Kyle,"Yeah! [Stan looks down sadly] I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20806,Kyle,Awesome! We get powers? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20830,Kyle,[with bandana and leafy wings] Here.

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20839,Kyle,"Nothing. Um [clears his throat], my period is really uuuh... [Cartman looks on skeptically] Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20842,Kyle,[sighs] Phew.

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20905,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20916,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20942,Kyle,"[Butters is already next to Cartman] Hey, here comes Stan. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20945,Kyle,"Did you get your period yet, Stan? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20994,Kyle,[exposed] How do know that? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21008,Kyle,"[Kenny laughs] Shut up, fatass! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21038,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21042,Kyle,"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21044,Kyle,Nuh-uh! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21047,Kyle,"There is no brown noise, fat boy! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21077,Kyle,"[aside, to Stan] Who the hell are these guys? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21080,Kyle,"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21083,Kyle,Kenny? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21091,Kyle,"Alright, dickhole! [feedback is heard, and all look to the source] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21095,Kyle,"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! [drops his book] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21097,Kyle,"Well, let's try the dictionary. [picks it up] queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21101,Kyle,What's it mean?! What's it mean?! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21103,Kyle,Awwgh! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21132,Kyle,"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21134,Kyle,Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21136,Kyle,How about... finkleroy? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21140,Kyle,Mung's good. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21145,Kyle,"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21149,Kyle,Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! [they resume laughing] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21157,Kyle,[winces] Eewww. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21161,Kyle,"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21187,Kyle,What the hell is that lady talking about? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21225,Kyle,Yeah. They think they're so cool. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21227,Kyle,"Calm down, Cartman. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21232,Kyle,[removes his earmuffs] I don't believe it! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21235,Kyle,That's amazing. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21241,Kyle,"Yeah, dude! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21320,Kyle,We have to watch them! We can't miss it! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21322,Kyle,This is gonna be sweet! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21325,Kyle,"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time- "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21338,Kyle,"Well, that whole experience sure did suck. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21341,Kyle,Huh? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21348,Kyle,"Oh, no! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21350,Kyle,Huh? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21376,Kyle,He's fat and he's stupid? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21379,Kyle,No way! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21383,Kyle,I only got a jar of gefilte fish. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21385,Kyle,...Totally what? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21390,Kyle,"Me too. [Kenny says nothing, so the others look at him] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21392,Kyle,"You still have baby teeth, Kenny? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21399,Kyle,"[at the other end, tying the string to a wheelchair] Almost. You ready, Timmy? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21401,Kyle,"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21403,Kyle,Right. You're Timmy. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21408,Kyle,"Alright! Get ready, Timmy. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21421,Kyle,"[walks up to Stan] Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21426,Kyle,"Yeah, let's go. [the group begins to move when] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21428,Kyle,"No, Timmy, wait! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21443,Kyle,"Come on, fatass! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21459,Kyle,Did the tooth fairy come? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21462,Kyle,Four dollars? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21495,Kyle,No more money?? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21498,Kyle,"Cartman, what's going on?! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21502,Kyle,"What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?"" "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21505,Kyle,That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21507,Kyle,"[approaches] You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21509,Kyle,It's not true! [runs away] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21512,Kyle,"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21514,Kyle,[suddenly alarmed] Oh my God! You did lie to me. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21516,Kyle,"[looking aghast] Peter Pan, too?? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21518,Kyle,What about Moses and Abraham? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21520,Kyle,Probably?! Is Atlantis real?? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21522,Kyle,[frightened] Wahahahah! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21524,Kyle,"Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! [runs out the door] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21527,Kyle,What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21534,Kyle,All made up. Not real. Nothing's real. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21539,Kyle,"Oh my God, what if I'm not real? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21542,Kyle,"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21544,Kyle,What if this is all just somebody's dream? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21560,Kyle,Two years? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21599,Kyle,Cartman! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21649,Kyle,See ya. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21656,Kyle,"[still reading] Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21677,Kyle,"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21704,Kyle,"[to Stan] Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21714,Kyle,"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21716,Kyle,"But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? [the boys pass the Platter River] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21718,Kyle,"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down, [(Heeyy!!)] and my own existence fading. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21726,Kyle,"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. [Cartman opens the window and floats in grinning] Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! [begins to disappear] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21742,Kyle,"I am nothing, and everything. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21746,Kyle,Hunh. That was pretty weird. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21756,Kyle,"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21774,Kyle,Oh yeah?! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21785,Kyle,Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21792,Kyle,Fatass. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21873,Kyle,What the hell are they doing? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21876,Kyle,"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. [the camera zooms out to show two lines of police cars following closely behind Kenny and Cartman. At least 22 cars are shown] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21894,Kyle,"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. [The others look around at each other] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21898,Kyle,"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21901,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21904,Kyle,"[as the sled stops] Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21924,Kyle,"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! [Clyde glares back] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21932,Kyle,We killed Kenny? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21934,Kyle,"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21940,Kyle,If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21946,Kyle,How? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21948,Kyle,Sweet! Let's go! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21960,Kyle,"[he and Stan take their seats] Hey, fatass. How's prison? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21963,Kyle,"Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. [lowers his voice] So we made you this cake. [lifts it onto the counter, and it reads, ""Get Out Soon, Cartman""] There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21965,Kyle,[softly] An ailnay ilefay. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21967,Kyle,"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21970,Kyle,"They on'tday?! [takes the cake down] Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21973,Kyle,"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo- "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21984,Kyle,Me too. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21986,Kyle,"[""Don't fart on your way out you might make little smoke signals. [he and Stan laugh] ""]"
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21990,Kyle,So now what do we do? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22002,Kyle,"Dude, I didn't know Tolkien lived so far away. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22004,Kyle,Yeah. But isn't Tolkien the only one? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22009,Kyle,Killer. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22012,Kyle,"Well then, [Tolkien begins to move away. Kyle holds his shoulder, but moves with him. Stan follows] you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22017,Kyle,"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! [remembers where he is] Oh, sorry. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22019,Kyle,Huh? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22023,Kyle,Why not? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22048,Kyle,"I don't start, you start. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22051,Kyle,"And we think that that is [flips the page to reveal a copy of the title page] a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22055,Kyle,"[shows a rainbow of people holding hands] But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes [Stan flips the page to reveal their hate crime proposal]. For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we [flips the page to show them winning a sledding race] will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22083,Kyle,He's gotta show up. He's just got to. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22086,Kyle,"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22091,Kyle,"On the sled, fatass! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22107,Kyle,"Go, fatass! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22112,Kyle,Oh no! The girls are gonna win! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22121,Kyle,We won! We won! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22124,Kyle,"It's good to have you back, Cartman. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22148,Kyle,Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22159,Kyle,The Declaration of Independence? 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22219,Kyle,Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22256,Kyle,...I am eight. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22285,Kyle,No way! [Timmy says something incomprehensible] 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22298,Kyle,He looks pretty happy to me. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22312,Kyle,"Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy? "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22328,Kyle,We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22331,Kyle,"That's correct, Chef. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22333,Kyle,"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22338,Kyle,"No, not at all. [Cartman looks away and a Christina Aguilera monster appears] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22358,Kyle,"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? [has the bottle out. Mr. Garrison thinks a bit, then goes for the bottle, opens it up, and chugs some pills down] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22400,Kyle,"Yes, let's. [Cartman starts channel-surfing, then stops] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22406,Kyle,You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22409,Kyle,Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22413,Kyle,Bastard. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22433,Kyle,"Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22436,Kyle,Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22438,Kyle,"Come, see him with us. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22479,Kyle,Yeah. [the monster munches loudly on Cartman] 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22484,Kyle,Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo! 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22489,Kyle,Yeah! 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22492,Kyle,Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22522,Kyle,Awwww! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22538,Kyle,How long does this thing last? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22545,Kyle,"Whoa. [a few twirls, and the middle one is thrust into the air. The two girls on the outside leap up and land on the other two's heads and catch the middle girl, to form a pentagon. Then they form a large cat, then a yacht,...] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22552,Kyle,Those contorting Romanian chicks rule. 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22554,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22559,Kyle,"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22562,Kyle,Let's go practice. [they exit] 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22583,Kyle,It's Kenny's singing! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22650,Kyle,"What?! [they all turn, and the quints stand before them] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22657,Kyle,"What's a ""quin-tuplet""? "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22659,Kyle,But there's only four of you. 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22662,Kyle,"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike? "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22697,Kyle,How can you say that? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22699,Kyle,"Oh, yeah! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22742,Kyle,"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22746,Kyle,"[the girls look at him] You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22786,Kyle,Alright! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22790,Kyle,"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now?? "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22844,Kyle,"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22899,Kyle,Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22916,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card. [tosses it in front of him] You lose a turn. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22919,Kyle,What? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22921,Kyle,AIDS?! [looks confused] 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22930,Kyle,What? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22932,Kyle,"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22993,Kyle,"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines. [elderly people are seen hooked up to them] Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22995,Kyle,"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this. [plants his lips wide on the glass and blows out] Waaaaah! [as the seal takes hold, his cheeks puff up and the inside of his his mouth shows clearly — it is a blow face. Stan smiles] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22997,Kyle,[makes the blow face and wags his tongue at the patients] Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23004,Kyle,"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23059,Kyle,"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23063,Kyle,"What are you talking about, fatass? "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23115,Kyle,They are? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23119,Kyle,We don't wanna go! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23121,Kyle,We don't WANNA go! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23124,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23151,Kyle,"Yeah. [yells] HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH? "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23194,Kyle,Dude. Being mature is boring! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23200,Kyle,"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! [music resumes. All the boys turn and head for the stairs, only to see shadows moving up the wall, and they stop in their tracks] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23226,Kyle,[panting] Dude! We're surrounded by perverts. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23233,Kyle,How? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23253,Kyle,Dude. You have sex with children. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23255,Kyle,"[slowly, for emphasis] Dude. You have sex with children. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23257,Kyle,Seriously. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23259,Kyle,"Well, Cartman? "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23261,Kyle,Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23330,Kyle,"I don't know, I... "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23429,Kyle,How much? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23609,Kyle,"Better, thanks. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23612,Kyle,"Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23625,Kyle,Oh. ...Thanks? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23628,Kyle,[white liquid spurts out his nose] Huh? [covers his nose] What the? 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23651,Kyle,Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23658,Kyle,Told ya. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23664,Kyle,"Yeah, we got it. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23710,Kyle,"Yeah, me neither. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23721,Kyle,Not really. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23788,Kyle,"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want. [Kenny chows down tablets from a blue bowl before him] Who wants to read them? [no one responds] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23790,Kyle,"Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23792,Kyle,"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23795,Kyle,"Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23797,Kyle,"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. [Kenny hops off and walks to the dispenser] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23800,Kyle,"Pretty good, I guess. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23803,Kyle,"Kenny ate all the mints, dad. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23805,Kyle,Oh. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23935,Kyle,"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill. [an astonished Stan looks as Cartman puts his right hand on the back of Wendy's chair and points at her with his left, winks, then does a victory hand dance. A smiling Wendy remains oblivious to this showing off] And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. [returns to his seat amid a smattering of applause] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23937,Kyle,Huh? 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23943,Kyle,W-we really didn't see it that way. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23945,Kyle,"Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23954,Kyle,"Yeah. [Cartman is still showing off, Wendy remains oblivious, Stan remains shocked] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23961,Kyle,"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now. [waves his hand in front of Stan to get his attention] Stan? "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23965,Kyle,"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23986,Kyle,...How? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23990,Kyle,I'm not being in any [crosses his arms over his chest] faggy boy band! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23996,Kyle,Wait a minute. There's only four of us. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23998,Kyle,"So, all boy bands have five members. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24000,Kyle,"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24022,Kyle,It was? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24027,Kyle,I promised my mom I'd let him try. [Ike hops in with some sheet music] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24040,Kyle,"Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24044,Kyle,"Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24049,Kyle,Me too. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24061,Kyle,[dryly] I wanna be the tough one. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24063,Kyle,[determined] I wanna be the tough one! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24065,Kyle,Jews are tough! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24067,Kyle,"Since Abraham, fatass! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24085,Kyle,Jesus Christ! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24126,Kyle,Wow. I feel so rejected. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24131,Kyle,Run for it! [the five bolt and rush out of there] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24163,Kyle,"Dude, what's wrong with your leg? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24284,Kyle,Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. [the band regroups] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24286,Kyle,He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24292,Kyle,Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24317,Kyle,It's Stan! [the other members have returned] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24319,Kyle,"Dude, where the hell have you been?! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24325,Kyle,You bastards! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24327,Kyle,"Dude, he's pretty dead. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24331,Kyle,"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24338,Kyle,We made two dollars. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24347,Kyle,Yeah. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24349,Kyle,...Yeah. That's gonna suck. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24353,Kyle,"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? [gets up and follows the others off the stage. Cartman gets up and follows him] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24488,Kyle,"[stops by] Hey, dudes. What are you doin'? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24490,Kyle,Uhwuwhat? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24492,Kyle,No-o-o-o-o! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24494,Kyle,Oh good. I don't? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24496,Kyle,I am not! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24499,Kyle,I'm gonna go ask my mom! [walks away] 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24580,Kyle,[rushes into the room] Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24582,Kyle,"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24584,Kyle,We don't? But what if we're wrong? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24586,Kyle,"Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24590,Kyle,"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! [goes up to him and takes him away towards the front door. The book falls to the floor] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24610,Kyle,[rushes in with Ike in tow] Mister Father! [Sister Anne looks back at him] We have to ask you something. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24612,Kyle,"Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24621,Kyle,[breathless] Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24626,Kyle,HAAAAH! 
4,10,Probably,24742,Kyle,But what if we're wrong? 
4,10,Probably,24776,Kyle,"Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever. "
4,10,Probably,24820,Kyle,"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks! "
4,10,Probably,24822,Kyle,"Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith! "
4,10,Probably,24844,Kyle,[moves next to Stan] Ask him what hell is like. 
4,10,Probably,24957,Kyle,Yes! 
4,10,Probably,24959,Kyle,Yes! 
4,10,Probably,24961,Kyle,[angrily] Ow! [rubs his right temple and cheek while Cartman talks] 
4,10,Probably,24963,Kyle,"[softens] Uh, I think so. "
4,10,Probably,25036,Kyle,Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this. 
4,10,Probably,25065,Kyle,You're keeping that money yourself? 
4,10,Probably,25071,Kyle,[points] Then why didn't you tell us?! 
4,10,Probably,25073,Kyle,The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass! 
4,10,Probably,25107,Kyle,"Serves you right, Cartman! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25140,Kyle,Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! [two older boys come up behind Stan and Kyle and punch them to the floor. A third 5th-grader arrives. Stan and Kyle look up.] 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25142,Kyle,"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25144,Kyle,"[rises with Stan] Ungh, gay, dude. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25153,Kyle,"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25156,Kyle,"He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! [Pip arrives, then Craig, then Wendy and Bebe] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25165,Kyle,...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25167,Kyle,Together we are strong! [raises fists] 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25173,Kyle,"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom? "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25178,Kyle,"Holy God, dude! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25182,Kyle,Yeah! [starts chuckling] 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25194,Kyle,And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25198,Kyle,I just didn't think it would come so soon. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25200,Kyle,Huh? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25202,Kyle,Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25206,Kyle,How? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25208,Kyle,"Oh yeah, time travel. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25212,Kyle,"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25220,Kyle,So can you do it? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25252,Kyle,"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25271,Kyle,Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25273,Kyle,Come on! [the other kids scramble out of their chairs and rush outside] 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25280,Kyle,What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25282,Kyle,[with trembling voice] No?? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25311,Kyle,Oh no! What have we done?! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25383,Kyle,"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25392,Kyle,Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25418,Kyle,Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25420,Kyle,"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25482,Kyle,"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25484,Kyle,"Yeah! You suck, Cartman! [the kids return to their seats, leaving Cartman alone] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25488,Kyle,"Hey, Timmy's back! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25506,Kyle,Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25508,Kyle,"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25510,Kyle,"[moves Ike aside and shows his folder] But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper. [opens it up and displays the inside] It has five different compartments for each subject in school, [closes it and shows off the covers] and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25514,Kyle,"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25516,Kyle,He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25519,Kyle,"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought-- "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25521,Kyle,"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! [music continues, and the bus rolls up] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25527,Kyle,You are? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25536,Kyle,I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25538,Kyle,"No, I don't! I don't care! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25561,Kyle,"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25563,Kyle,I'm gonna! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25565,Kyle,I will! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25596,Kyle,[angry] Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25623,Kyle,"Whoa, dude..! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25636,Kyle,"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25667,Kyle,That should do it. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25674,Kyle,"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25680,Kyle,"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25685,Kyle,Hey! What are you doing? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25687,Kyle,Oh... Okay. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25695,Kyle,"Yeah, that'd be faster. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25730,Kyle,Here we go again. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25739,Kyle,"[in the hallway, pounds on the door] Dammit, Cartman, open up! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25743,Kyle,"Cartman? [inside, cables wrap tight around his face and go in, transforming his body into a grotesque hybrid, and the hybrid begins to grow] He's not gonna open it. Break it down. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25745,Kyle,"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25749,Kyle,You ba--! [the boys make a run for it down the hall and down the stairs as the Trapper Keeper oozes out of Cartman's room] 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25768,Kyle,Why is that bad? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25771,Kyle,"Step on it, Bill Cosby! [""Bill"" starts the cruiser and drives off] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25781,Kyle,"Not-- Aw, damnit..! [walks up to the hissing hose and climbs in] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25784,Kyle,"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25786,Kyle,"Screw you, fat ass! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25788,Kyle,Cartman! [hits a wall with a wrench] 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25790,Kyle,No! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25806,Kyle,I can't reach the CPU. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25818,Kyle,Got 'em! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25849,Kyle,"I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25859,Kyle,Can we take a lunch break now? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25867,Kyle,"What is it, Butters? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25872,Kyle,We can't be outdone by the kindergartners! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25876,Kyle,Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25883,Kyle,Okay! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25888,Kyle,"A smart one, that can do tricks. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25893,Kyle,"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25896,Kyle,"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25898,Kyle,"Alright, we'll take him. How much? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25900,Kyle,But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25902,Kyle,"[thinks] ...God-damnit, here! [the rancher takes the money, walks over to get the turkey, and delivers the turkey to Timmy] Alright, Timmy, let's go! [Kyle and Timmy leave] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25904,Kyle,"Aw, blow it out your ass! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25913,Kyle,It's a turkey. [long pause] His name is Gobbles. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25916,Kyle,"Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one... "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25919,Kyle,I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25921,Kyle,"[the rest of the cast approaches] Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25963,Kyle,"Timmy, we already got a turkey. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25967,Kyle,"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25997,Kyle,What Butters? [Butters meets the others onstage] 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26056,Kyle,So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26058,Kyle,"You ready for the big show, Timmy? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26062,Kyle,"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26099,Kyle,"He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26133,Kyle,"[steps forward and points] Hey, look! [onstage, Gobbles approaches the ring of fire and steps through it. The kids grin immediately] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26140,Kyle,"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26147,Kyle,Butters told us their play was awesome! [the kids move away from Butters a bit] 
4,15,Fat Camp,26449,Kyle,"Aw, don't be such a baby! [takes the knife, blinks, then offers it to Kenny] You do it, Kenny. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26451,Kyle,"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26489,Kyle,"[working on his manatee] Aw, dude, check this out. [pulls out the spleen with some scissors] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26491,Kyle,"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26493,Kyle,I'll give you ten bucks to eat it. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26501,Kyle,"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26532,Kyle,[walks up with Butters] What's the matter? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26534,Kyle,Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. [Stan jumps back as Kenny starts vomiting the spleen up. Stan and Kyle watch in shock] 
4,15,Fat Camp,26537,Kyle,"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen! [Butters looks at him] How much, Kenny? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26539,Kyle,I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26545,Kyle,"That's 19 bucks, Kenny! [more kids gather] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26549,Kyle,"Kick ass, dude! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26551,Kyle,Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26591,Kyle,Whoa! [the others look stunned] 
4,15,Fat Camp,26597,Kyle,What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26601,Kyle,Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26603,Kyle,Good point. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26619,Kyle,[he and Stan look at Jesus for a moment] Huh? Why not? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26625,Kyle,I don't know. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26643,Kyle,Why? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26685,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? [takes a donut] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26748,Kyle,"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26750,Kyle,Six hours. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26752,Kyle,Great. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26754,Kyle,For what? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26758,Kyle,Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26760,Kyle,"[sits next to the new Cartman. Stan sits by Kyle's other side] He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26762,Kyle,"...Alright, that does it! [rises and backs up a bit] This has been bothering the hell out of me! [reaches for the new Cartman's cap and pulls it off, revealing a puffy head of hair. Stan registers shock] I knew it! You're not Cartman at all! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26770,Kyle,"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26772,Kyle,"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26810,Kyle,Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26813,Kyle,"Come on. Throw the football, Ike. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26816,Kyle,Hepatitis B? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26818,Kyle,...You got Raging Pussies tickets?? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26820,Kyle,[withdraws] Hold on. I'll be right back. [turns and runs into the house] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26822,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26824,Kyle,But all the guys are going! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26826,Kyle,"But Mom, I- "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26828,Kyle,Ugh! [turns right and walks out] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26830,Kyle,My parents said I can't go. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26834,Kyle,"[looks down] Ah. Oh, now I already told them. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26836,Kyle,No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. [turns and runs back into the house. Ike finally throws the football off and looks out from the snow] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26838,Kyle,"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26840,Kyle,What's Cuba? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26842,Kyle,"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26844,Kyle,"Hoh, geez. [walks away] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26846,Kyle,Dear Mr. Castro: My name is Kyle. [thinks] I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26848,Kyle," And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world, If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change. [Castro sees a drawing of a sad Kyle holding a flower, which fades to a sad Kyle writing his letter] Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea [Kyle finishes a drawing of a sad rainbow coalition atop a world globe] Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free [Castro see a drawing of a sad Kyle inside a small house] I just can't be very happy, that's certain [A picture of Kyle replaces his self-portrait on the paper] Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' [Kyle finishes one last drawing of himself, which Castro sees last] Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind? That is my one and only wish.   "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26852,Kyle,[exults] I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26854,Kyle,"[wounded, turns] What?? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26856,Kyle,"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26858,Kyle,But that's not fair! You lied to me! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26860,Kyle,What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26862,Kyle,"Well I wish I didn't have any parents! [walks to the front door, opens it, and exits, shocking Gerald and Sheila] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26865,Kyle,It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26867,Kyle,They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26869,Kyle,How?! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26873,Kyle,What's that? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26875,Kyle,[awed] Wow! Three months without parents! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26878,Kyle,Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26880,Kyle,"[straight] ""My parents molestered me."" "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26882,Kyle,"What's ""bad touch""? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26884,Kyle,"Okay, molestered, bad touch. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26893,Kyle,"Cool, thanks. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26906,Kyle,...Nothing. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26908,Kyle,Not one adult left? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27017,Kyle,[emerges from the group and stands next to Stan] Yeah. [these two head Treasure Cove] 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27021,Kyle,The fatass. The mayor. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27025,Kyle,"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27078,Kyle,"Sure, outlander. I'll get it [starts to move...] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27115,Kyle,Parents. Mom. Dad. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27119,Kyle,Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27123,Kyle,"Here's our cell phone, dude. [hands it to Mark] Will you call the police for us? [Mark begins dialing] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27129,Kyle,Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27133,Kyle,Did you make it to your job interview? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27137,Kyle,"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27140,Kyle,Mom! Dad! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27144,Kyle,Yeah. We're fine. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27146,Kyle,But you didn't do anything to me. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27149,Kyle,"[lags] But, you guys, I-- "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27157,Kyle,Huh. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27160,Kyle,Sure. [the boys turn left and start walking] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27163,Kyle,"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27165,Kyle,"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike. [lifts him off the seat and takes him back to the night stand] Come sit by me. [they sit down and face the toilet bowl, and wait. Nothing happens.] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27167,Kyle,"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27169,Kyle,"Happy Chanukah, Mom. [returns his sight to the toilet bowl and waits...] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27172,Kyle,Go away! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27176,Kyle,[barks. Music stops] Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27179,Kyle,"Okay, good. You're all here. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27181,Kyle,It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27183,Kyle,"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27185,Kyle,"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27188,Kyle,"[turns and glares at Cartman] Dude, you sneezed on my back! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27190,Kyle,"Hey, look. [before them is a small cottage in a collection basin. They walk to the end of the sewer line] Hello? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27192,Kyle,"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that- "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27194,Kyle,But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27210,Kyle,A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27215,Kyle,Sure we'll help! [Stan grins] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27242,Kyle,"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27246,Kyle,"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it! [drops down from the sofa and walks to the TV] It's so simple! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27248,Kyle,"[turns and faces the other boys] We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! [Charlie and Linus talk onscreen] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27250,Kyle,How hard can it be? Look at it. [Snoopy and Charlie walk in the woods] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27258,Kyle,[as the boys enter]Mayor! We have the solution to your problem. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27260,Kyle,We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27266,Kyle,[to the other three] You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27269,Kyle,"[now facing the house from the sewer] Ah, Mr. Hankey? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27271,Kyle,"[excited] We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27276,Kyle,"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. [turns and walks away...] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27280,Kyle,"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27288,Kyle,"They kind of look like us. [the poster is shown again] I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27290,Kyle,"God job, Butters. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27293,Kyle,"See ya! [grabs Santa, Cartman grabs Jesus, and they walk away with Kenny] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27323,Kyle,"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. [they walk over to some microphones.] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27325,Kyle,What's a hard p? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27327,Kyle,"Oh, yeah. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27331,Kyle," We wish-   [the sound man presses a few buttons, and some white noise blasts through the boys' headphones] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27337,Kyle,What? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27339,Kyle,"Well, yes, I think so. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27341,Kyle," Dreidel dreidel dreidel, I made you out of clay, Dreidel dreidel dreidel--   "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27343,Kyle,"[throws his headphones off and faces Cartman angrily] Don't you oppress me, fat boy. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27345,Kyle,Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27353,Kyle,"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27355,Kyle,Yeah. So what's the first syllable? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27357,Kyle,"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads. [sets the ""woo"" mouths in place] And then we shoot that for one frame. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27359,Kyle,That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! [exults] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27361,Kyle,"Now, the next mouth. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27363,Kyle,"Okay, where are the E-mouths? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27366,Kyle,"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27368,Kyle,So how much done is that? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27370,Kyle,"[softly] Aw, [loudly] Jesus Christ! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27391,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. [Cartman sneezes and immediately realizes what he just did] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27393,Kyle,Cartman! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27397,Kyle,[rushing to the door] Fine! We'll do it with out you! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27399,Kyle,We'll dub his voice over. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27401,Kyle," Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.  To people like you, and me. But don't expect a miracle. Unless you help make it to be.  You hope, and I'll hurry. [takes the poster and rolls it up.] You pray, and I'll plan [The boys exit the Photo Dojo with it] We'll do what's necessary, 'cause [now in Stan's room, works on a Brian Boitano cutout] Even a miracle needs a hand! [walks up to the wall and adds a scene to Act II]   "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27402,Kyle, You love-   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27404,Kyle, -And I'll labor. [takes down the scene]   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27406,Kyle, You sit- [puts it up again]   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27408,Kyle, -And I'll stand. [a funny look appears on his face]   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27413,Kyle,"You can do Cartman's voice, can't you? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27415,Kyle,"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27417,Kyle,Cool! Now let's try the script! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27420,Kyle,"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27423,Kyle, You wish-   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27425,Kyle, -And I'll whittle.   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27427,Kyle, You sit- [closes the box and tosses it up]   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27429,Kyle, -And I'll stand. [displays the box's destination and walks out with it]   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27431,Kyle," [with Kenny humming] Let's all try to help a little, 'cause[A group of 20 Korean inbetweeners are shown working hard on the short]   "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27440,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27443,Kyle,"Okay, Mr. Hankey! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27448,Kyle,What? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27450,Kyle,"Yeah, I think so. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27452,Kyle, What? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27454,Kyle, Dreidel dreidel dreidel-   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27463,Kyle,All that hard work. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27465,Kyle,But we spent it! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27468,Kyle,All that work! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27471,Kyle,"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27486,Kyle,What the-- 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27489,Kyle,They did it! They got it working! [closes the door behind him] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27501,Kyle,...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27507,Kyle,"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27510,Kyle,What? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27512,Kyle,[softly] Ah. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27514,Kyle,Yeah. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27524,Kyle,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27530,Kyle,"[to Stan] Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27536,Kyle,[joining the two other boys] Hey you guys! Look what I have! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27538,Kyle,Four tickets to The Lion King on stage! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27540,Kyle,"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27543,Kyle,"What, doughboy? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27547,Kyle,What? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27549,Kyle,What?! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27553,Kyle,"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27556,Kyle,"[gasps] They're gonna say ""shit"" on television? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27562,Kyle,Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27565,Kyle,It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27567,Kyle,It's stupid! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27569,Kyle,"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27581,Kyle,"Hey, Butters! [Butters turns to see Kyle, and the tag is shown: ""Butters""] I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite [points] YOU before anybody else. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27583,Kyle,How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27616,Kyle,[stops and looks back] I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27618,Kyle,I don't really give a fuck! [turns and walks away] 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27639,Kyle,Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27641,Kyle,"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?! [moves from one end of the sofa to the other] Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world? [moves towards the front door] It's still the same old world out there. Look. [opens the door to find frogs raining down on the neighborhood. The other boys soon join him] What the hell? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27643,Kyle,"Oh, whatever. [steps back inside] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27651,Kyle,This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27663,Kyle,"[angrily] It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27665,Kyle,There's no sand in my vagina!!! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27702,Kyle,"You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, ""shit""! I think it might have something to do with people dying! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27704,Kyle,"Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27706,Kyle,"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"". "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27709,Kyle,"Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! [They walk past Shit Shack, and one of the knights steps out of the store as they leave. He sniffs a teal shirt with the word ""shit"" in his right hand.] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27730,Kyle,"Chef, do you know where ""shit"" comes from? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27732,Kyle,"[holds his left palm out] No no! The word, ""shit"". "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27735,Kyle,"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"". "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27743,Kyle,"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27749,Kyle,A... curse word. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27753,Kyle,"Cartman, this is serious!!! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27758,Kyle,"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! [Kenny goes under the weather and coughs. The others look] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27762,Kyle,"We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network, [the lead knight looks into the library from the bushes] ""shit"" will become an even more acceptable word! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27767,Kyle,"Cartman, stop being an asshole! [camera pans left to the lead knight sitting between two men, reading from THE WORLD NEWS. The knight lowers the paper and looks over at the boys, then sips from his coffee cup] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27785,Kyle,"We think that you might have caused it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. [the executives just stare back at him] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27787,Kyle,"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27789,Kyle,...No. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27815,Kyle,Now what? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27822,Kyle,We need some help identifying an ancient English stone. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27881,Kyle,And asshole. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27905,Kyle,Wait! [the Geldon lets loose another blast of fire] 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27910,Kyle,It's okay. The curse has been lifted. [the audience falls silent. Kyle and Stan are on stage.] 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27912,Kyle,"You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27914,Kyle,We're all saying the S-word too much! [Ike hops in] 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27919,Kyle,"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28258,Kyle,"That's pretty cool, dude! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28260,Kyle,"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28275,Kyle,"Wow, that's cool! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28280,Kyle,Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28282,Kyle,"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28295,Kyle,[thinking] I'm not really happy. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28297,Kyle,[thinking] My potential hasn't even been reached. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28305,Kyle,[rushes in with Blaine's book] Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28307,Kyle,"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four.... "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28309,Kyle,"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28322,Kyle,[behind Butters] You're Stan? Where's Kenny? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28324,Kyle,I'm Kyle. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28327,Kyle,[steps back to join Stan] What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28329,Kyle,But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28344,Kyle,What are we doing? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28346,Kyle,"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28348,Kyle,"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28350,Kyle,Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28352,Kyle,I'm not going anywhere! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28354,Kyle,Huh? I thought you wanted to leave. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28356,Kyle,You're Stan. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28358,Kyle,Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. [turns and walks back to his room. Stan turns back to face the hall and watched Kyle walk away] 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28360,Kyle,"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. [opens the door to his room and walks in. Stan looks, then turns towards the exit and walks out] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28362,Kyle,"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28365,Kyle,That's right. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28371,Kyle,"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28375,Kyle,David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night. [closes his book] We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28377,Kyle,How many tickets can we put you down for? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28389,Kyle,Great! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28391,Kyle,That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28393,Kyle,"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- [they reach the corner. Facing them on the opposite corner is Stan, standing by his bike] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28417,Kyle,This is a really good turnout. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28421,Kyle,"Dude, no way! [two female Blaintology assistants rush up and help Blaine stand. One has a little cage, another has a small curtain and rod. The one to his right places the cage where the head would be, while the one on the left places the curtain in front. A few seconds later, Blaine's head is back on his shoulders. The audience cheers] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28454,Kyle,"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28457,Kyle,Yeah. Why is that good news? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28459,Kyle,Mass suicide? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28480,Kyle,"[whispering] Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28482,Kyle,It's just me. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28484,Kyle,Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28486,Kyle,"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28488,Kyle,"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28490,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, you're right. [goes down the ladder to his own bunk, underneath Cartman's, and Cartman turns over to sleep] Oh uh Cartman: thanks. [goes to sleep. Later, he wakes up inside a large domed platform. Reflections of five adult Blaintologists and Cartman can be seen on the glass dome. He sits up and blinks] Cartman? [He tries to move, but encounters the glass. He taps to make sure] What the hell? [Camera pulls back to reveal...] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28493,Kyle,"What have you done, Cartman?! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28497,Kyle,"[knocking on the dome] Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28528,Kyle,"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28530,Kyle,"Cartman, no! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28548,Kyle,[off-screen] You bastards! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28550,Kyle,[off-screen] You bastards! [Stan looks up and follows Kyle's voice] 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28559,Kyle,Stan! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28561,Kyle,"I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! [tremulous footsteps are felt, and Lincoln is shown walking among the crowd of Blaintologists] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28587,Kyle,Wagh. [sits up] 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28602,Kyle,Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28605,Kyle,"[moves away so Stan can have a turn] Haha, hehahaha. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28611,Kyle,"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass? [Cartman gets off his bike] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28615,Kyle,...What the hell are you talking about? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28618,Kyle,"What's ""pubes""? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28620,Kyle,Oh. [to Cartman] No you didn't! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28624,Kyle,[turns to look at them] Hell no! [Stan and Kenny turn to look] 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28628,Kyle,"[approaches] Uh, what are those? [Stan and Kenny follow] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28632,Kyle,Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28636,Kyle,"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28640,Kyle,Yuh huh! 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28642,Kyle,"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28644,Kyle,Yeah. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28676,Kyle,"Cartman, can I give you some advice? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28678,Kyle,"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count your losses and move on. He's smarter than you. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28680,Kyle,One please. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28765,Kyle,"Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28769,Kyle,What's in it for us? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28840,Kyle,"Okay, Cartman, what do you want? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28844,Kyle,"[rolls his eyes] Oh, Jesus! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28846,Kyle,"Okay, so what's the plan? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28850,Kyle,...What? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28852,Kyle,"You're such a dumbass, Cartman. [he and Stan turn and walk away] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28862,Kyle,[voice at other end] Scott Tenorman? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28864,Kyle,"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28866,Kyle,"'Cause, we're his friends. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28868,Kyle,'Cause we hate him. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28870,Kyle,"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28909,Kyle,"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. [looks at Stan, who's smiling] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28913,Kyle,"Yeah, sure. [As Chef arrives, Stan and Kyle leave] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28958,Kyle,"Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28964,Kyle,"Okay, dude, it's 3:30. [Cartman changes the channel] "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28971,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28991,Kyle,Oh my God! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28995,Kyle,Write the number down! Write the number down!! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28998,Kyle,"I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29009,Kyle,What?? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29014,Kyle,Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29021,Kyle,"[fielding] Uhuh, but that's why we're going. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29023,Kyle,"See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29028,Kyle,"[the boys look sufficiently scared] Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29032,Kyle,"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29045,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip? "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29067,Kyle,We have to talk to Terrance. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29078,Kyle,"Hey! Look at that line! [a post next to it reads ""FEMALE GROUPIES AND OTHER RANDOM SLUTS"" An obese woman stands last in line] It's way shorter. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29081,Kyle,"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on. [moves to the other line. His friends follow.] Sshh. [stretches the fat woman's pants enough so that all four of them climb in and disappear under her fat] "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29107,Kyle,"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29111,Kyle,"Phillip, your partner. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29113,Kyle,But the guy who replaced him sucks! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29120,Kyle,[pleading] But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29129,Kyle,"Uuuh, we didn't get them. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29133,Kyle,"Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29137,Kyle,"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29175,Kyle,"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29178,Kyle,"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."" "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29183,Kyle,"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29185,Kyle,"[silent for a bit, then] Ih-it'll be okay. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29188,Kyle,They said they'd come. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29194,Kyle,He's here! [Stan and Cartman smile] 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29200,Kyle,Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29204,Kyle,"Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day. [moves his left forearm, palm out, from right to left] You care about Mother Earth, don't you? "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29208,Kyle,See? I told you it would work. [the boys take their places before the committee] 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29222,Kyle,You can't leave! The show starts soon! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29225,Kyle,You bastards! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29233,Kyle,"Hooray for the earth! We must protect it. [the crowd nose dies down] And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! [Stan hands a tape to a camera man, who puts it into a VCR and starts it.] "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29238,Kyle,"Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29262,Kyle,"Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29264,Kyle,"I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29267,Kyle,Haaah! [Carl chops off Kenny's left leg to the knee] 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29297,Kyle,"Wait! dude, LOOK! [the audience cheers as Terrance and Phillip take the stage] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29344,Kyle,"""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"" "
5,6,Cartmanland,29346,Kyle,"""Have mercy!"" [Stan lights the firework. He and Kyle move away. The firework pops and the little car flips over] Yeah ha ha! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29351,Kyle,Nuh uh. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29369,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing, fatass?! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29372,Kyle,Kenny wasn't lying. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29376,Kyle,Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29378,Kyle,"No... No, this isn't possible. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29380,Kyle,"No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29382,Kyle,Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29402,Kyle,"[not turning around, voice quivering] Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29404,Kyle,"[leaves the pew to face Stan, teary-eyed] Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense! [to God] What is your logic?! [feels a pang in his ass] Ow. [tends to the pain] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29410,Kyle,Great. [tosses the ring onto the sofa] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29412,Kyle,It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid. [hops onto the ring] Ow. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29414,Kyle,"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29416,Kyle,"Hunh, I guess you're right. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29419,Kyle,Where are we going? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29423,Kyle,"[in the distance, while Cartman speaks] Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts! [the sound of chain-link is heard] Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29425,Kyle,Hohohooho! Oowwww! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29429,Kyle,"[bawling] Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29432,Kyle,"Oh God, get me off of here!! [falls off, but outside the park] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29434,Kyle,"[now standing, rubbing his ass and wailing] Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29438,Kyle,My life can't get any worse! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29458,Kyle,Lucky. [the operating room doors open and in walks Stan] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29461,Kyle,"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29465,Kyle,"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29467,Kyle,"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29469,Kyle,No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God![Stan casts his eyes down] Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29507,Kyle,Agh! [the nurse moves the pincers one way] Agghh! [then another] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29510,Kyle,[the nurse leaves] Awesome. [Gerald and Sheila take their seats near Kyle] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29512,Kyle,I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29517,Kyle,[still mad] Satan talked to God? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29528,Kyle,[a few seconds later] And that's it? That's the end? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29530,Kyle,That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29532,Kyle,"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29552,Kyle,Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... [passes out. A flatline appears on the heart monitor] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29603,Kyle,[opens his eyes] Huh? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29605,Kyle,[more alert] Huh? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29617,Kyle,You are up there! [smiles] 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29620,Kyle,"[face appears] ""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."" "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29622,Kyle,"[fakes a cry] ""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"" "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29624,Kyle,"""AAAAAAAH!"" [the doll's head begins to melt and shrivel, then Stan removes the magnifying glass] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29630,Kyle,"What's this all about, Kenny? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29635,Kyle,No they don't! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29639,Kyle,That's awesome! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29643,Kyle,"You ""beat off?"" "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29713,Kyle,"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29716,Kyle,Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29719,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong with them? [the boys move towards the girls, who now have their backs against the far wall] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29728,Kyle,No. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29731,Kyle,Nuh uh. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29735,Kyle,Is that what you learned in sex ed? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29741,Kyle,"Oh my God, dude. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29749,Kyle,Yeah. Quick! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29754,Kyle,Well why not? You want us to get AIDS? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29767,Kyle,"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29798,Kyle,"Uh, what are ""studzes"" "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29804,Kyle,It says you gotta check it for holes or tears. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29808,Kyle,Sure. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29846,Kyle,Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29855,Kyle,"You mean, intercourse with a girl? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29860,Kyle,"Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29881,Kyle,Yeah! You get out of town! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29886,Kyle,"[to Stan] Man, he's pretty good. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29951,Kyle,Seventeen? [Sheila and Gerald approach] 
5,8,Towelie,29963,Kyle,HA! I killed you! 
5,8,Towelie,29967,Kyle,"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what? "
5,8,Towelie,29970,Kyle,"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing "
5,8,Towelie,29973,Kyle,"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash? "
5,8,Towelie,29985,Kyle,"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh? "
5,8,Towelie,29989,Kyle,Cool! 
5,8,Towelie,29993,Kyle,"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM. "
5,8,Towelie,29995,Kyle,"Don't know, but it kicks ass. [they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her] Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park. "
5,8,Towelie,29999,Kyle,"Awesome! [suddenly remembers] Oh, crap. "
5,8,Towelie,30001,Kyle,I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun. 
5,8,Towelie,30003,Kyle,"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. [a strange character walks up next to them] "
5,8,Towelie,30008,Kyle,"Thanks, Towelie. "
5,8,Towelie,30011,Kyle,"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games. "
5,8,Towelie,30016,Kyle,"Okay, turn it on. "
5,8,Towelie,30021,Kyle,"Oh, this is so cool. "
5,8,Towelie,30030,Kyle,"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- [to Cartman] wha-what is it? "
5,8,Towelie,30032,Kyle,"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. [hangs up] I don't have to go outside! "
5,8,Towelie,30034,Kyle,"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.. "
5,8,Towelie,30039,Kyle,Uh no. 
5,8,Towelie,30043,Kyle,No we don't wanna get high! 
5,8,Towelie,30054,Kyle,Me too. 
5,8,Towelie,30061,Kyle,"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid. "
5,8,Towelie,30066,Kyle,What? You mean Towelie? [the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio] 
5,8,Towelie,30072,Kyle,"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! [the boys burst in and head for the television] "
5,8,Towelie,30074,Kyle,Where is it? 
5,8,Towelie,30076,Kyle,Where the hell is it?? 
5,8,Towelie,30083,Kyle,What? [Stan turns around] 
5,8,Towelie,30086,Kyle,"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!! "
5,8,Towelie,30090,Kyle,Where the hell is he? 
5,8,Towelie,30093,Kyle,What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere. 
5,8,Towelie,30095,Kyle,That's a towel call? 
5,8,Towelie,30097,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water. "
5,8,Towelie,30100,Kyle,There he is! 
5,8,Towelie,30104,Kyle,Just come on! It's getting dark. 
5,8,Towelie,30107,Kyle,Are you sure this is where they said to be? 
5,8,Towelie,30118,Kyle,"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness! "
5,8,Towelie,30131,Kyle,"Aw, God-damnit! "
5,8,Towelie,30143,Kyle,Are we getting close? 
5,8,Towelie,30146,Kyle,How long has it been since you've been back there. 
5,8,Towelie,30160,Kyle,The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! [Towelie simply snorts] 
5,8,Towelie,30163,Kyle,That's it! [takes the joint] You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back! 
5,8,Towelie,30165,Kyle,I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is! 
5,8,Towelie,30190,Kyle,We're missing out on some quality video game time right now. 
5,8,Towelie,30197,Kyle,"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere? "
5,8,Towelie,30199,Kyle,Who's they? 
5,8,Towelie,30219,Kyle,Okay. 
5,8,Towelie,30227,Kyle,"Dude, I figured it out. "
5,8,Towelie,30229,Kyle,"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight! "
5,8,Towelie,30231,Kyle,Seven and a half. 
5,8,Towelie,30246,Kyle,That's it? 
5,8,Towelie,30252,Kyle,"Well let's look in here. [opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp] "
5,8,Towelie,30264,Kyle,What terrifying secret? 
5,8,Towelie,30268,Kyle,And we don't care. 
5,8,Towelie,30273,Kyle,Go ahead. [the boys move away quickly] 
5,8,Towelie,30286,Kyle,"Photon rifle, whatever. [the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.] "
5,8,Towelie,30298,Kyle,"Our GameSphere! [the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: ""Okama GameSphere""] "
5,8,Towelie,30303,Kyle,Sweet! 
5,8,Towelie,30319,Kyle,"[sees it] Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! [above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground] "
5,8,Towelie,30326,Kyle,[swings closer] I've almost got it! 
5,8,Towelie,30334,Kyle,I got it! [grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air] 
5,8,Towelie,30341,Kyle,Awesome! 
5,8,Towelie,30343,Kyle,Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30349,Kyle,...Remember when life used to be simple and cool? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30354,Kyle,"These are gas masks, Butters! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30359,Kyle,"Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30407,Kyle,"[approaching] Dude, what's going on? "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30428,Kyle,Well what are we supposed to do with it? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30431,Kyle,"Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30439,Kyle,"Uh oh, they're closing! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30443,Kyle,Yeah. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30449,Kyle,"[calls out] Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30501,Kyle,"[gets up, turns, and pounds at the door] Hey, wait! There are children in here! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30505,Kyle,[steps toward Stan] Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? [poot. Cartman blinks tightly and smiles] 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30512,Kyle,"Oh God, it was horrible! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30517,Kyle,Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30521,Kyle,"You sonofabitch, Cartman! [begins to walk away, passing Cartman] You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! [Stan passes by] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30527,Kyle,"Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30533,Kyle,Is this the right house? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30545,Kyle,Hey! What the hell are you doing?! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30550,Kyle,Then why did you send us the goat? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30555,Kyle,Jawas? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30559,Kyle,"Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30563,Kyle,"Um... [looks around, then slowly] Greetings from Canada. [now with Canadian accent] Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it? "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30567,Kyle,"Good job, fatass! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30574,Kyle,"Oh crap, it's him! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30611,Kyle,But I thought you hate us. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30613,Kyle,"Cartman, where are you going?? "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30615,Kyle,"Cartman, he's crazy! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30625,Kyle,Where do we go? [they look around] 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30644,Kyle,"All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30657,Kyle,"Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30672,Kyle,Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30678,Kyle,Yeah. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30682,Kyle,I'm confused. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30696,Kyle,[approaching with Cartman] Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30698,Kyle,Yeah. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30700,Kyle,[salutes] Go America. [lowers his right arm] Go Broncos. [moves off] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30706,Kyle,I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England! 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30710,Kyle,No. This is taking forever. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30712,Kyle,"What, Cartman? "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30714,Kyle,"It isn't that funny, Cartman. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30719,Kyle,But I never take off my hat. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30721,Kyle,This is how I look natural. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30723,Kyle,[angrily] Crap. [takes off his hat to reveal big red bushy hair] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30725,Kyle,"Gay-ass. [Cartman hops on, takes off his hat and quickly strikes a pose] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30770,Kyle,Hello? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30772,Kyle,Hello? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30774,Kyle,[getting annoyed] Cartman? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30777,Kyle,[pissed off] I don't know. Let's go see. [they walk off] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30779,Kyle,Why'd you call us? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30782,Kyle,...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton?? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30786,Kyle,"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30814,Kyle,"...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time? "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30818,Kyle,...Nuh uh. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30822,Kyle,"[starts laughing, but stifles it with his hands over his mouth] Hohly crahap, duhude, heh! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30828,Kyle,[giggles a bit] Uh 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30830,Kyle,"Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30837,Kyle,"Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing? "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30842,Kyle,[quizzically] Blew a funny fuse? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30849,Kyle,Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out! 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30851,Kyle,You gotta come to Kenny's house with us. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30863,Kyle,Alright. [the kids turn left and walk away] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30982,Kyle,Butters! Hey Butters! 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30984,Kyle,"They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30998,Kyle,"Dude, that poor kid. [walks off] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31021,Kyle,"Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31025,Kyle,Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31027,Kyle,Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31029,Kyle,"When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31032,Kyle,"There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31037,Kyle,"Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up. "
5,11,The Entity,31048,Kyle,What's he look like? 
5,11,The Entity,31050,Kyle,I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. [Ike flashes an angry look] 
5,11,The Entity,31059,Kyle,Hey dude. 
5,11,The Entity,31089,Kyle,"[sniffs] Oh, uh, wawawhat is this? "
5,11,The Entity,31091,Kyle,"Oh is, is this beef? "
5,11,The Entity,31093,Kyle,"Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass. "
5,11,The Entity,31095,Kyle,"Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh- "
5,11,The Entity,31097,Kyle,"We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble. "
5,11,The Entity,31116,Kyle,"What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it? "
5,11,The Entity,31118,Kyle,"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier? "
5,11,The Entity,31120,Kyle,"Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on. "
5,11,The Entity,31136,Kyle,"[to Stan] Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle. "
5,11,The Entity,31146,Kyle,I can't believe how cold it is out here. 
5,11,The Entity,31149,Kyle,"[""It's a really dry cold that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze. ""]"
5,11,The Entity,31151,Kyle,"[goes over to greet Cartman] Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff? "
5,11,The Entity,31153,Kyle,[observes this and gets angry] Cartman?! 
5,11,The Entity,31166,Kyle,"Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family. [Kyle Two buries his face in his hands] I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are. "
5,11,The Entity,31168,Kyle,"...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker. "
5,11,The Entity,31171,Kyle,Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here. 
5,11,The Entity,31174,Kyle,"Eh, oh, alright. [moves to Kyle Two's desk and squeezes in, and that breathing is heard again] "
5,11,The Entity,31176,Kyle,Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters. 
5,11,The Entity,31179,Kyle,"Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death? "
5,11,The Entity,31190,Kyle,"Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands. "
5,11,The Entity,31192,Kyle,"Alright then, hu-how do I catch it? "
5,11,The Entity,31194,Kyle,Now what? 
5,11,The Entity,31196,Kyle,But it's down in the snow. 
5,11,The Entity,31198,Kyle,But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands. 
5,11,The Entity,31200,Kyle,"Alright, then. [walks to the ball and digs it out] "
5,11,The Entity,31210,Kyle,Uh you did what? [Kyle Two blanches] 
5,11,The Entity,31213,Kyle,"You, you paid your friends tuh... [hangs his head] not make fun of me? "
5,11,The Entity,31215,Kyle,"Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me. "
5,11,The Entity,31217,Kyle,Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50. 
5,11,The Entity,31219,Kyle,"Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go. "
5,11,The Entity,31221,Kyle,Boy it sure is dry out here. 
5,11,The Entity,31251,Kyle,[opens the door] I'm ba-ack! 
5,11,The Entity,31267,Kyle,"I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous. "
5,11,The Entity,31269,Kyle,"It seems like I might get splinters, though. "
5,11,The Entity,31271,Kyle,"Hold on. I see. [...a bus. It revs up and leaves, headed for Connecticut. The rope between the bus and sled tightens, and the sled takes off] Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast. "
5,11,The Entity,31273,Kyle,"I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! [the bus goes around a corner and is gone] "
5,11,The Entity,31275,Kyle,It's a least a couple of hours. 
5,11,The Entity,31293,Kyle,[at the door] I'm ba-ack. 
5,11,The Entity,31295,Kyle,[enters] I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. [looks at Kyle Two] 
5,11,The Entity,31298,Kyle,"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas. [gives Kyle Two the remains of the sled] I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle. "
5,11,The Entity,31301,Kyle,"Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long. "
5,11,The Entity,31321,Kyle,I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous. 
5,11,The Entity,31328,Kyle,Can't we just play hide and seek at home? 
5,11,The Entity,31331,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus!! [the corpse starts to bleed] "
5,11,The Entity,31338,Kyle,In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs. 
5,11,The Entity,31340,Kyle,"Uh, alright then. [goes in. Stan and Kyle Two quickly seal the box with wrapping tape and carry it off] Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle. [the two boys toss the box into a luggage cart, an employee tosses the box onto the conveyor, and it falls into the cargo bay with the other luggage] Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- [the plane taxis to the runway and is ready to take off] "
5,11,The Entity,31344,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast! [as the plane climbs, the side of it is shown: Air Antarctica] Oh, I did it again!! "
5,11,The Entity,31363,Kyle,I'm back. 
5,11,The Entity,31366,Kyle,"Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there. "
5,11,The Entity,31372,Kyle,"[approaching with Sheila, carrying suitcases, ready to go home] Well, Kyle, I I gotta go. "
5,11,The Entity,31374,Kyle,"Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut. "
5,11,The Entity,31377,Kyle,"Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. [heads for the door with Sheila] "
5,11,The Entity,31383,Kyle,"Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya. "
5,11,The Entity,31386,Kyle,Re- really? 
5,11,The Entity,31390,Kyle,"Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags. "
5,11,The Entity,31392,Kyle,"I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog. [picks up his suitcases and goes towards the door] Ah I can't take it. See ya. [walks out and joins his aunt to the car. The boys are left stunned, having been judged and found wanting once again] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31403,Kyle,Haha! 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31425,Kyle,Aharmani Exchange? 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31474,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. [rises and joins Stan and Tolkien] Nobody does. They're too expensive. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31482,Kyle,"[jokingly] What's a VHS? [laughs and the others laugh as they head for the door. Cartman tosses the DVD to Tolkien, but it just falls to the floor.] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31613,Kyle,Is that fun? 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31616,Kyle,Alright. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31619,Kyle,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! [goes and does so. Kenny kicks Cartman in the nuts. Cartman returns the favor] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31736,Kyle,"Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31739,Kyle,Right. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31741,Kyle,And Stan for being in love with Wendy. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31743,Kyle,And Cartman for being fat. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31745,Kyle,And Cartman for being stupid. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31747,Kyle,And Cartman for having a whore for a mom. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31749,Kyle,And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31754,Kyle,"No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31756,Kyle,"[walks past Tolkien, behind Stan] Come on, Nurse Tolkien. We're gonna play football, you puss. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31795,Kyle,"Yeah, that was pretty good. [a cow near them drops five pellets and walks off] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31797,Kyle,"[to Kenny] 'K go! [Kenny strikes a match and lights the dung, which yields a nice fire] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31800,Kyle,"You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31807,Kyle,"What, did he lose a hundred pounds? [the boys laugh] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31812,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31816,Kyle,A trampoline? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31824,Kyle,...What? [closes his eyes in disbelief] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31827,Kyle,I'm leaving right now! [turns and heads for the door] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31829,Kyle,"[turns around] You've never watched the news, fatass! [rejoins Stan and Kenny] And what the hell does that have to do with anything?! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31832,Kyle,"Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31834,Kyle,"They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31836,Kyle,...I hate you so much. [turns around and heads back for the door again. The others turn and follow. Kenny coughs again.] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31856,Kyle,"[he and Stan take their seats] Yeah, they're gonna get busted again. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31859,Kyle,"We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31861,Kyle,"Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31865,Kyle,"Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31867,Kyle,Kenny's sick? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31875,Kyle,Wait. Kenny's going to die? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31895,Kyle,Cartman. [pause] Kenny's in the hospital. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31897,Kyle,"They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. [Stan raises his head and looks at Kyle] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31909,Kyle,"[volunteers] Hey dude, how's it going? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31912,Kyle,"Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31914,Kyle,"Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31917,Kyle,"[looks around] Stan? [sees him and follows] Stan, where are you going? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31919,Kyle,"Dude, he needs us right now. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31921,Kyle,"I, I know it's tough but- [Stan turns away] Look at me! [turns him back around] I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31923,Kyle,"Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31925,Kyle,"Stan, you can't leave! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31933,Kyle,[returning to Kenny's room] Cartman? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31935,Kyle,"Cartman, were you... crying? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31937,Kyle,"Hey Cartman. [Cartman looks up and turns around] I care a lot about him, too. [Cartman wells up again, and Kyle reaches out to hug him] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31939,Kyle,"[comforting him] Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31962,Kyle,"...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! [shows him the picture: Butters and Kenny are in a little yellow biplane] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31965,Kyle,"Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31974,Kyle,"Neat, huh Kenny? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31980,Kyle,He said his wish is not to die. [a long stretch of silence in which the cameraman looks from person to person.] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31985,Kyle,"He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. [the Foundation reps are stunned. Madonna appears in the doorway] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32025,Kyle,He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,32027,Kyle,"He just said... ""Where's Stan?"" "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32032,Kyle,"What, Cartman? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32039,Kyle,"I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32041,Kyle,AAARGH! [jumps up on Cartman and starts pummeling him. Cartman tosses him off] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32374,Kyle,"Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32383,Kyle,"Okay, Not-Kenny. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32387,Kyle,Dude! That's today! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32394,Kyle,Excuse me? Could we get through here? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32405,Kyle,Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32413,Kyle,[steps backwards] Them? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32416,Kyle,"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32418,Kyle,"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32420,Kyle,"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32422,Kyle,"It matters, dude. [Jared begins to think...] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32425,Kyle,That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32428,Kyle,Tha- that's diarrhea. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32432,Kyle,That's a great idea! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32438,Kyle,But Butters isn't fat. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32444,Kyle,Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32448,Kyle,City Wok brought him down to a size 4. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32470,Kyle,"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32477,Kyle,"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32482,Kyle,"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. [scoops out a tablespoon and hands it to Butters, but Butters doesn't take it. Chef enters and Butters begins to throw up] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32488,Kyle,Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32513,Kyle,Wow! He looks great! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32522,Kyle,Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32527,Kyle,Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32558,Kyle,"Yeah, we're all set. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32560,Kyle,"Well, what do you mean? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32564,Kyle,Wow! [he and Stan are awed] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32568,Kyle,"Yeah, you're still fat! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32575,Kyle,Why are you doing this to us?! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32581,Kyle,"[faces Stan] Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32585,Kyle,"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. [Cartman picks up one end of the tube and inserts it into the incision] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32589,Kyle,"The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. [Cartman stalls, then picks up the other end and starts sucking the fat out] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32593,Kyle,"Alright, it's working! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32602,Kyle,"It's out of control! [Stan has stopped pounding, but the fat is pulsing out and Cartman can't control it.. Butters gets thinner by the second and headed for shock] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32630,Kyle,To City Wok so we can make our money. God! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32637,Kyle,Yep. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32643,Kyle,"Wow, that was pretty good. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32664,Kyle,We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32668,Kyle,"Uh, why not? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32690,Kyle,[offscreen] Wait! [the boys run up to the gallows platform] You're all making a mistake! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32724,Kyle,"Aw, just forget the whole thing then! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32729,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams. "
6,2,Asspen,32767,Kyle,"No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee. "
6,2,Asspen,32795,Kyle,What? 
6,2,Asspen,32829,Kyle,"Go on, Ike. "
6,2,Asspen,32852,Kyle,"[practicing his moves] ...French fries... pizza... french fries... [does the pizza moves and sees Cartman fallen on his back] come on, Cartman. "
6,2,Asspen,32895,Kyle,"...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries...[loses control and jerks forward, then flips over and lands next to Ike, who's half-buried in the snow. Kyle looks over and gets up quickly. He dusts himself off as Stan catches up] I wonder where our parents are. "
6,2,Asspen,32943,Kyle,"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?! "
6,2,Asspen,32950,Kyle,What do you wanna do now? 
6,2,Asspen,32979,Kyle,"[shoves Stan a bit and faces him] Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude. "
6,2,Asspen,32981,Kyle,You don't even know Heather! 
6,2,Asspen,32986,Kyle,"Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend. "
6,2,Asspen,33034,Kyle,I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. [Cartman gives him an angry look] 
6,2,Asspen,33042,Kyle,"Awgh, dude, I can't look. [closes his eyes and covers them with his hands Tad is shown zipping further down the hill, Stan has left the summit] "
6,2,Asspen,33049,Kyle,"Good job, dude! "
6,2,Asspen,33057,Kyle,"Mom, Dad! "
6,2,Asspen,33064,Kyle,"Yeah, what a stupid sport! [the parents turn left and follow the boys away] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33078,Kyle,"Okay, Not-Kenny. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33102,Kyle,"This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33107,Kyle,Cool! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33110,Kyle,[he and the other two follow Cartman] Do you think they'll believe it? 
6,3,Freak Strike,33115,Kyle,Awesome! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33120,Kyle,But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin? 
6,3,Freak Strike,33122,Kyle,Yeah. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33128,Kyle,"Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33133,Kyle,We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33137,Kyle,"We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33150,Kyle,That looks awesome! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33158,Kyle,[softly] Why the hell would they want that anyway? [drops to a whisper] Episode I sucked balls. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33170,Kyle,"Yeah, he sure is. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33214,Kyle,This is gonna be awesome! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33243,Kyle,Wow! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33247,Kyle,Yeah! We thought of the whole thing! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33439,Kyle,[to Stan] City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33444,Kyle,"Aw, dude. [Two workers come and carry the cow's body away, leaving the head behind. Rancher Bob reaches down for a skinned leg and holds it up] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33450,Kyle,"Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""?? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33455,Kyle,What?? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33460,Kyle,Yeah. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33466,Kyle,"[opening the window] Come on, we've gotta go! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33470,Kyle,"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33480,Kyle,What?! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33482,Kyle,"Screw you, Cartman! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33485,Kyle,No! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33488,Kyle,Have Butters kiss it. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33490,Kyle,Awww! [wipes off his face and then waves away the smell] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33492,Kyle,Sick! I felt it on my face! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33495,Kyle,[taken aback] HYAAAAA! [loses his temper via short temper lunges at Cartman and starts hitting him angrily] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33506,Kyle,You need to freeze some of your ass off. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33508,Kyle,"What? [below, Stan removes the chains from the remaining calves] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33513,Kyle,Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33517,Kyle,Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33520,Kyle,"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33529,Kyle,Butters had that at his house? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33533,Kyle,All right! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33537,Kyle,"Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33560,Kyle,"You're getting in pretty deep, dude. [Stan glares back with a look of determination] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33568,Kyle,So what happens now? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33570,Kyle,"We're with you, dude. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33575,Kyle,"We're with you, Stan. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33585,Kyle,[pause] ...No I won't. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33588,Kyle,"Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33596,Kyle,Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say. [begins to whisper in Butters' ear] You can tell them... 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33606,Kyle,"Cartman, stay away from that door! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33612,Kyle,"But we will have to sleep, dude. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33625,Kyle,Good night. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33630,Kyle,We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33634,Kyle,"[looks back at Stan] He might be right, dude. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33643,Kyle,All right! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33646,Kyle,Yeah! And fried chicken! [Stan sits at a corner with his apples.] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33650,Kyle,"We're eating, dude. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33652,Kyle,Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33657,Kyle,"[looks over] Dude, that's messed up. [Stan looks as well, but goes back to his apples] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33659,Kyle,"You guys, check this out! [a TV now sits where the football normally is, and the picture shown is that of Stan's house. The other boys join Kyle in looking at the news report from News 4] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33668,Kyle,It is? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33678,Kyle,"Huh, what the hell is that? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33684,Kyle,Dude! Those gaywads are on our side? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33696,Kyle,"Dude, are you okay? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33699,Kyle,"Dude, maybe we should end this. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33709,Kyle,Don't give him anything! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33721,Kyle,Dude! [Cartman holds out his palm to silence them] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33750,Kyle,"[dabbing Stan's sores with a moist towel] Stan's getting worse, you guys. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33781,Kyle,[rushes to Stan] Stan! It worked! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33783,Kyle,"They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33808,Kyle,Mexico here we come! [Dorn honks to clear everyone out of the way.] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33816,Kyle,"Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33822,Kyle,Oh no! No!! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33837,Kyle,"Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry! [Stan doesn't respond. He's passed out] Stan? Stan?? [Butters appears next to them] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33842,Kyle,"Whoa, dude. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33850,Kyle,"But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33856,Kyle,Do we have everything? 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33859,Kyle,"Look, it's almost time. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33877,Kyle,It's the biggest night of the year. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33894,Kyle,"[gathers around Stan with the other boys] Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33897,Kyle,You'd miss the new trailer? 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33902,Kyle,Kyle. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33906,Kyle,"Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33909,Kyle,"Dude, thank God for stupid people [""...We'll have to go somewhere else...""] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33921,Kyle,"Just don't mess with it, Cartman. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33923,Kyle,Just just leave it alone. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33928,Kyle,God-dammit Cartman! You broke it! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33932,Kyle,"God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33946,Kyle,We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. [the boys sit on the sofa. Ike looks at each of them angrily] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33951,Kyle,"No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! [Ike drops down and walks away, Cartman sits next to Butters] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33955,Kyle,They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33958,Kyle,"But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33960,Kyle,"God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33971,Kyle,"God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33988,Kyle,"Heuh, the commercials! [some commercials air, but they're not important, as little sound is heard] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33993,Kyle,"Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34006,Kyle,"Get it back to normal, Chef! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34010,Kyle,The TV left. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34035,Kyle,We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34051,Kyle,We're not too late! [the boys grin] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34081,Kyle,They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34083,Kyle,Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retarded Russell Crowe show! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34111,Kyle,"That's disgusting, dude! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34124,Kyle,"It's okay, it's still the show. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34128,Kyle,"Oh, dude, I don't know how long I can take it. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34130,Kyle,Will your sister let us watch it? 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34142,Kyle,Look! Crack addicts with a television! [two men and a woman are shown watching a small TV on a box near some buildings. The boys walk up to them and watch the TV as well] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34151,Kyle,Oh Jesus! Now where do we go?? 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34154,Kyle,Well why not?! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34158,Kyle,This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34166,Kyle,The last commercial break is starting! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34170,Kyle,What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing? 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34173,Kyle,That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34181,Kyle,They were wearing cowboy hats! [to Stan] Did you see?? [to Butters] Did you see?? [Butters stops dancing] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34187,Kyle,"It looks even better than their first movie, huh? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34202,Kyle,Who wants to tell him? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34214,Kyle,Lame. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34218,Kyle,"But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34222,Kyle,"We're sorry, Butters. [Cartman leaves his chair and approaches Butters] Our mind is made up. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34224,Kyle,Phew. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34226,Kyle,"Hm, he took that pretty well, I think. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34249,Kyle,[seated on a cyan sofa] Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34253,Kyle,"[a shot of Kyle, Cartman, Tweek, and Towelie in a spinning teacup] Towelie is a tough choice because, [cut to Kyle talking] even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34259,Kyle,"[on the sofa] But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell lame jokes. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34268,Kyle,"[holds up a rose for every kid he calls] Tolkien. [Tolkien approaches, gets his rose and goes back to his seat] Clyde. [Clyde goes for his rose] Craig. [Craig goes for his rose] Timmy. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34271,Kyle,"Pip. [Pip smiles and goes for his rose] Jimmy. [Jimmy goes for his rose] Jason. [a new boy with high forehead, goes for his rose] Towelie. [Towelie goes for his rose] Luigi. [Luigi goes for his rose]. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34273,Kyle,Tweek. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34290,Kyle,This looks pretty good. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34323,Kyle,"You're such a fatass, Cartman! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34338,Kyle,"[as before, holds up a rose for every name] Tolkien. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34340,Kyle,Timmy. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34342,Kyle,Tweek. [Tweek goes for his rose] Pip. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34344,Kyle,Towelie. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34347,Kyle,Jimmy. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34373,Kyle,"Anything that'll impress us, Tolkien. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34378,Kyle,"[back to recap] Well Tolkien was a definite winner of the talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34383,Kyle,Yeah! Isn't this great?! 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34406,Kyle,"Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34408,Kyle,"Eh now, [pounds the table with his fist] come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34413,Kyle,So? You're a smartass! 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34415,Kyle,Good point. [Stan sets the picture down. A door opens] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34420,Kyle,Cool. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34445,Kyle,Just stick it on. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34450,Kyle,Yeah. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34454,Kyle,"[walks up to Tweek] Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! [takes the carrot from Tweek's hand] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34457,Kyle,Yeah. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34465,Kyle,No way. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34467,Kyle,Nuh uh. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34469,Kyle,No way. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34471,Kyle,Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. [Cartman's smile vanishes and he shuts his eyes.] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34475,Kyle,"[resigned] Ah, alright. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34509,Kyle,"I told you, Cartman. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34514,Kyle,[approaches the tank] Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34545,Kyle,"See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34554,Kyle,Oh God! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34561,Kyle,"Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34567,Kyle,We don't know who else to talk to. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34574,Kyle,"Wow, I guess this really is a big deal. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34591,Kyle,[takes a wide covered beaker and look in it] There's nothing here! [puts it back and Stan approaches] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34594,Kyle,"Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34601,Kyle,Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. [covers his nose] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34605,Kyle,"Quick. Hide. [the boys disperse. Stan runs to the closet he looked in earlier, Kyle to one on the opposite side, Tweek behind the door] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34610,Kyle,Got it! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34630,Kyle,It is? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34634,Kyle,"Oh, really?? [all four boys let out a sigh of relief] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34639,Kyle,"I'm so glad we're not murderers. [Cartman closes the door behind them, moves to his bed and talkes off his hat and shoes. He places his hat on a corner of the footboard and hops into bed] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34646,Kyle,Whoa. [the close-up reveals a budding civilization with sea people building multi-story apartments and reads. The brine shrimp have begun to morph into sea people. Some of them wear clothes] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34649,Kyle,Whoa. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34655,Kyle,Well what are you gonna do? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34703,Kyle,"Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34712,Kyle,Huh. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34725,Kyle,Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? [Butters looks on with some trepidation] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34733,Kyle,...Yeah. So? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34743,Kyle,Hey! It's Tweek. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34747,Kyle,The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34754,Kyle,Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34811,Kyle,[stopping by] Hey dudes. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34814,Kyle,What are you guys doin'? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34816,Kyle,In your butts? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34818,Kyle,Why would he put anything in your butts? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34821,Kyle,[joins them on the curb] Hm. [long pause] 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34826,Kyle,"Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34830,Kyle,Yeah. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34832,Kyle,"Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34834,Kyle,It wouldn't work! 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34836,Kyle,I don't need to. It wouldn't work. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34838,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34872,Kyle,"Well, Cartman? "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34877,Kyle,"Well, go on, smartass, and do it! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34881,Kyle,No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth! 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34883,Kyle,Get the fuck out of here! 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34905,Kyle,What? [appears genuinely concerned] 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34943,Kyle,"[simmers quietly, then] Go fuck yourself, Cartman! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34945,Kyle,"[feeling angered, gets off the couch and confronts Cartman] Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34947,Kyle,So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! [a news bulletin's music is heard] 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34953,Kyle,"[moves closer to Cartman] It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a freakin' medal?! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34955,Kyle,[kyle's short temper is set off] HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35001,Kyle,[irritated] So? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35003,Kyle,"[approaches Cartman and tries a different tack] Cartman, there's something I need to tell you. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35005,Kyle,"You were totally, one hundred percent right. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35007,Kyle,"You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend. "
6,9,Free Hat,35030,Kyle,"No, dude. Spielberg changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C. "
6,9,Free Hat,35043,Kyle,Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were! 
6,9,Free Hat,35046,Kyle,"Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now. "
6,9,Free Hat,35050,Kyle,"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club. "
6,9,Free Hat,35061,Kyle,"""Free hat?"" "
6,9,Free Hat,35086,Kyle,"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough. "
6,9,Free Hat,35091,Kyle,"[steps forward] Tweek! It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats. "
6,9,Free Hat,35115,Kyle,We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers... 
6,9,Free Hat,35126,Kyle,What? 
6,9,Free Hat,35129,Kyle,Yah. 
6,9,Free Hat,35133,Kyle,You?? Why? 
6,9,Free Hat,35137,Kyle,Me. 
6,9,Free Hat,35139,Kyle,"Alright, fine! [points to Cartman] You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up! "
6,9,Free Hat,35150,Kyle,We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane. 
6,9,Free Hat,35161,Kyle,"Ah, we thought we were speaking for the children. "
6,9,Free Hat,35169,Kyle,"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark! "
6,9,Free Hat,35173,Kyle,[regretting the comparison] No. NOO!! 
6,9,Free Hat,35183,Kyle,[rushes to the mic] Nonono! We need to do this first. 
6,9,Free Hat,35197,Kyle,We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that? 
6,9,Free Hat,35206,Kyle,[eyeing a prop] This looks like the right room. 
6,9,Free Hat,35209,Kyle,That's it! 
6,9,Free Hat,35218,Kyle,"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas! [goes down on his right knee] But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark. "
6,9,Free Hat,35228,Kyle,"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, r-tard. "
6,9,Free Hat,35231,Kyle,Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song. 
6,9,Free Hat,35238,Kyle,"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. [Lucas hangs his head in shame and turns away] "
6,9,Free Hat,35240,Kyle,You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed. 
6,9,Free Hat,35243,Kyle,"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society. "
6,9,Free Hat,35252,Kyle,"Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! [Lucas, stuck between the two arguments, stops and thinks...] "
6,9,Free Hat,35255,Kyle,What?? 
6,9,Free Hat,35302,Kyle,Yup. 
6,9,Free Hat,35304,Kyle,"Come on, Tweek! Blow it up! "
6,9,Free Hat,35326,Kyle,Yeah. I I think so. 
6,9,Free Hat,35333,Kyle,...What? [a thin balding man with creepy appearance walks onstage and waves to everyone] 
6,9,Free Hat,35341,Kyle,"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan? [the boys stop] I mean, no one even seemed to notice. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35351,Kyle,"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35382,Kyle,"Dude, look at Bebe. [""We'll move into the five times thing."" Bebe is busy taking notes. ""We'll try five times three...""] Something seems different about her. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35384,Kyle,I don't know. [Bebe continues writing] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35397,Kyle,Dude! Bebe is really smart! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35407,Kyle,"Yeah, it's cool. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35410,Kyle,Yeah. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35418,Kyle,[looks over his shoulder] Yeah. She's really cool. [Wendy gets upset] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35430,Kyle,"That was sweet, Bebe. [shows her another rock and another grip] Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you- "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35432,Kyle,[pulls back] I'm showing her. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35434,Kyle,"[gives an ape look and smacks Clyde, who lets go of the rock] Hoh! "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35436,Kyle,"Hoh! [watches, then reverts to normal and talks to Bebe. Stan moves in] Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and- "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35438,Kyle,"[peeved] Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe backs up, scared] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35440,Kyle,Hah hah hah! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35444,Kyle,We were throwing rocks at cars. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35482,Kyle,Maybe she's in the lunch line. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35518,Kyle,Yep. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35520,Kyle,Right. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35523,Kyle,Yeah. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35526,Kyle,Huh?? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35529,Kyle,"Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning! "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35535,Kyle,No way! Tweek's cool! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35561,Kyle,I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35568,Kyle,[steps forward and grunts] Hoh hoh hoh! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35574,Kyle,Is Bebe home? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35599,Kyle,What the hell are you doing? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35601,Kyle,"[moves over to Bebe] Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35725,Kyle,Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35729,Kyle,But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35736,Kyle,Boobs are stupid! 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35775,Kyle,It will. 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35778,Kyle,So? 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35871,Kyle,"Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out! "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35877,Kyle,"But, wait. Where's the other team? [the field is shown. The opposing bullpen is empty and there are no opposing players on the field. There's no visiting team out there.] "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35889,Kyle,"Dude, we weren't playing anybody. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35911,Kyle,"[volunteers] You're such a fatass, Cartman. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35991,Kyle,"Yeah, it was like four days ago! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36024,Kyle,It was such a long time ago! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36031,Kyle,"Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36037,Kyle,"Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [hands the stub to Kenny] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36046,Kyle,"We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body?? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36050,Kyle,Yeah. Closure. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36064,Kyle,"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! [Cartman looks back at the boys angrily, gets Kenny's urn, and climbs back out the window. Seconds later, a robot guard does indeed move through the living room...] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36067,Kyle,"Alright, we made it! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36069,Kyle,"Let him out, Cartman! [Cartman opens the urn and the boys duck] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36071,Kyle,Is he in there? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36074,Kyle,I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! [Cartman samples the ashes] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36078,Kyle,Why would they play such a cruel joke on us? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36081,Kyle,"Goddamnit! There has to be a way! [leaves his stool and follows Stan out. Cartman looks at the ashes, then thinks of something] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36090,Kyle,"A ladder to heaven. [unfolds some blueprints] We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36116,Kyle,Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36123,Kyle,Cartman? Cartman?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36125,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36127,Kyle,Maybe you got brain cancer. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36150,Kyle,"[with Cartman at the top of the ladder] Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36153,Kyle,Do you see anything? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36155,Kyle,Grandma?? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36159,Kyle,Huh? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36163,Kyle,[processes the comment and gets angry] What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36165,Kyle,Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36167,Kyle,[Lose his temper via short temper] HAAHH!!! [smacks Cartman on the side of the face with his left fist] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36170,Kyle,Hey Kenny. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36181,Kyle,You're too fat to be Kenny. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36210,Kyle,"What?? For God's sake, why?? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36212,Kyle,Are you gonna burn me? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36214,Kyle,Jesus Christ! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36221,Kyle,"You did, dude! You drank his whole body! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36227,Kyle,"Yeah. Good job, fatass! [leaves the table] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36243,Kyle,We're all gonna pitch in on an entry! [the last few words echo a few times. Fast forward to the day the boys are at Lolly's] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36247,Kyle,"Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [the last word echoes a few times. He hands the stub to Kenny] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36262,Kyle,"What do you mean, fatass? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36266,Kyle,Do you see anything? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36291,Kyle,"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36296,Kyle,"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36303,Kyle,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36306,Kyle,"Whoa. [shakes Cartman around] Kenny, you in there? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36309,Kyle,"Stop him, Kenny! [follows them off. The camera suddenly pans up] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36321,Kyle,"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36326,Kyle,"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it? "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36336,Kyle,[notices something and gasps] Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36340,Kyle,"I'm a Paladin, Cartman! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36384,Kyle,Quick! A monster of Rivendell! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36395,Kyle,"[turns left] Gentlemen, we are off! [the boys turn back to walk to Butters' house. Randy watches them leave] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36402,Kyle,[walks off. Butters is saddened] The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36407,Kyle,Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36409,Kyle,"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. [Little does Kyle know what Butters' idea of LotR is. The boys turn to walk away] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36411,Kyle,"[glares at Butters] Butters, what the hell are you doing?! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36413,Kyle,"[smacks Butters with the tape, causing him to fall off] Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36419,Kyle,This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite oddly. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36423,Kyle,"Oh, crap, the sixth graders! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36432,Kyle,You can't keep it. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36437,Kyle,"[aside to Stan] Dude, that video is making people act strange. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36457,Kyle,We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36461,Kyle,Hide! [they jump over the massive root and hide in the pocket underneath. The lead sixth grader comes into view and sniffs the air. He hops off and looks around over the root. The boys look up in apprehension. The sixth grader sniffs around above them] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36464,Kyle,Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36467,Kyle,"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. [the boys leave the root] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36490,Kyle,We have in our possession something of great power. [pulls out the videotape] It is... The Lord of the Rings. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36526,Kyle,This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36530,Kyle,[picks up the tape and looks for the store name] Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36541,Kyle,[flashes anger] Paladin! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36550,Kyle,We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36552,Kyle,[gasps a little] We were almost killed. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36579,Kyle,"Hey, what are you guys doing? [the Bailey kids turn and look] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36582,Kyle,[suddenly wary] You guys. Somebody is following us. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36584,Kyle,Butters? 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36591,Kyle,"Jimmy, are you sure? "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36595,Kyle,They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36611,Kyle,"Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36615,Kyle,Oh brother! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36619,Kyle,"No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36642,Kyle,Oh no! They're closed! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36648,Kyle,Finally. [he and Cartman move towards the box. Butters looks on] It's over. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36650,Kyle,Butters! No! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36653,Kyle,[goes after Butters and tries to wrest the tape from him] It has to go back! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36656,Kyle,"[picks Butters up and carries him off] Let go of the tape, Butters! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36658,Kyle,Fine! [tosses him into the drop box] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36664,Kyle,Middle-earth is again safe. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36710,Kyle,Funny. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36713,Kyle,Not him! 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36719,Kyle,[rolls his eyes] Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36746,Kyle,"Hey guys, can we talk to you? [with him are Stan, Cartman, Butters, and Tweek] "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36749,Kyle,"Uhh, not cool. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36754,Kyle,"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36783,Kyle,"""Fat tits."" That's a good one. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36821,Kyle,Bad. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36825,Kyle,"Gays, I guess. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36829,Kyle,"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36832,Kyle,"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36895,Kyle,"Uh, a bear? "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36897,Kyle,"[trembling in fear] Eh I, I don't know what else to paint. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36899,Kyle,Aaaa! [hurries to finish the painting] 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36901,Kyle,[trembling] People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow! 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36919,Kyle,[Suddenly falls on his face] Oh. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36921,Kyle,[limply] Can't... glue... any... more. [falls on his face again] 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37016,Kyle,"Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37019,Kyle,"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37021,Kyle,"Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care? "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37044,Kyle,We're going to New York? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37047,Kyle,[the boys begin to put on headphones] Oh cool. We get to watch a movie? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37067,Kyle,We have a dead friend. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37075,Kyle,Yee-yeah. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37081,Kyle,I'm Kyle. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37083,Kyle,[responding] Yeah. My Grandma. [looks around] She's here? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37085,Kyle,Oh my God! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37098,Kyle,[exits the studio a bit panicked.] Grandma's watching me. Always watching me. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37111,Kyle,Four white birds! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37113,Kyle,"There's four white birds! [Sees a sign for Jewleeard, a private school for young Jews. The sign has four birds in flight above a small school, two stars of David flanking the building, and two traditional Jewish men in overcoats, one at each end of the sign. A phone number is shown underneath. Kyle and Stan walk closer to the sign] This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37115,Kyle,So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37117,Kyle,I'm not going back. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37119,Kyle,I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud! [drops his ticket on the ground] Tell my parents I'll call them. [hurries away] 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37164,Kyle,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants! "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37166,Kyle,He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37267,Kyle,You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37305,Kyle,"[now next to Stan with fake beard in hand] You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37351,Kyle,"[thrusts the bag at Clyde] Throw it away, Clyde! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37354,Kyle,[points at the joint] Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37357,Kyle,What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37363,Kyle,...Where did you have sex with her? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37418,Kyle,Wow. That's pretty cool. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37420,Kyle,"'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37425,Kyle,"Hey, what happens to me in the future? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37712,Kyle,"[naturally weary of Cartman's cheer] What are you doing, Cartman? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37718,Kyle,What's it? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37731,Kyle,That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37733,Kyle,Mr. Hankey! [an instrumental of Mr. Hankey's theme song plays] 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37736,Kyle,Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37742,Kyle,But how are we gonna get to the North Pole? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37746,Kyle,Yeah. [does the same] 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37750,Kyle,Me neither. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37758,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman?? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37766,Kyle,Finally! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37774,Kyle,Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37797,Kyle,"Wow, cool! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37824,Kyle,Is that what this is all about?! [Stan shoots a quizzical stare] You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! [Stan is angry now] 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37839,Kyle,"Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37847,Kyle,What are you doing? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37849,Kyle,"Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37851,Kyle,All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37880,Kyle,We don't know. They lost all contact with him. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37920,Kyle,"Jesus, behind you! [Jesus looks at the boys. The soldier shoots Jesus in the back] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37930,Kyle,"You bastards. [behind them, soldiers mass at the other end of the hall] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37936,Kyle,"On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. [the sleigh begins to move forward and Santa runs out of ammo. He drops the guns and heads for the moving sleigh. He hops in and the remaining soldiers fire at the departing sleigh. The sleigh goes up and away] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37938,Kyle,"Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37964,Kyle,[runs up to his parents] Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37973,Kyle,"Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37978,Kyle,"Dude, where have you been? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37980,Kyle,"Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. [walks away with his Haibo doll. Stan follows with his Haibo doll, and Cartman follows with an angry look] "
7,1,Cancelled,37985,Kyle,"Ah, dammit! "
7,1,Cancelled,37987,Kyle,"My Goddamn little brother's trying to follow me to school, again! "
7,1,Cancelled,37989,Kyle,"No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. "
7,1,Cancelled,37991,Kyle,"Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo! "
7,1,Cancelled,37994,Kyle,Yeah. Check it out. [sets up Ike and prepares for a kick] Ready Ike? Kick the baby! 
7,1,Cancelled,37996,Kyle,Kick the baby! 
7,1,Cancelled,37999,Kyle,Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. 
7,1,Cancelled,38001,Kyle,Really? What about? 
7,1,Cancelled,38004,Kyle,Totally! 
7,1,Cancelled,38009,Kyle,Yeah. This does seem really familiar. 
7,1,Cancelled,38011,Kyle,"Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream? "
7,1,Cancelled,38015,Kyle,You don't? 
7,1,Cancelled,38018,Kyle,"Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. [the sound of wheels approaching] "
7,1,Cancelled,38020,Kyle,[to Stan] And then you said... 
7,1,Cancelled,38024,Kyle,Weird 
7,1,Cancelled,38030,Kyle,Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day. 
7,1,Cancelled,38036,Kyle,"What is a proc-tologist, Chef? "
7,1,Cancelled,38040,Kyle,What a dick! 
7,1,Cancelled,38045,Kyle,Other than his monstrous size. 
7,1,Cancelled,38055,Kyle,"And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it. "
7,1,Cancelled,38060,Kyle,Are you okay? 
7,1,Cancelled,38076,Kyle,"What!? No way! [looks to his left and points] You do it, Kenny! "
7,1,Cancelled,38079,Kyle,I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt! 
7,1,Cancelled,38082,Kyle,God-damnit Cartman! 
7,1,Cancelled,38084,Kyle,Stop it Cartman! 
7,1,Cancelled,38087,Kyle,God Dammit! 
7,1,Cancelled,38094,Kyle,That's it! [walks off] I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it! 
7,1,Cancelled,38097,Kyle,No! 
7,1,Cancelled,38099,Kyle,You're lying! 
7,1,Cancelled,38106,Kyle,That does it! CHARGE! [drives his finger into Cartman's butthole. Cartman farts and screams as the anal probe shoot out of his ass. The probe opens up into the satellite dish and the dish sends a beam into outer space. Part of the space center is destroyed in the process] 
7,1,Cancelled,38109,Kyle,It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff. 
7,1,Cancelled,38112,Kyle,We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth? 
7,1,Cancelled,38115,Kyle,Candy bars? 
7,1,Cancelled,38121,Kyle,Aaaah! Runrunruuun! [the group makes it outside] 
7,1,Cancelled,38126,Kyle,"[turns back] The aliens are chasing us! [a close-up of the four aliens in the car behind Chef. A passenger-side visitor leans out and draws a revolver, shooting at Chef. A bullet strikes the rear window and the boys jump] "
7,1,Cancelled,38132,Kyle,[looks out and back] I think we ditched them. 
7,1,Cancelled,38146,Kyle,"[stirs in his own pod] What the? Where are, where are we? "
7,1,Cancelled,38149,Kyle,It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship. 
7,1,Cancelled,38154,Kyle,Yeah. 
7,1,Cancelled,38162,Kyle,"Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay. "
7,1,Cancelled,38175,Kyle,No! [the alien turns into J.J. Walker] 
7,1,Cancelled,38202,Kyle,Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover? 
7,1,Cancelled,38206,Kyle,Earth? 
7,1,Cancelled,38210,Kyle,"You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up. "
7,1,Cancelled,38227,Kyle,What?? Who canceled us? 
7,1,Cancelled,38235,Kyle,"Dude, we have to try! "
7,1,Cancelled,38257,Kyle,"Mighty, powerful network executives, we have come in a great distance in order to have-- "
7,1,Cancelled,38266,Kyle,"[Begging, with his hands together] Please don't cancel us. Please. "
7,1,Cancelled,38272,Kyle,"Oh my God, this is great! "
7,1,Cancelled,38284,Kyle,Kenny! [Kenny stops] 
7,1,Cancelled,38314,Kyle,The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show. 
7,1,Cancelled,38317,Kyle,And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons. 
7,1,Cancelled,38324,Kyle,Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night. 
7,1,Cancelled,38327,Kyle,What the hell is that? 
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38357,Kyle,"Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38362,Kyle,"Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. [they turn right and trot off] "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38375,Kyle,What? 
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38383,Kyle,"Cartman, just stay out of it. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38478,Kyle,Yup. I'm not seeing anything. 
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38625,Kyle,Me too. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38630,Kyle,A reindeer? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38644,Kyle,How dare she talk to us like that?! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38650,Kyle,TP her house? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38652,Kyle,Oh. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38660,Kyle,Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38671,Kyle,"You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38673,Kyle,Oh. [flashes disgust] Uuugh. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38677,Kyle,"Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38679,Kyle,So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38681,Kyle,"We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38686,Kyle,What have we done? [Stan looks back and gets Kyle] 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38689,Kyle,"We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38691,Kyle,How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38693,Kyle,"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38697,Kyle,"Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38702,Kyle,"[wakes up, startled] Ah! Oh God! Oh God! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38711,Kyle,Oh God! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38713,Kyle,How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38717,Kyle,I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38720,Kyle,"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought... "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38728,Kyle,Why are they doing us one at a time? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38730,Kyle,[brightens up] I can get a better deal? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38748,Kyle,"Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38753,Kyle,"[wakes up, startled] Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth! [hops off the bed and runs to the bedroom door] Mooooomm! [opens the door and finds Cartman in the hallway] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38755,Kyle,I was... I was just going to get a drink of water. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38757,Kyle,[takes the glass] Oh. Okay. Thanks. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38759,Kyle,"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38810,Kyle,"What's this all about, Cartman? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38812,Kyle,A boat ride? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38814,Kyle,"Well, okay. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38816,Kyle,Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38818,Kyle,"I don't know what to do. [Cartman reaches for the bat while Kyle has his back to him] Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now. [Cartman takes aim] Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before. [Cartman moves the bat around, measuring Kyle] So cold. The world can feel like that. [Cartman moves forward, ready to whack him] So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens. [Cartman takes a whack at Kyle's head, but all Kyle does is blink] Ow. [rubs his head and turns around] What the hell are you doing, Cartman?! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38820,Kyle,Cartman! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38822,Kyle,"You wanna kill me?! Fine! [turns around and crosses his arms] I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! [Cartman lowers the bat and thinks a bit, then resumes whacking Kyle. Once. Then eight more times.] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38850,Kyle,They did? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38852,Kyle,Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38863,Kyle,You con-fessed? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38867,Kyle,"[turns away, and the other boys huddle around him] You guys, we can't let him do this! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38870,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38872,Kyle,Because it was- 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38878,Kyle,"I still feel bad, Cartman "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38880,Kyle,Yeah. That makes it even worse. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38882,Kyle,I know. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38889,Kyle,We feel bad for other people. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38915,Kyle,"You can't kill all three of us, Cartman! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38920,Kyle,"[rushes in] Hold it! [Stan and Kenny rush in behind him] Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streibel. We have something we need to tell you. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38926,Kyle,We have to confess that we were the ones that- 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38930,Kyle,Cartman?? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38934,Kyle,That's not fair! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38936,Kyle,"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38938,Kyle,This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38947,Kyle,"Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38949,Kyle,"Oh Jesus! [buries his face in his hands, then raises it as Cartman talks] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38951,Kyle,You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38953,Kyle,"Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38973,Kyle,What should we do? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38980,Kyle,[pause] Ih ih ih-t's g-gay? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38982,Kyle,"[looks at his sign] Uuuh, n-no blood for oil. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39002,Kyle,"[smacks Cartman] Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39006,Kyle,[annoyed] SHUT UP AND STUDY! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39008,Kyle,[noticing] What are you doing? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39014,Kyle,"That isn't gonna work, dumbass! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39032,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be studying! [the boys stop at the entrance to Cartman's room] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39036,Kyle,"Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39038,Kyle,Cartman? Cartman?? [the boys gather around Cartman. Kyle turns him over.] 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39040,Kyle,"No, turdpants, it's Kyle! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39060,Kyle,"Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! [there's debris all over the living room. The boys arrive at Cartman hanging from a candy-cane colored swing set with the swings removed. Beneath him is a tub of water. Cartman has it rigged so that he pulls a string, which releases him and at the same time triggers a sledgehammer, which hits a box, which is supposed to land in the tub with him.] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39064,Kyle,"Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39070,Kyle,Cartman? [no response] Cartman?? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39088,Kyle,"Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! [shakes him hard] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39090,Kyle,"But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39110,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus... "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39128,Kyle,[shoves his book off the table] God damnit! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39134,Kyle,Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39180,Kyle,We didn't do our homework. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39213,Kyle,He does? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39222,Kyle,Cartman? Cartman saved the day? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39239,Kyle,[covers his nose and shuts his eyes tight] I-I don't know. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39242,Kyle,I hate this town. I-I really really do. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39244,Kyle,"[wearing an argyle sweater] ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. [cheers from the school crowd before him] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39247,Kyle,Cool. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39251,Kyle,No way. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39280,Kyle,It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39282,Kyle,"No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39291,Kyle,[swats Cartman's hand away]Stop it! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39296,Kyle,"Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39298,Kyle,"She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39302,Kyle,"Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39308,Kyle,God dammit! [follows reluctantly] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39314,Kyle,"Cartman, will you stop this gayness?! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39316,Kyle,That's not what I meant! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39330,Kyle,"Can we go now, please?! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39332,Kyle,"Stop it, Cartman! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39399,Kyle,[decide to answer] ...What? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39404,Kyle,No! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39446,Kyle,"Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39448,Kyle,Good. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39450,Kyle,"Aw, God-dammit! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39453,Kyle,That does it. I'm out. [walks off] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39541,Kyle,"Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39544,Kyle,I hate you. [turns right and walks out] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39565,Kyle,Come in. [the bell rings again.] COME IN!! [Cartman enters wearing an oven mitt over his left hand.] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39569,Kyle,So stop doing it! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39571,Kyle,You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39574,Kyle,"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39576,Kyle,I can see your lips moving! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39578,Kyle,See?! I just saw your lips move! 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39581,Kyle,"Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39583,Kyle,"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!"" "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39585,Kyle,"YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room] "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39590,Kyle,Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out] 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39598,Kyle,Oh Jesus. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39616,Kyle,"[exasperated] Oh no, no, no. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39618,Kyle,Stop. It. 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39621,Kyle,"[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Conner? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39623,Kyle,"[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39638,Kyle,"Awww, shit! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39642,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a great idea. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39647,Kyle,Really? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39652,Kyle,"Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39658,Kyle,I think we can piece this case together now. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39661,Kyle,"Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39664,Kyle,"Your husband. [he looks closer at it, putting his hands on the window] He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39669,Kyle,Then saw off the arms and legs. [shown in all its graphic glory] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39673,Kyle,"But before he could go through with his entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten... [a new scenario: the man now has the hammer, but the pie is gone when he checks up on it] ...by your dog. [a shot of Duke eating the pie in his doghouse] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39681,Kyle,We're in business! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39690,Kyle,Do you know where your doll is? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39695,Kyle,"All right, let's see. [Kenny turns the paper around and shows off a crudely-drawn woman with huge, olive-shaped boobs] Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39700,Kyle,[at the window] But the window isn't locked. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39702,Kyle,Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39714,Kyle,"Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39721,Kyle,"Yeah, but how? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39742,Kyle,How... do you make semen come out? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39746,Kyle,"Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39773,Kyle,What? [Cartman repeats the gestures again] What?? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39775,Kyle,"[gasps, then with determination, in hushed tones] They've got the doll! [he, Stan, and Kenny move in and the four boys take positions around the door. Kyle stands at the door, Cartman and Kenny on either side, Stan at Kyle's back] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39782,Kyle,What do we do now? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39787,Kyle,"Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39794,Kyle,We've got to do something. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39806,Kyle,...Grrrr!!! [the boys turn and walk away] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39809,Kyle,But they said we can't charge the front door. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39817,Kyle,"We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, ass-face! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39833,Kyle,[Kyle opens his] Wow! [the others have similar reactions] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39839,Kyle,Ah... a a a meth lab? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39842,Kyle,"What is a meth lab, anyway? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39846,Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. [windows begin breaking as shots are fired at the boys] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39855,Kyle,We're sorry. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39875,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39878,Kyle,"Better how, dude? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39880,Kyle,We were happy playing Laundromat Owners. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39901,Kyle,"Uh we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39911,Kyle,"Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was- "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39916,Kyle,No. [the boys walk away] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39920,Kyle,"Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39928,Kyle,"Uh, it's okay. We know the owner. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39972,Kyle,"Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39974,Kyle,Certainly. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39979,Kyle,"That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40002,Kyle,"What is Native American comedy, anyway? "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40029,Kyle,"Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40031,Kyle,I said I wanna leave. 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40033,Kyle,"What?? No, no, I mean, I- "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40066,Kyle,[correcting] Native Americans. [Stan rises and walks away from the building] 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40081,Kyle,Dog parade? 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40083,Kyle,How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that? 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40102,Kyle,"[opens a book he's carrying and reads] The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one. [looks up and closes the book] That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40129,Kyle,What the hell are they doing?? 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40168,Kyle,You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40250,Kyle,"Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40265,Kyle,What?! Get the hell out of here! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40275,Kyle,"[joins them, but dressed as usual] Hey dudes. [the others glance at him] "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40277,Kyle,What? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40279,Kyle,"Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40294,Kyle,"[waves] Hi Mom, Hi Dad! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40296,Kyle,"I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! [leads the others boys out of the living room] "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40332,Kyle,[happily] Thanks. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40345,Kyle,"Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40353,Kyle,"I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40405,Kyle,[approaches with a football] Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40419,Kyle,"Stan? [Stan looks at Kyle, sighs, and walks away] "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40422,Kyle,No! Ah! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40426,Kyle,[sniffs] I got beat up at school... for being different. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40428,Kyle,No! For not being a metrosexual. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40431,Kyle,Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40435,Kyle,Gah! Just leave me alone! [walks away and passes the TV] 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40438,Kyle,GRRRRR!! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40440,Kyle,That does it! I know what I have to do! [walks off] 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40455,Kyle,"One ticket to New York, please. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40457,Kyle,I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40459,Kyle,Mrrh. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40461,Kyle,Mr. Garrison? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40463,Kyle,I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40465,Kyle,Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40467,Kyle,I thought of it first! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40469,Kyle,Did so! Did so! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40471,Kyle,I thought of it two days ago! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40475,Kyle,Cool. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40497,Kyle,Clear! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40546,Kyle,They aren't gay? Then what are they? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40550,Kyle,AAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40564,Kyle,"You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40591,Kyle,No Mr. President!! Don't do it! [the crab man holding him quickly covers his mouth] Help! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40608,Kyle,Mom! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40619,Kyle,What? Y-you want me to hang out with you? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40621,Kyle,"No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40624,Kyle,God-damnit! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40631,Kyle,"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40634,Kyle,I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40638,Kyle,Christian rock?! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40640,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40644,Kyle,"[pointing to an exit] Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40646,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40648,Kyle,[after a few seconds of watching the door] What a stupid asshole! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40673,Kyle,"[enters and stands before them] Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars? "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40675,Kyle,Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40677,Kyle,Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40679,Kyle,"Hold it. [plaintive] Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40681,Kyle,"Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40683,Kyle,[turns and walks off in frustration] Aaaargh! [heads for the front door and opens it. Stan and Kenny approach the entrance. It's night out.] 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40685,Kyle,It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40687,Kyle,Really? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40692,Kyle,"All right, cool. [takes over] Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. [with each name, he clicks on some songs and a download indicator shows download progress for each one. It's an extremely fast connection] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40695,Kyle,"[types in the search box] Judas Priest. [a two-tone bell sound indicates a successful download] Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! [immediately, helicopters are heard coming and the light outside turns bright white. A night sun hovers overhead and stops at a position in which the helicopter pilots can see inside the den. Police sirens are then heard] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40697,Kyle,"I don't know. [drops from the bench and walks over to a window] Let me go check. [an FBI agent crashes through the window, falls and rolls into a standing position, then aims his firearm at the boys. The boys are startled and jump] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40705,Kyle,[being herded into an FBI van with the other boys] I don't know! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40716,Kyle,"[some seconds later] Um, sir- "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40718,Kyle,[rubs the table a bit] We d-didn't think it was that big a deal. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40722,Kyle,What's the matter with him? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40725,Kyle,"We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh... "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40727,Kyle,"So, he's gonna get it, right? "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40760,Kyle,"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40762,Kyle,"Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40767,Kyle,"We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40771,Kyle,"You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40773,Kyle,"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40776,Kyle,Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40814,Kyle,"Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40846,Kyle,"You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40848,Kyle,I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. [a vehicle is heard pulling up. It's a U.S. Mail van. The driver steps out and approaches the crowd] 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40850,Kyle,"[steps down to get the letter] That's us! [the driver hands him the letter and leaves. Kyle opens the envelope and reads] ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."" "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40852,Kyle,"""We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha."" [stands silently for a moment, then hands the letter to Stan and walks forth a bit] He did it. Cartman got a platinum album. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40854,Kyle,He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40856,Kyle,"[turns around and addresses the crowd] Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40858,Kyle,"From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! [grins, but gets no response] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40861,Kyle,[casts his eyes down] Oh. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40863,Kyle,"I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right."" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40870,Kyle,"Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40875,Kyle,This is the worst day of my life. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40881,Kyle,"Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy! "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40902,Kyle,"[jabs Cartman and says in hushed tones] You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died! "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40976,Kyle,It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40979,Kyle,"Dude, look! "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40982,Kyle,I don't know. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40984,Kyle,"Dude, is that your dad? "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40989,Kyle,I can't understand him. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40999,Kyle,Why are they all out driving at the same time? 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41005,Kyle,Aah! There's another one! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41037,Kyle,"[to the other boys] Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41135,Kyle,They're saying something about taking over the entire country. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41144,Kyle,"We can't fight them, Cartman. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41146,Kyle,Country Kitchen Buffet? 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41148,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman! "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41151,Kyle,"Even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41200,Kyle,"[enters excitedly, his arms up in the air] You guys! You guys! I have awesome news! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41202,Kyle,"No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41207,Kyle,It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41209,Kyle,Who said I'm inviting you? [this freezes Cartman for a few seconds] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41211,Kyle,Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41213,Kyle,"I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41215,Kyle,Because Butters isn't a total dick to me! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41217,Kyle,[rolls his eyes] Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41219,Kyle,"[thinks back and counts the number of times Cartman has ripped on him for being a Jew][in the playground. Craig is there instead of Kenny] Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew![in the playground, by the school's back doors] You're a Jew![in Cartman's room. Cartman is wearing a crown] Shut your God-damned Jew mouth![at Kyle's house, on the front steps] Good job, Jew![singing the Dreidel song with Kyle's family and Stan] Jew...[leaving his seat in class] Shut up, Jew![at Cartman's house, with outfits] You're Jewish!![seated on a curb with the other boys] Dude, he's Jewish![staking out a house] Jew![on Nightline, seated next to Stan] Jew![in Cartman's dining room] Jew![at the side of a road, with Tweek and with their parents] Jew![next to stacks of lumber, as Kyle is about to whack him] Jew![at a barn, through a hole on the roof] Jew![Stan's room. Kyle reads a Bible] Jew?![At the Costa Rican rainforest, during practice] ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!"" "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41221,Kyle,"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. [turns and walks away, but Cartman stays close] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41223,Kyle,"[crosses his arms and avoids Cartman's eyes] Sorry, my mind's made up. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41229,Kyle,"I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41233,Kyle,"[studies Cartman a bit, but isn't impressed] That isn't it, Cartman. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41235,Kyle,That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41237,Kyle,I know you don't. [steps back and slams the door on Cartman's face] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41250,Kyle,Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? [turns and walks on his way] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41253,Kyle,"Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! [approaches a table with Kenny, Stan, and Butters] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41259,Kyle,Well? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41261,Kyle,How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41263,Kyle,"Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41265,Kyle,I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41267,Kyle,"Eh... hey, Cartman? [Cartman turns around] You really don't care that you can't go? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41269,Kyle,"That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41271,Kyle,"And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41310,Kyle,Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41312,Kyle,"Yeah, screw him. Let's go. [the door bell rings and Kyle looks at the door] Oh, finally! [walks to get the door, but sees Cartman instead] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41314,Kyle,"Oh. Thanks, dude. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41316,Kyle,Oh wait. Cartman. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41318,Kyle,Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41320,Kyle,I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41322,Kyle,"All right, let's go. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41327,Kyle,Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41330,Kyle,"Aw dude, weak. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41332,Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41335,Kyle,"Nah, I can't. We should help look for him. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41340,Kyle,Yeah. And then we can try the football field. [exits] 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41414,Kyle,"Yeah, it's pretty cool. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41437,Kyle,"Oh, awesome. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41440,Kyle,What? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41442,Kyle,What? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41445,Kyle,"[approaches Cartman, who turns around] I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41449,Kyle,"It's too late, fatass. [Cartman stops] They'll be here in less than a minute. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41451,Kyle,[rises and turns around] Cartman! 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41455,Kyle,"Cartman! [the boys and Sheila trace his path and close in on Cartman. Cartman runs up along the side of the ""cliff"" until he gets to the top, where two other officers meet him] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41458,Kyle,"Jesus Christ! [Cartman ends up face down in the water, which isn't deep enough to drown him. He flips over and coughs. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41466,Kyle,"[quietly, to Stan] Oh, dude, what a little asshole! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41476,Kyle,"Dude, that new kid is such a douche! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41483,Kyle,"Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41498,Kyle,[back in the crowd] What are they doing? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41500,Kyle,"What happened? [Stan glances back, then looks at Kyle] "
7,12,All About Mormons,41505,Kyle,You're having dinner with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41675,Kyle,"Yeah. Did you make out with him, too? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41699,Kyle,Wow! 
7,12,All About Mormons,41790,Kyle,"Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary? "
7,13,Butt Out,41804,Kyle,[rolls his eyes] Oh no... 
7,13,Butt Out,41817,Kyle,"Dude, this is unbearable. "
7,13,Butt Out,41842,Kyle,"Aw dude, this is really hard. "
7,13,Butt Out,41844,Kyle,"Throw 'em away! [the boys' faces are red. Kyle glances back] Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. [the boys stifle their coughs as Mr. Mackey draws near.] "
7,13,Butt Out,41849,Kyle,[looks] D'awww sick! [Stan coughs and tries to cover his mouth] 
7,13,Butt Out,41860,Kyle,Oh God... [looks down. One of the parents knocks.] 
7,13,Butt Out,41872,Kyle,[seizing the opportunity] Yeah. This is really their fault. 
7,13,Butt Out,41878,Kyle,[to Stan] Who's Rob Reiner? 
7,13,Butt Out,41884,Kyle,"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke. "
7,13,Butt Out,41888,Kyle,"Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now? "
7,13,Butt Out,41895,Kyle,Oh no... 
7,13,Butt Out,41899,Kyle,"But... isn't that, kind of, lying? "
7,13,Butt Out,41913,Kyle,What?? 
7,13,Butt Out,41929,Kyle,"So, tobacco helped to build America. "
7,13,Butt Out,41933,Kyle,That sounds perfectly reasonable. 
7,13,Butt Out,41952,Kyle,"But dude, you're making stuff up. "
7,13,Butt Out,41963,Kyle,"Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now! "
7,13,Butt Out,41965,Kyle,"This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something. "
7,13,Butt Out,41969,Kyle,Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial. 
7,13,Butt Out,41971,Kyle,"No, we really want nothing more to do with these people. "
7,13,Butt Out,41975,Kyle,What are you doing? [Cartman snaps his head around and looks] 
7,13,Butt Out,41977,Kyle,"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. [walks around Cartman, opens the door, goes under lumber obstruction, enters the bedroom, then closes the door. Cartman is a bit surprised]  "
7,13,Butt Out,41996,Kyle,Who's going to kill you? 
7,13,Butt Out,41999,Kyle,"Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. [the boys leave the table] "
7,13,Butt Out,42001,Kyle,"[the other boys back away] No dude, get away! "
7,13,Butt Out,42011,Kyle,Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself! 
7,13,Butt Out,42013,Kyle,Yeah dude. You were totally wrong. 
7,13,Butt Out,42017,Kyle,No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded. 
7,13,Butt Out,42019,Kyle,"Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula! "
7,13,Butt Out,42022,Kyle,God-damnit! [Cartman hides behind Mr. Harris upon seeing Rob Reiner] 
7,13,Butt Out,42031,Kyle,"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate- [to Stan] See, I knew it. "
7,13,Butt Out,42033,Kyle,"You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole! "
7,13,Butt Out,42044,Kyle,No. 
7,13,Butt Out,42050,Kyle,"No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! [walks off] "
7,14,Raisins,42068,Kyle,"Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up! [The boys get back into their playing positions. A few moments Kyle looks back] Stan? [Clyde looks back, then Cartman] "
7,14,Raisins,42073,Kyle,[not looking up] Why? 
7,14,Raisins,42075,Kyle,"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework. "
7,14,Raisins,42077,Kyle,"[puts his book down and sighs] God damn it! [walks over to Wendy, but avoids eye contact] Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. [Wendy turns around] "
7,14,Raisins,42079,Kyle,"'Kay. [walks back to Stan, but avoids looking at him, as well] She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you. "
7,14,Raisins,42081,Kyle,"[goes for his books and picks them up] No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. [walks off. Jimmy appears] "
7,14,Raisins,42099,Kyle,"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live. "
7,14,Raisins,42102,Kyle,"Dude, not now! [Cartman looks down, embarrassed] "
7,14,Raisins,42104,Kyle,"Jeez, he's worse than I thought. "
7,14,Raisins,42107,Kyle,No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins. 
7,14,Raisins,42117,Kyle,"What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh? "
7,14,Raisins,42135,Kyle,"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh? [a Raisins girl walks by with long black hair] Why don't you say hi to her? [calls out] Excuse me? [motions for her to come over] "
7,14,Raisins,42137,Kyle,"Hey. Uh, this is Stan. "
7,14,Raisins,42144,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, come on you guys. [they all hop off their seats and walk off] "
7,14,Raisins,42157,Kyle,"Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there. "
7,14,Raisins,42161,Kyle,What are you doing? 
7,14,Raisins,42191,Kyle,"[returns] Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball. "
7,14,Raisins,42193,Kyle,"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Tolkien. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life? "
7,14,Raisins,42195,Kyle,"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time! "
7,14,Raisins,42282,Kyle,"Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?! "
7,14,Raisins,42284,Kyle,"God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home! "
7,14,Raisins,42287,Kyle,"Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy! "
7,14,Raisins,42289,Kyle,"Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back! "
7,14,Raisins,42291,Kyle,Yeah. She is. 
7,14,Raisins,42294,Kyle,"[walks away, defeated] Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable. "
7,14,Raisins,42354,Kyle,"[prepares to receive the football] Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play! "
7,14,Raisins,42356,Kyle,What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain? 
7,14,Raisins,42358,Kyle,"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42363,Kyle,No Ike! Shh! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42397,Kyle,[frightened] Ike's not my little brother anymore? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42402,Kyle,"Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay? "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42410,Kyle,"You'd better! [Harry closes the car door and goes to his side, then settles in to drive. The car lunges forward on square wheels. Kyle looks as Ike goes away. Ike looks back] Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? If he knew the situation, he might be- "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42415,Kyle,"Guys. [the other boys turn to face him] Guys, I need your help. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42417,Kyle,"It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42420,Kyle,"Please, you guys, you don't understand. [walks off some distance] My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42424,Kyle,"[returns] I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then- "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42443,Kyle,What? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42448,Kyle,[to Stan] Is that true? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42451,Kyle,"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42453,Kyle,"It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42455,Kyle,[reassuring] We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42459,Kyle,"Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42461,Kyle,"Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42463,Kyle,Four. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42465,Kyle,How about fifty daura? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42467,Kyle,Fifty-five daura. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42469,Kyle,Okay. Sixty daura. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42471,Kyle,Okay. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42473,Kyle,Got it. [hangs up] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42480,Kyle,Why not? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42482,Kyle,"You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42489,Kyle,All right! We're going to Canada! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42495,Kyle,"Hey, where the hell are you going?? [Mr. Kim jumps out and away. A few seconds later he pulls the rip cord and the parachute comes out] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42497,Kyle,I'm trying! [the plane bounces around in the air] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42503,Kyle,No. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42505,Kyle,Hey! We're in Canada! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42510,Kyle,"Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back? "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42516,Kyle,Who's that? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42522,Kyle,"Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is? "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42524,Kyle,So how do we get to Ottawa? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42533,Kyle,Word! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42540,Kyle,Who are you? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42548,Kyle,"That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42554,Kyle,French Canada? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42562,Kyle,We don't have time for this. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42564,Kyle,Hello? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42567,Kyle,"Okay, you can come with us. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42589,Kyle,"God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42592,Kyle,"Can we just get going, please? "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42602,Kyle,There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42609,Kyle,Well come on! [everyone hops into the boat] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42611,Kyle,Do you think we can still make it in time? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42619,Kyle,We need to see the new Prime Minister. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42623,Kyle,No. No!! [knocks on the door again. Steve and the Mime turn around] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42625,Kyle,"Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42627,Kyle,[turns around and walks off slowly] Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. [sits down on the steps farther away from the door] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42634,Kyle,[turns around] Really? [the boys stand and approach the doors] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42638,Kyle,"[after a few moments, steps forth] Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was- "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42640,Kyle,Ike! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42643,Kyle,"Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. [Harry and Elise look at each other] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42649,Kyle,But why are you making such strange laws?? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42653,Kyle,"[walks over to the charred remains] You... bastards! [brushes off a bit of Kenny from his jacket] Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred? [Stan dusts himself off] And, and takes away mounties' horses? [Stan notices a purple curtain nearby and walks over to it] And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42655,Kyle,"[the other members of the group gather in, as well as other people nearby] What the hell?? "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42671,Kyle,"Well yeah, but ah-I got my brother back. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42673,Kyle,"Dude, come on. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42680,Kyle,"[stops so he doesn't get hurt and glares] Stop it, Cartman! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42682,Kyle,"[stops] Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! [Cartman cackles some more. The boys approach a booth: Roger's Edge] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42685,Kyle,"[softly] Wow, cool. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42688,Kyle,"[turns away] Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. [the others turn as well] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42700,Kyle,Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42705,Kyle,Kaii yo! [one end of his nunchaku hits his hat a few times] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42708,Kyle,"Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku [he transforms], a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42717,Kyle,"[cautions] No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42719,Kyle,"[the background is a motion blur] You don't know anything about Jews, fatass! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42723,Kyle,I still say this is a bad idea. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42732,Kyle,But don't tell anybody we have them. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42759,Kyle,"Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42761,Kyle,"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42764,Kyle,No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42766,Kyle,"That doesn't count, fatass! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42770,Kyle,Who the hell is that? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42773,Kyle,Whoa. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42781,Kyle,"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! [whips them around a few times and unleashes an icy stream of energy towards Butters. The blasts knock Butters out of the air and he hits the ground with a thud.] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42784,Kyle,"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42786,Kyle,God dammit Cartman! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42793,Kyle,"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42796,Kyle,Oh man! We are in serious trouble! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42802,Kyle,I agree with Cartman! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42804,Kyle,You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42808,Kyle,Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42811,Kyle,"If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42813,Kyle,"[moves off] God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42821,Kyle,Oh no. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42825,Kyle,"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42831,Kyle,"We need some more fur. [Stan walks over to Sparky and shaves off fur from areas of his body still unshaved, then walks back to Kyle and hands him the fur. Kyle places the fur on Butters' left leg] I think that's good. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42839,Kyle,"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! [some trash bin noises are heard and the boys face the source of the noises] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42841,Kyle,"Quick, hide Butters! [Cartman drags Butters to an oven] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42854,Kyle,"He said, not now, Craig! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42862,Kyle,I swore to never fight again. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42867,Kyle,Oh no. Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42871,Kyle,"[approaches Craig] Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42881,Kyle,Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42889,Kyle,Hey Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42891,Kyle,"Dude, look! [a black man walks up in anime form, stops, and looks around] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42897,Kyle,"Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42901,Kyle,"Yeah, we know. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42912,Kyle,Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42919,Kyle,"It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! [moves off] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42921,Kyle,"[reaches a well and holds his nunchucks over it] Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42924,Kyle,"We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42926,Kyle,"Screw you, fatass! [struggles to loosen his grip on the nunchucks] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42928,Kyle,[walks up next to Stan] I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I... 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42942,Kyle,"Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42947,Kyle,Where?! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42949,Kyle,Then it's not too late! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42954,Kyle,We have to get past them! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42956,Kyle,You have that power too? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42965,Kyle,"Oh dude, we are gonna get it now. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42978,Kyle,"Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42980,Kyle,"[looks around, then stands on his chair] Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42984,Kyle,"Yeah, I c- I can't believe it. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42986,Kyle,[pulls out his nunchucks] So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons. 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,42996,Kyle,They're Olympic games for handicapped people. 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43000,Kyle,"Yeah, that'd be cool. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43002,Kyle,"Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43005,Kyle,"...You're an asshole, Cartman. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43035,Kyle,What? 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43039,Kyle,"Oh no. Cartman, no! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43043,Kyle,[moves and catches up to Cartman] Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43045,Kyle,Because! [takes away the brochure] 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43070,Kyle,[low voice] God damn you! 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43072,Kyle,"No you're not! [whips out the brochure] I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43074,Kyle,"It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! [grins confidently. Cartman looks at him, then at the brochure and reads] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43158,Kyle,"Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. [they look at each other and Cartman closes a book he had open for reference] "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43160,Kyle,"I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it! "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43162,Kyle,"I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!  "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43164,Kyle,I came here to talk about you! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43235,Kyle,I'm a Vulcan! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43237,Kyle,"[looking into an imaginary viewer] The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43239,Kyle,No! I'm on the away team too! [he and Kenny remove their belts] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43241,Kyle,I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43247,Kyle,I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. [Cartman sighs silently] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43249,Kyle,[stops firing and stands still] No it doesn't. [the other boys continue with their phaser noises] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43251,Kyle,"No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43253,Kyle,"Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43256,Kyle,He does not! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43258,Kyle,Naw uh! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43262,Kyle,I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43264,Kyle,People don't hate the Jews! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43266,Kyle,...You're a stupid asshole! [turns and walks off. Cartman turns left and glances at Kyle] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43269,Kyle,One please. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43271,Kyle,"Yeah, I know, but I have to- "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43273,Kyle,"...Thanks. [makes his way towards the doors, glancing back at the cashier in wonder] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43278,Kyle,Haaaah! [Next scene has Kyle with his eyes squeezed shut and his hands over his face. He's now curled up in a ball] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43281,Kyle,How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43293,Kyle,"You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43295,Kyle,"You were, you were right? "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43297,Kyle,You were right. [Cartman opens his eyes and beams brightly] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43331,Kyle,"Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! [a spear pierces Jesus' side. The one piercing him is Kyle himself, who seems to be relishing this, as he pierces Jesus a few more times. A review of images, then an image of Alan Alda, and Kyle wakes up frightened. After a few screams he looks around] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43404,Kyle,"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43406,Kyle,"Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43408,Kyle,"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43410,Kyle,But how can the Jews make it better?? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43412,Kyle,"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course. [gets off the chair] I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. [turns and walks out] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43448,Kyle,"Thank you, rabbi. [Sheila smiles and gets Gerald's attention. Kyle clears his throat.] In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43451,Kyle,"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43454,Kyle,I saw The Passion! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43485,Kyle,"[to his parents] Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43492,Kyle,"[facing the congregants] No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob! [behind him Cartman is seen leading his mob to the theater] The last time we did that we killed Jesus! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43503,Kyle,"[noticing] Look out!! [The crowds move to the other side of the street as the tour bus skids to a stop just past the theater. Mel Gibson roars into town and crashes into the ticket booth, and his gas truck blows up. The crowds crawl out of their safety places and merge] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43510,Kyle,"[joins Stan and Kenny] Dude, what's wrong with him? "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43513,Kyle,Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43521,Kyle,"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. [a grinning Mel squats and farts on Cartman, defecating on Cartman] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43525,Kyle,Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. [Stan's car is uncooperative] 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43527,Kyle,"Hey, who are those kids? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43552,Kyle,...What the hell just happened? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43559,Kyle,Yeah. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43587,Kyle,"Dude, that is a sweet RC car! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43592,Kyle,"We're not interested, thanks. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43604,Kyle,Yeah! Go Stan! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43607,Kyle,All right Stan! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43610,Kyle,Yeah! You got served! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43613,Kyle,That's right! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43991,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing, fatass? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43994,Kyle,Why? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43996,Kyle,Why? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44007,Kyle,"Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O, [Cartman stops] I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44210,Kyle,"Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44212,Kyle,[points] Hey Look! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44216,Kyle,Hey. Do you live here? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44235,Kyle,"Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44249,Kyle,[softly] What's wrong with his face? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44257,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44259,Kyle,Mr. Jefferson? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44266,Kyle,Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44294,Kyle,"Dude, what happened to your knee? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44296,Kyle,[calls out] Mr. Jefferson! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44299,Kyle,"Mr- ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. [takes Blanket inside] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44301,Kyle,"Alright, this is gonna sting for a second. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44304,Kyle,"I know, I know. Be cool. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44307,Kyle,"So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44310,Kyle,And where is your mom? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44312,Kyle,You must have a mom. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44314,Kyle,"You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44316,Kyle,What? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44318,Kyle,So you never met your mom? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44320,Kyle,"Yeah. Yeah, that counts. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44323,Kyle,"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44325,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44347,Kyle,They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44392,Kyle,"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44394,Kyle,He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44396,Kyle,What?! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44405,Kyle,"Come on, Blanket. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44477,Kyle,[stops] That poor kid. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44481,Kyle,"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44488,Kyle,"[the boys fear for Blanket's life] Jesus Christ, dude! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44491,Kyle,"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44526,Kyle,"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44530,Kyle,[seething as he climbs the ladder] I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! [Stan and Kenny follow] 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44535,Kyle,"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? [Kenny looks around] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44560,Kyle,"Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44579,Kyle,You bastard! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44583,Kyle,[grabs Blanket's hand and leaves as well] Come on! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44588,Kyle,"[Kyle and Stan help Blanket up] Hang on, Blanket! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44596,Kyle,"[returns with Blanket] All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit! Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44601,Kyle,All right! Things just might work out! 
8,7,Goobacks,44614,Kyle,You've been on your fucking phone since we started! 
8,7,Goobacks,44616,Kyle,A break from what?! You haven't done anything! 
8,7,Goobacks,44618,Kyle,All you ever do is talk about your balls! 
8,7,Goobacks,44620,Kyle,"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us! "
8,7,Goobacks,44657,Kyle,Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it. 
8,7,Goobacks,44659,Kyle,Dude. [the camera pulls back to show these immigrants shoveling snow off sidewalks and driveways up and down the street] 
8,7,Goobacks,44712,Kyle,What?! 
8,7,Goobacks,44715,Kyle,"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language! "
8,7,Goobacks,44741,Kyle,"Aw, dude. "
8,7,Goobacks,44816,Kyle,[drops his shovel] This is really gay. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44855,Kyle,"Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Giant Douche."" "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44859,Kyle,Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44861,Kyle,"It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44863,Kyle,"Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44866,Kyle,"Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44868,Kyle,"[tallies the votes. Behind him, Butters approaches his locker and prepares to open it] That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44871,Kyle,You hate Butters. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44874,Kyle,"You misled him, fatass! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44877,Kyle,"Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44879,Kyle,A giant douche. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44883,Kyle,Giant douche. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44887,Kyle,A giant douche. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44893,Kyle,"All right, it's decided. Let's all write in ""Giant Douche."" "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44902,Kyle,Cartman? What the hell?! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44906,Kyle,"You won't get more votes than us, asshole! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44910,Kyle,Be sure to vote for Giant Douche. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44912,Kyle,Giant Douche is your man! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44914,Kyle,"Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. [something like an ice cream truck is heard, and Cartman appears driving his Big Wheels bike, pulling a portable stage. Butters is dancing on the stage, dressed as a Hawaiian hula dancer. In his hands he has leis to hand out.] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44916,Kyle,There. Do you really want that asshole to win? 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44918,Kyle,"What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44920,Kyle,"Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44978,Kyle,"You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44980,Kyle,"Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44982,Kyle,"Woah... wait, what are you doing? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44984,Kyle,"No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44986,Kyle,"...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44988,Kyle,"Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44990,Kyle,"Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?! [calls out to] Puffy! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45010,Kyle,"Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal? [Stan sighs, but says nothing more in response] Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45089,Kyle,"Ha! You lose, fatass! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45113,Kyle,"That is fucking stupid, Cartman! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45124,Kyle,Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45135,Kyle,Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45137,Kyle,"You only need one copy, r-tard! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45139,Kyle,"Okay, fine, I will! [grabs a copy] H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! [puts it back] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45158,Kyle,"Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. [they pass by a man closing up his shop for the last time] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45160,Kyle,"Why, Mr. Farkle? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45162,Kyle,"[glares at Cartman] Cartman, stop it! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45165,Kyle,"See?! That sucks, dude! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45167,Kyle,"Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores? [Cartman whips out the violin and plays it again] And what about all the- [looks at Cartman, takes away his violin, breaks it in half using his leg, and throws the pieces to the ground] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45171,Kyle,"What the hell? [before them is a downtown that is shuttered and decayed. The asphalt is gone from the roads and eagles hover over the area. A window crashing makes them jump, and Butters appears around a corner, making weird noises.] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45173,Kyle,Butters? What the hell are you doing? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45190,Kyle,But you run the Wall-Mart. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45194,Kyle,"You hate Wall-Mart, too? [rumbles emanate from the walls] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45225,Kyle,"No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45231,Kyle,[looking at Cartman] It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45233,Kyle,"Dude, our town is going to be better without the- [sounds of construction are heard. Kyle turns to look. ] What the? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45235,Kyle,"How... How did this happen? [the other boys make their way to the store, then look around at the restored store, which is running as if nothing had happened the night before. Kyle's parents are shopping there, and they run into the boys.] Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45243,Kyle,Hey! Hey! [the driver looks at them] Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45245,Kyle,But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45249,Kyle,"Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45254,Kyle,No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45256,Kyle,"Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, ""Haha! I was working for Wall-Mart all along!"" or something. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45259,Kyle,"All right, fine. Come on, fatass! [leaves to catch up with Stan.] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45261,Kyle,[rushes out to face Cartman] I heard that! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45263,Kyle,You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45266,Kyle,He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45268,Kyle,God-damnit! [turns and heads towards Stan] 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45273,Kyle,It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45277,Kyle,Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45279,Kyle,We want to talk to who's in charge. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45284,Kyle,So how do we stop it? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45288,Kyle,The heart of Wall-Mart? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45294,Kyle,All right. C'mon you guys. We have to get back home. [they drop down and leave the room] 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45299,Kyle,"All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45301,Kyle,I knew you were! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45303,Kyle,"Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45305,Kyle,"Yes, I did! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45307,Kyle,"Yes, I did! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45309,Kyle,"Yes, I did! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45311,Kyle,"Yes. I did! [a few more rounds of this and they stand head to head, silent] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45313,Kyle,[interrupting] -slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I- [Cartman babbles loudly to drown him out] -and I told you that- 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45315,Kyle,"[he and Stan walk around Cartman] We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! [Kenny does as told] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45320,Kyle,"We've gotta find the television department. [the lights flicker and turn off. Randy leaps into view in front of the boys, carrying an ax. Stan and Kyle scream] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45330,Kyle,I think I see the television department in the back! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45340,Kyle,Who are you? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45345,Kyle,Where's the heart? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45351,Kyle,"The question is, ""Where is the heart?"" "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45361,Kyle,The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out NOW! [the shoppers and employees now bolt for the doors and run out as an M in Mart falls down.] 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45365,Kyle,All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45368,Kyle,Duh. 
8,10,Pre-School,45379,Kyle,"Okay, hang on a second I- "
8,10,Pre-School,45381,Kyle,"All right, all right! [Stan pulls him further away until there's no one around them] Dude, what is the matter with you? "
8,10,Pre-School,45384,Kyle,Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?! 
8,10,Pre-School,45386,Kyle,"Oh, no! No! "
8,10,Pre-School,45388,Kyle,Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
8,10,Pre-School,45390,Kyle,Yeah. 
8,10,Pre-School,45397,Kyle,"Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool. "
8,10,Pre-School,45400,Kyle,"Totally, dude, let's play Fireman. "
8,10,Pre-School,45402,Kyle,"Shut up, fat ass! "
8,10,Pre-School,45407,Kyle,"Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! [a shot of Trent beating up another kid with a play hammer. He delivers two blows] "
8,10,Pre-School,45413,Kyle,Do you know how to start a fire? 
8,10,Pre-School,45416,Kyle,We're firemen! 
8,10,Pre-School,45425,Kyle,Code 7! Bring in the firemen! 
8,10,Pre-School,45428,Kyle,[smiles] We saved the school! 
8,10,Pre-School,45437,Kyle,My mom is gonna break my legs! 
8,10,Pre-School,45442,Kyle,Not us. We're good kids. 
8,10,Pre-School,45449,Kyle,"Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us! "
8,10,Pre-School,45456,Kyle,"We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident! "
8,10,Pre-School,45461,Kyle,"Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it. "
8,10,Pre-School,45505,Kyle,That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years! 
8,10,Pre-School,45513,Kyle,"Dude, we shouldn't be here! "
8,10,Pre-School,45518,Kyle,We need you to protect us... from a bully. 
8,10,Pre-School,45522,Kyle,"Well... [the fourth-graders take a step back] Well, what do you want? "
8,10,Pre-School,45535,Kyle,Wait! We'll do it. 
8,10,Pre-School,45556,Kyle,Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes? 
8,10,Pre-School,45560,Kyle,"What else has big round squishy globes? [they look at Cartman, who looks up into space] "
8,10,Pre-School,45563,Kyle,"[checks the book] No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? [holds the book out for the others to see.] "
8,10,Pre-School,45568,Kyle,Oh wait! We forgot the necklace. 
8,10,Pre-School,45570,Kyle,"[lowers the camera] God, I hope this works. "
8,10,Pre-School,45583,Kyle,"[the boys look at each other] Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett? "
8,10,Pre-School,45593,Kyle,[after some thought] Naw. 
8,10,Pre-School,45595,Kyle,"Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up! "
8,10,Pre-School,45609,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! [the leader suffers a cramp and groans] "
8,10,Pre-School,45616,Kyle,We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible! 
8,10,Pre-School,45618,Kyle,From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders. 
8,10,Pre-School,45631,Kyle,So you're gonna help us? 
8,10,Pre-School,45643,Kyle,"The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids. "
8,10,Pre-School,45652,Kyle,"Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! [the boys back up some more, away from the intersection] "
8,10,Pre-School,45666,Kyle,"Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45695,Kyle,"[at a small desk, for Sports] Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45703,Kyle,What?! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45730,Kyle,"Geez, all that from a stupid video show. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45745,Kyle,"[turns back to the table] Gah, I just don't get it. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45748,Kyle,"Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45753,Kyle,How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45757,Kyle,Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45765,Kyle,Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45785,Kyle,"[at a different, flashier desk] Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman [his picture is shown], pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner [her picture is shown] stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45804,Kyle,We're making the news more appealing to students. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45810,Kyle,We beat Close-up Animals! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45824,Kyle,"Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45827,Kyle,"What if we do a show where we- [stops] Uh, no. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45834,Kyle,Uhhh. What if the-? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45846,Kyle,Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45848,Kyle,That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45851,Kyle,How do we know which one to use? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45858,Kyle,It's not? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45860,Kyle,"Oh, okay. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45871,Kyle,"[handing out a few things] All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil. [Stan, Tolkien, and Cartman are on the floor] and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45874,Kyle,"Stan? [Stan's eyes have glazed over and he looks stupefied. From Stan's point of view, the whole world changes. Kyle now has a wolf head with yellow eyes.] Dude, Stan, you all right? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45882,Kyle,[with modulated voice] Me too! [they quickly write their ideas down in their notepads] 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45888,Kyle,"I could watch this for days. [They are unknowingly watching Craig's show, Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens Wearing Hats] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45892,Kyle,Ah! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45894,Kyle,"Butters, get away from me! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45898,Kyle,I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45902,Kyle,"Jesus, you may be right. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45914,Kyle,"[steps into view in front of Cartman, who has his arms crossed] So where are students getting all this cough medicine?? [Cartman uncrosses his arms and puts his fists on his hips. Kyle puts his hands behind his back] This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist! [it's the footage from their own visit to the pharmacist for the medicine] Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! [a shot of the pharmacist being escorted out of the store and into a cruiser. Officer Barbrady takes part in the arrest] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45921,Kyle,Twenty-two people?! All right! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45932,Kyle,"Dude, bail? "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46240,Kyle,[arrives in time to see Cartman's attempt] What's going on? 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46242,Kyle,Do it! Do it! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46246,Kyle,"Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46248,Kyle,"Awww, go on and do it already! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46325,Kyle,"[walks up. Other kids gather behind him] Cartman, what did you do?! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46327,Kyle,Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46329,Kyle,"Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46331,Kyle,You don't have any powers! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46334,Kyle,He can't do crap! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46341,Kyle,Ha! You see?! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46343,Kyle,What?! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46349,Kyle,This is fuckin' ridiculous! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46355,Kyle,What the hell is wrong with these people?! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46357,Kyle,Hey! What about this guy?! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46361,Kyle,"Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46397,Kyle,"[arriving with Stan and Kenny] Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis. [holds out his findings] I'm pretty sure he's your man. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46399,Kyle,No. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46401,Kyle,Why won't anybody listen to me?! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46403,Kyle,"[shrugs Kenny off] I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46407,Kyle,Be sure to take me to the same hospital! 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46410,Kyle,"All right, here we go. [spreads his wings] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! [jumps off and lands on the ground below] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46444,Kyle,"I see... a man... with a baseball cap. [Sgt. Lou snaps his fingers and Det. Murphy whips out a notepad and pen and starts taking notes. Kyle concentrates] He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46493,Kyle,"No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46499,Kyle,"[irritated] Just stop it! [at the top of his lungs] Stoop iiit!! [the lights go out as the bulbs shatter, then the shelf above his bed falls and everything on it hits the floor. The psychics and Cartman stop their battle and witness all this] There's a logical explanation for that. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46710,Kyle,[gets up and turns around] What the hell? 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46712,Kyle,My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46714,Kyle,"Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46717,Kyle,No. I'm Jewish. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46721,Kyle,Huh? 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46736,Kyle,"[now tied to the altar, frightened] Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46759,Kyle,"[looks down] No. [walks towards the manger] No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46761,Kyle,"[now in the manger, behind the trough] With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46764,Kyle,"[returns to the altar, climbs up, and exults] Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46765,Kyle,"[voice-over] Oh, stop it, Cartman! [the spell is broken] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46767,Kyle,Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46769,Kyle,This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46778,Kyle,"Dude, why do you care?! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46780,Kyle,Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46784,Kyle,"All right, fine! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46787,Kyle,"HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the -- [feels something...] Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this! [hops off the altar] I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46789,Kyle,"Oh God, what have I done?! [sits down] I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46801,Kyle,"Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46813,Kyle,"[voice-over] Goddammit, Cartman! "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46834,Kyle,How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46837,Kyle,"[points right at Cartman] I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! [a referee's whistle is heard] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46841,Kyle,Yeah? 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46843,Kyle,Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46845,Kyle,Oo whataya mean? 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46850,Kyle,I know. I deserve it. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46852,Kyle,"You're right. [this disarms Cartman completely, and he walks away] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46863,Kyle,But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. [Mrs. Garrison appears before them] 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46868,Kyle,Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation? 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46870,Kyle,"But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come? "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46878,Kyle,Yeah. That's right. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46880,Kyle,Totally! I totally understand! 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46884,Kyle,"Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46886,Kyle,"Well, do you also do other surgeries like that? "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46888,Kyle,"No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46890,Kyle,I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46892,Kyle,Yeah! [big grin] 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46912,Kyle,Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. [they look up. On Gerald's T-shirt is a picture of two dolphins jumping in the air] 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46914,Kyle,"Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. [shows the paper, which is a picture of ] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46916,Kyle,"[quite excited] Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I?? "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46918,Kyle,[let down] But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46920,Kyle,"Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46922,Kyle,Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it? 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46924,Kyle,But Jews can't play basketball! [this sets Gerald off and making him furious] 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46926,Kyle,"[leaves the room and goes up the stairs, stopping halfway] I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! [continues up the stairs and goes to his room. His door is heard being shut. Gerald looks on as all this happens] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46971,Kyle,"Yeah, but it was totally worth it. [Butters arrives with the other boys] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46973,Kyle,"Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again! "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46975,Kyle," Alright, Dad! [trots off] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47013,Kyle,"[panting] Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47015,Kyle,"Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now? "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47017,Kyle,"All right! [turns around and looks up the bleachers] Dad, I can play! [Gerald is on the steps with his walker] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47031,Kyle,"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! [The stitches along his upper chest, arms, and cheeks are seen. The camera pans down to show the bandages on his elbows and knees and the stitches along his legs] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47049,Kyle,All right! [stands and feels pain in his knees. He soothes them] Ow. Hm. [goes to the locker room] 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47065,Kyle,I got it! I got the ball. [runs to his basket] 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47076,Kyle,But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47105,Kyle,"Hey, let's ask them. [the boys are wearing shoulder totes with magazines peeking out from them.] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47108,Kyle,Wha- whataya mean? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47114,Kyle,Ugh! Those dirty liars! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47162,Kyle,"Yeah, we're pissed off. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47165,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47204,Kyle,You said it! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47259,Kyle,"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47264,Kyle,"Yeah, it's called a town. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47307,Kyle,You're doing what? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47334,Kyle,We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47360,Kyle,"Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us. "
9,3,Wing,47374,Kyle,How come we never get opportunities like that? 
9,3,Wing,47376,Kyle,We're not talented? 
9,3,Wing,47380,Kyle,Probably. 
9,3,Wing,47390,Kyle,Why? 
9,3,Wing,47406,Kyle,Can I talk to you?! [grabs Cartman's shoulder] 
9,3,Wing,47408,Kyle,What the hell are you doing?! 
9,3,Wing,47410,Kyle,Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years! 
9,3,Wing,47412,Kyle,Yes he does! 
9,3,Wing,47414,Kyle,"Tolkien actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass! "
9,3,Wing,47420,Kyle,"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you. "
9,3,Wing,47424,Kyle,"Welcome to the team, Tolkien. "
9,3,Wing,47440,Kyle,We knew you could do it! 
9,3,Wing,47442,Kyle,Twenty dollars. 
9,3,Wing,47461,Kyle,"Mister, you can't do this to us! "
9,3,Wing,47466,Kyle,All that time and effort we spent helping Tolkien and this is the thanks we get?! 
9,3,Wing,47479,Kyle,"Sir, we would love to sign your wife. "
9,3,Wing,47508,Kyle,"Jesus, we made it just in time! [the boys attempt to talk to the attendants] "
9,3,Wing,47513,Kyle,Oh crap! 
9,3,Wing,47519,Kyle,"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well- "
9,3,Wing,47521,Kyle,"Aw, just forget it! [hauls Cartman away. The other boys follow, but Wing doesn't] "
9,3,Wing,47523,Kyle,Goddamnit! Goddamnit! 
9,3,Wing,47527,Kyle,"Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show? "
9,3,Wing,47534,Kyle,"Hey, is your show as good as America Idol? "
9,3,Wing,47546,Kyle,Let's do it Wing! 
9,3,Wing,47550,Kyle,"Oh my God, dude! "
9,3,Wing,47571,Kyle,What? 
9,3,Wing,47574,Kyle,Get out! 
9,3,Wing,47576,Kyle,Woohoo! Yeah! 
9,3,Wing,47584,Kyle,What do you mean? We thought she was with you. 
9,3,Wing,47588,Kyle,Wing? 
9,3,Wing,47590,Kyle,Wing? 
9,3,Wing,47594,Kyle,They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again! 
9,3,Wing,47599,Kyle,"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive. "
9,3,Wing,47606,Kyle,You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?! 
9,3,Wing,47608,Kyle,"You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! [the four guards open fire. the boys look for a place to hide and find shelter behind a counter.] "
9,3,Wing,47611,Kyle,"Dude, maybe we should give up! "
9,3,Wing,47614,Kyle,Cartman! [Cartman runs through the gunfire and makes it to a wall on which rest several guns. He takes one and cocks it. The four guards move down to the floor] 
9,3,Wing,47617,Kyle,Wing? 
9,3,Wing,47619,Kyle,[pulls out a yellow toy car] Stupid talent agents! 
9,3,Wing,47621,Kyle,"[stirs] All right, Kenny, let's go! [stops when nothing happens, then looks] Kenny? [the camera pulls back to show Kenny, shot up and bleeding, dead on the floor] Kenny! [walks over to Kenny with his arms open] Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing. [hugs Kenny, sobbing] We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you! "
9,3,Wing,47623,Kyle,They killed Kenny! 
9,3,Wing,47629,Kyle,She had a contract with us first! We own her! 
9,3,Wing,47631,Kyle,Her life belongs to us! 
9,3,Wing,47633,Kyle,Yeah. 
9,3,Wing,47636,Kyle,Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling. 
9,3,Wing,47639,Kyle,Me too. 
9,3,Wing,47650,Kyle,[notices] Tolkien? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47675,Kyle,That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47678,Kyle,Wuh what'd I do? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47681,Kyle,"Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell."" "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47762,Kyle,Kenny had a will? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47765,Kyle,That's... really touching. 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47778,Kyle,"Oh my God! [he and Stan rush out of there, leaving Cartman incredulous] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47786,Kyle,Kenny! You're alive! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47797,Kyle,He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47799,Kyle,He did not! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47801,Kyle,Did not! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47827,Kyle,Cartman! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47829,Kyle,Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47837,Kyle,[exiting the hospital with Stan] That dirty no-good sonofabitch! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47840,Kyle,How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47843,Kyle,"Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in! "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47847,Kyle,"Yeah, come on! [grabs Kyle and they go away] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47890,Kyle,"We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain! "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47892,Kyle,"You say tomato, but I say Kenny! "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47904,Kyle,"Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47906,Kyle,"Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47908,Kyle,"Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. [everyone walks out.] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47928,Kyle,"[infield, right] This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47936,Kyle,"Aw God, I'm so borrred. [Tolkien yawns over at first base] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47953,Kyle,"Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! [Stan puts on his game face and throws the pitch. Alan swings and misses] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47958,Kyle,No more boring baseball until next year! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47967,Kyle,Nobody said anything about a post-season. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47973,Kyle,I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47982,Kyle,"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48012,Kyle,You hate this game too? 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48018,Kyle,"No, we're gonna get creamed! "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48035,Kyle,"Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. [Stan thinks, then throws the pitch. It goes wide and Cartman catches it] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48061,Kyle,Crud! [the scorekeeper updates the board] 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48099,Kyle,What? 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48134,Kyle,"Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48140,Kyle,I know who. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48144,Kyle,"There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. [the team goes up to greet him] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48146,Kyle,"Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48168,Kyle,You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48189,Kyle,Aw crap! [Stan drops. Kyle 1 goes towards second and no one is stopping him. He passes it] 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48195,Kyle,Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48203,Kyle,"Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out! [the scoreboard is updated in time-lapse: Denver doesn't have a run on there.] Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48225,Kyle,Get up! You have to fight! [Randy is trying] 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48242,Kyle,"God, this is gonna be sooo yummy. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48246,Kyle,She's here! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48248,Kyle,I want some! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48258,Kyle,"[firmly] Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. [Cartman stays behind and quickly sits back down. As the other boys head out of the kitchen, Cartman rips the skins off the chicken pieces and wolfs them down. Sharon and the other boys return with the groceries.] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48260,Kyle,"All right, let's eat Colonel! [Cartman leaves as the others sit] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48263,Kyle,The skin's the best part... 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48267,Kyle,You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48271,Kyle,Hello?? I've been saying this for years! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48273,Kyle,"Yes, but he thrives on that. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48276,Kyle,That sounds great! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48278,Kyle,Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48282,Kyle,Thanks. [Stan returns to his post next to Kenny] 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48298,Kyle,We're ignoring him. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48300,Kyle,Because he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48391,Kyle,There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48400,Kyle,It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48403,Kyle,"He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48525,Kyle,"We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have. "
9,7,Erection Day,48550,Kyle,"Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy. "
9,7,Erection Day,48554,Kyle,"I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people? "
9,7,Erection Day,48556,Kyle,"Huh wuh, what's the matter? "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48856,Kyle,[walks up behind Stan] Hey dudes. [Stan stands to one side so he can see Kyle clearly] 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48858,Kyle,Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48913,Kyle,"[with a cup of water, approaches Stan] Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48915,Kyle,Huh? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48917,Kyle,How do you know that? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48919,Kyle,George Bush? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48921,Kyle,Terrorists? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48923,Kyle,Communists? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48925,Kyle,Chinese radicals? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48927,Kyle,...Cartman? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48929,Kyle,[throws down his cup] Cartman flooded Beaverton?!! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48931,Kyle,"[thinks a bit] Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48933,Kyle,"Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48936,Kyle,How? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48956,Kyle,We can't get out! The flames are too big! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48958,Kyle,"[walks towards Stan] Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents can help us! [Stan looks down, unsure what to do] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49004,Kyle,"Dude, this whole building is going to collapse! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49011,Kyle,"Oh Jesus, we have to hurry! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49014,Kyle,What are you doing? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49016,Kyle,What gold?? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49018,Kyle,"No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49021,Kyle,Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49023,Kyle,"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49025,Kyle,"Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49027,Kyle,"...Okay, fine! Here! [opens his coat and pulls out a small black bag, and hands it to Cartman] Now let's go! "
9,9,Marjorine,49080,Kyle,What are all you guys doing here? 
9,9,Marjorine,49088,Kyle,The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded. 
9,9,Marjorine,49124,Kyle,The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp. 
9,9,Marjorine,49136,Kyle,That's a pretty solid idea. But who? 
9,9,Marjorine,49208,Kyle,"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there. "
9,9,Marjorine,49225,Kyle,"Jesus, what are they doing in there? "
9,9,Marjorine,49255,Kyle,"Dude, it's been too long. Something's wrong. [Craig takes out binoculars to look]   "
9,9,Marjorine,49259,Kyle,"Can you see anything? [the boys see Butters dancing with the other girls to Justin Timberlake's song ""Rock Your Body""] "
9,9,Marjorine,49317,Kyle,Wait! I don't wanna know that! 
9,9,Marjorine,49322,Kyle,"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! [everyone starts arguing] "
9,9,Marjorine,49333,Kyle,It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49400,Kyle,"Hello? Oh, hey, dude. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49402,Kyle,"Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49404,Kyle,I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49441,Kyle,Why? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49449,Kyle,Who? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49452,Kyle,"Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49454,Kyle,"Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg? "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49456,Kyle,"It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49458,Kyle,At who? [the doorbell rings] Heh- hang on. [goes to answer the door and finds Wendy outside] 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49460,Kyle,Huh? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49462,Kyle,"Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49464,Kyle,"Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49466,Kyle,"[consoles her a bit, but turns her away] Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. <>[Stan peeks out from the kitchen and sees Kyle's arm around Wendy] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49468,Kyle,"Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade. [slams the door on her and returns to the kitchen, where an angry Stan is sitting in his chair with his arms crossed] Freakin' weirdos, man. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49470,Kyle,What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49485,Kyle,"Dude, it's totally fine. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49537,Kyle,"Dude, did you hear what's happening? "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49539,Kyle,Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49541,Kyle,"She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right? "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49543,Kyle,"Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49545,Kyle,Impress Wendy?? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49547,Kyle,What the hell are you talking about?! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49551,Kyle,Stan? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49554,Kyle,"Stan? Stan, I think we should talk. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49556,Kyle,"Stan, I don't like Wendy. [Stan's raises his head and listens] All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49558,Kyle,I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49560,Kyle,"Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I. [Stan's raises his head again] I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49562,Kyle,"Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49564,Kyle,"[turns away and walks a few paces] It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you [reaches into his jacket and pulls out an egg] and kept the original safe with me. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49566,Kyle,Yeah dude. I'm sorry. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49568,Kyle,Yeah. And I can still get my A! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49570,Kyle,"Stan... [Stan turns, then he turns away] Do you really think my hat is stupid? "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49581,Kyle,"[in the back seat of a speeding cab with Stan] Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49583,Kyle,Don't fail us! We'll be right there! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49587,Kyle,[pays the cabbie] Thanks dude! [hops out behind Stan] 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49591,Kyle,Keep running! [other people hear the gunfire and look around] 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49593,Kyle,Hang on! Wait! [Jakartha bumps someone aside and starts detonating hidden bombs around the plaza. Groups of people are thrown off in all directions. The Governor begins to pay attention] 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49598,Kyle,[still woozy] Gays can get married? What?? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49602,Kyle,[still confused] What did we do? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49610,Kyle,[annoyed at Cartman's ignorance] What?! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49613,Kyle,"That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49616,Kyle,This is all a bunch of crap! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49619,Kyle,"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49622,Kyle,"Fine, I will! [crosses his arms] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49624,Kyle,Stupid supremacist asswipe! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49626,Kyle,"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49630,Kyle,Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49634,Kyle,"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49643,Kyle,But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. [somber music plays] 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49645,Kyle,I just had a couple more questions about- 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49648,Kyle,"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul, [Cartman yawns] but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. [turns off the projector and goes to his desk amid some applause] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49651,Kyle,"Thanks, Butters. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49655,Kyle,"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49660,Kyle,There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49662,Kyle,[thinks] Hey. [snaps his fingers] That's a great idea! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49664,Kyle,Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49666,Kyle,We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49690,Kyle,"Wow, Cartman. You look... different. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49694,Kyle,Is that an umbrella you're using? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49696,Kyle,"[looks at Stan for a moment] ...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49698,Kyle,"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49702,Kyle,"Dude, this is going awesome. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49713,Kyle,"Dude, check it out. [Stan looks over] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49717,Kyle,"We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49744,Kyle,I don't believe it. 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49748,Kyle,"Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. [he and Stan return to their tetherball game] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49782,Kyle,"Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49784,Kyle,"Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49786,Kyle,Are you in? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49791,Kyle,Oh... hey there. [long silence] 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49793,Kyle,"Let's just... let's just walk this way. [starts to cross the street, Stan and Kenny follow him, but they all see more gingers crawl out of the bushes across the street] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49795,Kyle,"Yeah, good idea. [the boys go back the way the came. Gingers converge upon them, and they begin to run] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49798,Kyle,Kenny! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49819,Kyle,"In there! Let's go! [he and Stan run into it and close the doors. They run to a long log and lift it up] Get this jamb on the door! [they throw the jamb into place. Redheads try to wrestle the roads open but can't budge it. A window nearby breaks open and gingers start to crawl in through it. More windows break open, then the walls and doors start falling apart as the gingers barge in. Another ginger looks in from the roof and drops down to join the others. They grab Stan and Kyle, who scream one last time] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49822,Kyle,"[wakes up] Huh. Whaaa? [stands up] Where are we? [walks to the cage wall and looks out. The Sunset Room is dark and red from the glow of a lava cauldron. There are cages all over the place, even hanging from the ceiling. The ginger kids stand around the cauldron] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49826,Kyle,"Oh Jesus, I should have known! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49835,Kyle,Cartman! I need to tell you something! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49837,Kyle,Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private! 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49861,Kyle,"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49866,Kyle,"Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49868,Kyle,"How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49871,Kyle,So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49876,Kyle,"Yeah dude, nothing fun is free. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49879,Kyle,"Yeah. See ya. [Stan moves on down the sidewalk and passes a Scientology center. In front are a table with two people seated behind it, waiting for prospects] "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50059,Kyle,"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50061,Kyle,"Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50063,Kyle,"Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50065,Kyle,What secret truth?? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50067,Kyle,I didn't know you were depressed. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50144,Kyle,"Dude, Jambu is the best! [Jambu returns and takes a quick dive towards the bottom of its tank.] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50152,Kyle,Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50154,Kyle,"Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50158,Kyle,I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50160,Kyle,"Jambu? Jambu? [taps the glass wall four times. Jambu dives and floats up facing Kyle] Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50162,Kyle,"[a little scared, looks around] Who said that? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50164,Kyle,No way! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50166,Kyle,[timidly] South Park. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50168,Kyle,What do you wanna talk about? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50170,Kyle,Rocket ships? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50172,Kyle,Why? Aren't you happy here? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50174,Kyle,This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! [the two men in the booth are laughing their asses off] 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50179,Kyle,[running up to the other boys] Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50181,Kyle,"Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50183,Kyle,"I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! [runs back towards Jambu's exhibit, grinning] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50185,Kyle,"Jambu! Jambu, I'm back! [hits the wall four times, and Jambu swims around, stopping in front of Kyle again] How are you feeling? [no reply. A few seconds later...] Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships? [Brian is playing a video game, Mike is reading a book - Mother Trucker.] Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50187,Kyle,"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50189,Kyle,"Goddammit, say something! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50192,Kyle,"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50194,Kyle,Sick? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50201,Kyle,Oh my God... 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50204,Kyle,That's terrible! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50208,Kyle,"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon, "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50210,Kyle,"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50214,Kyle,"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50216,Kyle,Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50218,Kyle,"Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50220,Kyle,Stan? [Stan rises and approaches the easel] 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50225,Kyle,"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50253,Kyle,"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50255,Kyle,"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50257,Kyle,You can? Awesome! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50259,Kyle,[lowers the phone with some disbelief] Twenty... million? [raises the phone to his ear again] Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50261,Kyle,But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50264,Kyle,They want twenty million dollars. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50269,Kyle,"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50300,Kyle,"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50302,Kyle,"Okay ma, thanks! [behind him is Jambu, and the other boys are keeping him moist] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50306,Kyle,"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program? [waits for the answer] How much to take a whale into space? [waits for the answer] Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on. [puts Mr. Sugiyama on hold as he answers another call] Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50308,Kyle,Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50310,Kyle,"Damnit! [hangs up without returning to Mr. Sugiyama] Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home?? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50312,Kyle,Yeah... He must be really sick. [walks up to the whale and strokes him] Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50345,Kyle,"Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50349,Kyle,"Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50357,Kyle,Huh? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50361,Kyle,"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50368,Kyle,"No! Please, we have to go! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50370,Kyle,"But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50375,Kyle,All right!! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50378,Kyle,It belongs with its family! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50385,Kyle,"Tijuana, Mexico! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50387,Kyle,"You're going home, Willzy-x! [the truck drives away, and Brian crawls over to Mike] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50407,Kyle,"Willzy-x, I think we're here. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50412,Kyle,"Come on, guys! [Craig, Clyde, Kenny, Butters, and Cartman show up. Clyde and Kenny jump up and pull the ramp down] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50415,Kyle,"Hang on. [looks around] Hold on a second. [steps down into the water and addresses Willzy-x] I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x. [the whale opens his mouth. Kyle begins to tear up] I'm gonna miss you. [Butters and Clyde tear up and look at each other] Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. [sniffs a bit, then pets the whale.] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50417,Kyle,"Get him in the water! [the boys pull Willzy-x once more, with a mighty pull] Goodbye, Willzy-x! [the whale takes to the water and the ALF cheers a job well done] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50426,Kyle,We did it! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50433,Kyle,"All right. Thanks for your help, dudes. [the boys walk towards Kyle's house, but Kyle stops] Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50436,Kyle,"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50457,Kyle,"[to Stan] Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. [Cartman and Ike join them. Cartman is wearing a WWII-era Japanese flag as a head band] "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50460,Kyle,"He knew he had to take us all home, too, right? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50469,Kyle,Are you sure you're all right? 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50480,Kyle,"Dude, I think you're being followed. [turns around. Cartman then turns around to look] "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50501,Kyle,I think his pants are falling down. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50510,Kyle,"You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50705,Kyle,Going away? For how long? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50731,Kyle,"Draw two card, fatass. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50736,Kyle,Yeah! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50738,Kyle,Chef! I can't believe you're back! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50760,Kyle,"Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50766,Kyle,Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring. 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50772,Kyle,Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! [a distraught Clyde walks by and stops.] 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50774,Kyle,Like what? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50778,Kyle,['Weirdo. [Fosse moves up and gets his lunch the boys follow him in] ']
10,1,The Return of Chef,50782,Kyle,Good. 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50786,Kyle,...Chef?? A-are you ok? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50793,Kyle,This doesn't make any sense! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50807,Kyle,"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50811,Kyle,"[the boys look at each other] Chef, the police are asking questions about you! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50815,Kyle,"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50818,Kyle,"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50820,Kyle,"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50824,Kyle,"All right, come on guys! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50828,Kyle,"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something? "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50835,Kyle,"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. [the members just look around] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50839,Kyle,"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50841,Kyle,...Dude! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50846,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing? "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50848,Kyle,Just what the hell is that thing?! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50850,Kyle,HA! I knew it! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50852,Kyle,The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50860,Kyle,"All right, come on. [they follow the nurse in] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50862,Kyle,"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50877,Kyle,"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50887,Kyle,No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend. 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50903,Kyle,"Come on, Chef! You can do it! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50923,Kyle,...Do you realize how retarded that sounds? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50929,Kyle,We're not going anywhere without Chef. 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50932,Kyle,No! Hey! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50936,Kyle,"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50939,Kyle,"Chef, come on! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50946,Kyle,"Here! [walks up to the fallen William, gets a small ax from him, walks up to Chef and chops the locks open. They escape the Deprivation Room] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50950,Kyle,Get outside! [chef and the boys reach the front doors] 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50959,Kyle,"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef? [Chef's hesitance shoes a dilemma] Chef? "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50963,Kyle,"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that?? "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50973,Kyle,[heartbroken] CHEF! [a huge bear appears] 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50977,Kyle,You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50984,Kyle,"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days. [Elton John is present] Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us. [Stan, Cartman and Kenny look down at their feet] But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile. [they perk up a bit] I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song. [Timmy and Jimmy are sitting together] I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by. [Terrance and Phillip are present, weeping quietly] So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50987,Kyle,"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. [smiles] "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51008,Kyle,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! [a quite-satisfied Gerald stops at the next intersection. Another hybrid car pulls up alongside him] "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51013,Kyle,"[firmly] Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. [Ike's eyes are half-closed and he's getting woozy] "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51015,Kyle,What?! 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51018,Kyle,"[catches up] Dad, can we go home, please? "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51020,Kyle,"But Dad, I want- "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51023,Kyle,"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here? "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51025,Kyle,[his head drops] Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. [Randy reaches his red SUV and notices the citation on his windshield] 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51036,Kyle,"Dad, let's just go! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51047,Kyle,"[walks into the kitchen with Ike] Dad. [his parents turn to face him] Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51049,Kyle,We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... [rolls his eyes] 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51051,Kyle,...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... [rolls his eyes again and cues Ike] 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51053,Kyle,...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51055,Kyle,You do?? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51057,Kyle,"Righ! [grins] Okay, good. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51059,Kyle,What?? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51083,Kyle,My Dad says he can't live here anymore. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51180,Kyle,[hesitant at first] So... what do you do for fun? 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51183,Kyle,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51187,Kyle,"Yeah, fine, Dad. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51189,Kyle,Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51262,Kyle,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51274,Kyle,Hey Stan. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51282,Kyle,NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing! 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51284,Kyle,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do. [silent reactions all around] Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51286,Kyle,Yeah! 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51293,Kyle,"Yeah, I guess so. "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51295,Kyle,"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! [turns and walks away angry] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51309,Kyle,I have no idea! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51342,Kyle,I TiVo every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51345,Kyle,"Okay you guys, check it out. [begins scanning the recorded programming] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51347,Kyle,"Dude, it's a good show. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51360,Kyle,"Hehaha, heh. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51368,Kyle,That's it? That's all they did? 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51372,Kyle,"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51375,Kyle,Uhhh... 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51380,Kyle,"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51383,Kyle,"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51387,Kyle,"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51417,Kyle,Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51419,Kyle,"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real! "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51424,Kyle,Dad? Are you sure this time? 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51426,Kyle,No! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51430,Kyle,Ike? Iiike! [sees him] Ike! [Ike is heading for the ice cream shop] 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51432,Kyle,"Ike! [points left] This way! [a flash of light fills the night, and Kyle shields his eyes from it. A bomb has gone off behind the ice cream shop and the shockwaves spread out, obliterating the row of stores before Ike.] Iiike! [races towards him. Ike is engulfed by the flames, flesh turning to bone] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51434,Kyle,"[sits upright in his bed and is quite awake now. He catches his breath, then leaves his bed to check on Ike. He opens Ike's door and looks in. Ike is sound asleep under his mobile. Kyle lets out a soft sigh of relief] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51437,Kyle,"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51439,Kyle,"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51441,Kyle,"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51443,Kyle,"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51445,Kyle,I got some sound advice... from an old friend. [they smile at each other. Cartman turns and hops onto his Big Wheels] 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51447,Kyle,"Yeah! [dramatic shots of Cartman getting on his Big Wheels, then of Kyle doing the same] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51449,Kyle,I'm set! Let's do this! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51464,Kyle,"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time. "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51466,Kyle,[puzzled] Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51468,Kyle,"[races ahead] Whoa whoa wait a minute! [pulls a hand brake so as to block Cartman, then gets off his Big Wheels] This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever? "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51470,Kyle,But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51472,Kyle,[realizes Cartman's true intent] You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51474,Kyle,What are you talking about?! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51476,Kyle,I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech. 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51478,Kyle,No! [moves to stop Cartman in his tracks] I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51480,Kyle,"[turns around to see] What? [Cartman shoves him to the ground from behind and quickly gets on his Big Wheels, and peels away. Kyle gets up] CARTMAN! [gets on his Big Wheels and gives chase.] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51485,Kyle,Ahhh! 
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51506,Kyle,"[begins losing control] No! [his Big Wheels go left and he can't brake] AAAAH! [he jumps off as he nears the edge of a cliff] AAAAH! [the Big Wheels goes over the edge and starts bouncing down the side of the cliff. At the first bounce, a rear wheel comes off. At the second bounce, Kyle's knapsack flies off. The rest bounces a few more times until it reaches the ground below, upside down. The Big Wheels explode. Kyle rises and looks down at the wreckage. He nurses an injured right shoulder] "
10,3,Cartoon Wars Part I,51508,Kyle,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51533,Kyle,You just want Family Guy off the air... 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51538,Kyle,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51567,Kyle,"What the hell is going on? [everyone there has his or her head buried in sand. Kyle walks among them] Hello? [stops next to someone in a red sweater] Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles. [tugs at the pants. The person waves. Kyle looks around and goes into the diner] Hello?! [a TV in the store is tuned to SNN] "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51574,Kyle,Who? 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51631,Kyle,Thanks a lot for the ride. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51633,Kyle,I'll do everything I can. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51636,Kyle,"[noticing Bart writing, but doesn't see the actual text] Excuse me. [Bart stops writing and approaches Kyle] Do you know which way the network president's office is? "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51638,Kyle,"Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51640,Kyle,"Oh thanks, dude. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51643,Kyle,"[looks around] Hello? This can't be right, I- [Bart whacks him from behind with a skateboard, and he falls forward] Ow! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51674,Kyle,"[calling to Bart] Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this? "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51676,Kyle,Cartman! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51678,Kyle,You fat son of a bitch! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51681,Kyle,"Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51685,Kyle,"Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51687,Kyle,WHAT?! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51701,Kyle,[appears in the shadows] Cartmaaaan!!! [Cartman stops in his tracks] You fucking fatass! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51703,Kyle,That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51705,Kyle,[seething in anger] You are not. Killing. Family Guy! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51707,Kyle,[checks his watch] There's still time to tell the network president you're full of crap!! [runs off] 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51709,Kyle,Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51711,Kyle,Ow. Quit it! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51715,Kyle,Ow. Quit it! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51717,Kyle,"No more timeouts, fatass! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51721,Kyle,"[coughs] Thanks, kid. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51730,Kyle,[runs in and interrupts] Sir! Mister television executive! Stop! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51732,Kyle,Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51736,Kyle,Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51738,Kyle,What manatees??!! [a fist knocks him away and Cartman steps in] 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51740,Kyle,"[quickly rises] No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51742,Kyle,"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech! "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51747,Kyle,Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51749,Kyle,You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence! 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51752,Kyle,"Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51756,Kyle,"Do the right thing, Mr. President. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51758,Kyle,"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51760,Kyle,"If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is. "
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51762,Kyle,[softly] Do the right thing. Show Mohammad. [Cartman still has his gun on the president] Do. The right. Thing. 
10,4,Cartoon Wars Part II,51765,Kyle,Yes! [dances] 
10,6,ManBearPig,52088,Kyle,Dick Cheney? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52094,Kyle,"[softly, to Stan] ManBearPig? [Stan just turns his hands up and shrugs] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52100,Kyle,"Just play the game, fatass! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52105,Kyle,"Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52110,Kyle,We know. [several seconds of silence follow] 
10,6,ManBearPig,52117,Kyle,"Okay, Mr. Marsh. [the boys move towards the car] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52123,Kyle,He's half man and half bearpig. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52125,Kyle,That doesn't make any sense. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52157,Kyle,"Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52160,Kyle,"Yeah, we've got school anyway. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52173,Kyle,What do ManBearPig droppings look like? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52181,Kyle,What? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52189,Kyle,What are you doing?! [bigger chunks of cave fall between Al Gore and the boys] 
10,6,ManBearPig,52199,Kyle,Hello? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52201,Kyle,We're trapped in here! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52203,Kyle,"Hello, help! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52207,Kyle,Forget it! They can't hear us! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52214,Kyle,"A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction. [the boys split up. Kyle climbs along a pile of boulders] Oh man, we're in big trouble here. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52216,Kyle,"You see anything, Kenny?? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52218,Kyle,"Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything?? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52220,Kyle,"Cartman, you okay?? [Cartman snaps out of it] You need help?? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52222,Kyle,It looks like we're completely sealed in. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52225,Kyle,Maybe we should go for it. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52227,Kyle,Why? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52231,Kyle,"No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52233,Kyle,"Aw, dude! [lifts his jacket over his nose.] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52246,Kyle,"They saw us on the tour. [Cartman comes back from the den] Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52248,Kyle,"Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52252,Kyle,C-Cartman? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52254,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52256,Kyle,"Dude, get away from me! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52276,Kyle,"Stan! Stan, wake up! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52278,Kyle,"No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. [moves off, and Stan follows. Stan shines his light on Cartman, who's now overstuffed with the treasure he's been swallowing. Kenny holds the water bottle Cartman was drinking from] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52282,Kyle,"[taps Stan and takes him aside] We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52284,Kyle,Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52288,Kyle,Come on come on! Pull! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52291,Kyle,What the hell is that?? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52300,Kyle,"What the hell is that? [the boys turn quickly to see where the sound is coming from, and the wave of water appears. Cartman coughs again. The water rises towards them.] Oh my God. [the boys back up] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52302,Kyle,"Ruuun! [the boys turn and run from the advancing water, but it overtakes them, sweeping them along] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52313,Kyle,Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52315,Kyle,Yes you can! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52317,Kyle,I need your help! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52331,Kyle,We need to get our friend to a hospital right away! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52335,Kyle,"Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52341,Kyle,You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch! 
10,7,Tsst,52530,Kyle,You're not staying at my house either. 
10,7,Tsst,52612,Kyle,"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool. "
10,7,Tsst,52620,Kyle,"NO, Cartman! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52659,Kyle,"[voice only] We're over here, by the cart. [POV switches to three other characters - a blue knight, a green lady, and an orange knight stand around waiting for the dwarf. The dwarf walks into the group] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52663,Kyle,"[the green lady with big breasts] If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52667,Kyle,"Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. [walks off, and the others follow] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52678,Kyle,"See where I am? It's this way. [Stan joins the group. Kyle's character turns around, realizes its mistake, and jumps back around] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52680,Kyle,"Wow, look at all these people playing right now. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52683,Kyle,Who is this? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52687,Kyle,"It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. [the ganker jabs at Kenny, who immediately dies.] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52689,Kyle,"[in a soft feminine voice, makes a fist and holds it up for emphasis] You bastard! [the ganker stabs Kyle and then Stan, who both drop and die] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52694,Kyle,Who is that guy? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52729,Kyle,"The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52773,Kyle,He's targeting us. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52778,Kyle,"Ike, look out! [the ganker rushes in and stabs him in the back] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52802,Kyle,"We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52806,Kyle,Boars? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52808,Kyle,"Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52819,Kyle,"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52843,Kyle,Me too. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52846,Kyle,"Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52851,Kyle,"Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52862,Kyle,What's the autolocate macro? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52864,Kyle,"Okay, right behind Stan. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52868,Kyle,Casting...there's an 8-second cast time. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52870,Kyle,"No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52872,Kyle,Cast on him again. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52885,Kyle,"Aaaa... [starts generating the spell, but it abruptly goes out] AH! Huh?! [his character grabs her right wrist with her left hand] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52887,Kyle,Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! [pain shoots through his wrist as he continues flexing his wrist and stretching his fingers] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52893,Kyle,I can't. Just leave me behind. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52933,Kyle,"I'm out of mana, I told you. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52950,Kyle,"Attack! [Kenny quickly takes his bow and arrow and fires an arrow into the ganker's chest. Kyle fires an energy ball at the ganker. The energy ball knocks the knife from the ganker's hand and disables him some more. He falls to the ground on all fours, and the dwarf approaches him, ready to smash the ganker's head in with the mallet] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52970,Kyle,Yeah yeah. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52974,Kyle,That was such über pwnage 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52977,Kyle,Oh yeah. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,52988,Kyle,"Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass! "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53012,Kyle,Not yet. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53014,Kyle,Will you shut up about 9/11! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53016,Kyle,Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53018,Kyle,Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53020,Kyle,"Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53026,Kyle,Where did you hear that? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53029,Kyle,"[walks up and stands next to Butters] Butters, you don't really believe that, do you? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53032,Kyle,"Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53036,Kyle,[rolls his eyes] Oh no... 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53045,Kyle,[rolls his eyes] Oh Christ... 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53049,Kyle,Me??! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53052,Kyle,"Hey Tolkien. [Tolkien does not respond, but just watches him walk by. Kyle stops by Butters and Craig] You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? [Butters is suddenly scared] "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53054,Kyle,"All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11! [the other kids move away quickly] God-damnit! "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53057,Kyle,"[stops in front of Sheila, to her left] Terrible. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53059,Kyle,"But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53096,Kyle,[jumps] Aaaah! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53098,Kyle,"I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53100,Kyle,It's not my fault. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53102,Kyle,Really? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53104,Kyle,......Dude. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53114,Kyle,They are? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53116,Kyle,What? No no no. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53120,Kyle,...That's retarded. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53122,Kyle,"[""There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too it doesn't mean it's wrong. ""]"
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53124,Kyle,[reads the labels] Code 234 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53126,Kyle,What is it? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53128,Kyle,Anthrax?! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53130,Kyle,"Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob! [at that moment the house is raided by Chicago cops. The doors and windows fall away as they rush inside. An ambulance and a lot of police cars wait outside as a helicopter hovers overhead. Kyle stands with the jars of anthrax, sure that he's in big trouble] Aw, aw, awww! "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53139,Kyle,"Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53141,Kyle,"Uh, Mr. President, my name is- "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53143,Kyle,[quite surprised] Really? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53153,Kyle,"[in sheer disbelief, cocks his head right] No. Way. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53156,Kyle,"[ever more incredulous, cocks his head left and lower] ...Really?? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53160,Kyle,[cocks his head right and even lower. He's not buying it] ...Really?? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53171,Kyle,It just... doesn't seem right. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53173,Kyle,"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. [a door opens besides them and the 911truth man the President had shot exits a restaurant and goes the other direction] "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53175,Kyle,"Hey! [the 911truth man turns around, then panics as he recognizes the boys] Dude. You're alive? [the man stands there for a few seconds, not knowing what to do, then turns around and runs away, pushing people aside. Kyle gives chase] Come back here! [the man keeps running] "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53180,Kyle,Dude! What the hell is going on?! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53184,Kyle,"Dude, we aren't going to kill you. [just then a gunshot is heard and the 911truth man falls dead... again] "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53187,Kyle,Who the fuck are you?! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53190,Kyle,Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on?? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53193,Kyle,You f-figured this thing all out? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53203,Kyle,Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53206,Kyle,I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53208,Kyle,Well why don't you just tell people the truth?! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53212,Kyle,Stan! What the fuck?! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53214,Kyle,You knew this whole time? Why? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53216,Kyle,[backs away a bit] What?? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53218,Kyle,So you blamed the government?! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53221,Kyle,"So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53223,Kyle,"So then, who was responsible for 9/11? "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53294,Kyle,Huh? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53296,Kyle,What's he doing at his teacher's house? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53299,Kyle,"Hello? [finds the door open and walks in] Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike? [moves further into the house] Uh, hello? Is Ike here? [enters the room the music and some giggling is coming from - it's the bathroom] Hello? [the teacher, in the bathtub, looks at him] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53301,Kyle,"Oh God! [squeezes his eyes shut] I'm sorry. [opens them again] I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother. [Ike pops up out of the water dressed in snorkel gear. Kyle's eyebrows go up] Ike?? [they just look at him] What the hell is going on?? "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53303,Kyle,[turns to look at her] Really?! What's there not to understand?! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53305,Kyle,"He's a little young, don't you think?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53310,Kyle,All right! We're getting the hell out of here! [begins to pull Ike away from the teacher] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53312,Kyle,"Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53314,Kyle,Ike? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53316,Kyle,[turns to the front door] This is nuts. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53318,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? [Ike glares at Kyle] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53320,Kyle,"Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53322,Kyle,"Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53325,Kyle,"Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time- "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53328,Kyle,"Would you excuse us for a second? [leaves his chair and takes Ike to the living room. Kyle now addresses Ike] You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! That's not fair, Ike! [Ike replies with a series of snippets from nursery rhymes, which has nothing to do with Kyle's concern. Kyle is finished, and the two of them return to the table] Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53333,Kyle,"[appears at the breakroom entrance] Ex, excuse me? [the officers look, and he walks in] My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53335,Kyle,"Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53337,Kyle,"Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53339,Kyle,Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. [the officer to his right is taking notes.] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53341,Kyle,"Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53343,Kyle,Yeah. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53345,Kyle,[firmly] Yes. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53348,Kyle,"What?! No, you don't understand- "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53350,Kyle,Yeah. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53352,Kyle,I think so. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53358,Kyle,Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53360,Kyle,[throws his hands up in frustration and leaves] Gargh! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53362,Kyle,"Guys, can I talk to you? "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53364,Kyle,"I need you to keep quiet about this, all right? [Cartman walks up] My little brother and his tea- "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53366,Kyle,"Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53368,Kyle,The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53372,Kyle,It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand. 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53374,Kyle,"[looks long and hard at Cartman] ""stick it inside her and pee"" "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53378,Kyle,"You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break, [Cartman waves Kyle off and walks away] and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! [this stops Cartman and makes his eyes big] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53380,Kyle,They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53382,Kyle,Well they're doing it! 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53416,Kyle,"Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53419,Kyle,"[sensing Ike, turns around in his chair] Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor. [Ike glares at him] Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53421,Kyle,What? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53423,Kyle,I'm dead to you? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53437,Kyle,What? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53461,Kyle,"Ike, are you okay? [sees an emptier room than usual, and the open window.] Ike? [walks up to the window and sees the ladder still in place.] Iiiike! [the teacher and Ike away.] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53475,Kyle,"Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do. "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53477,Kyle,How do you know that? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53479,Kyle,Who's Beth? 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53484,Kyle,"Can we get going now, please?! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53518,Kyle,Oh crap! [some officers round the corner at the far end of the hall] 
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53540,Kyle,"[steps through Cartman and Beth towards Ike] No! Ike, don't do it! "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53542,Kyle,"Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. [Ike looks at Kyle intently] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53544,Kyle,"Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. [Ike thinks it over] "
10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53547,Kyle,Ike! 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53566,Kyle,[glances defiantly at Stan] I am doing it. 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53569,Kyle,[blinking rather quickly] Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls... 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53571,Kyle,"Fine! [hops off the stool and walks past Cartman] Then YOU do it, you're so tough! "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53573,Kyle,[pushes Cartman to the stool] Prove it! 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53575,Kyle,"You're afraid to do it, too. "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53701,Kyle,He's right. It's just a spooky story. 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53703,Kyle,"I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true. "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53711,Kyle,...Smalls. [Smalls materializes] 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53714,Kyle,Holy crap!! 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53772,Kyle,[gets the ticket and goes back to Smalls] See? You can still make it for the end of the party. 
10,12,Go God Go,53854,Kyle,Will you shut up already?! [Mrs. Garrison enters and isn't too happy about her lesson] 
10,12,Go God Go,53874,Kyle,"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient. "
10,12,Go God Go,53880,Kyle,No. 
10,12,Go God Go,53882,Kyle,"You'll die, retard! "
10,12,Go God Go,53885,Kyle,"Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54280,Kyle,Hello? [he gets static until...] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54282,Kyle,Hello? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54284,Kyle,What do you want?! 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54286,Kyle,"I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea! "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54288,Kyle,[with half-closed eyes] ... Uh huh. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54291,Kyle,... I'm hanging up now. 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54293,Kyle,"Suck my balls, fatass. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54295,Kyle,"Aw Goddammit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! [hangs up] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54478,Kyle,"You got it, Stan! "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54587,Kyle,"Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54590,Kyle,"All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54674,Kyle,"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live? "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54679,Kyle,I don't know. 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54842,Kyle,"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54877,Kyle,I have no idea. 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54879,Kyle,I don't get it either. 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54881,Kyle,...Huh? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54888,Kyle,Is this all you brought us here to see? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54890,Kyle,Butters is staying over tonight? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54897,Kyle,"[stops] Wait, wai- I can't let this happen. [turns around] Butters. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54899,Kyle,Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54902,Kyle,"I mean, that if- "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54905,Kyle,[angered] Hrrugh! [leaves] 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54914,Kyle,Dude! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54918,Kyle,"No dude, that makes you gay! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54920,Kyle,"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54922,Kyle,Yeah huh! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54928,Kyle,Doesn't matter. You're gay now. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54931,Kyle,"No-no wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54933,Kyle,The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54935,Kyle,Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54937,Kyle,[beat] ...Idiot. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54986,Kyle,"What are you talking about, fatass? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54988,Kyle,"You figured that out, huh? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54990,Kyle,Except for us. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54992,Kyle,And all the people we tell. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54996,Kyle,Like what? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55000,Kyle,"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55002,Kyle,"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55021,Kyle,"Okay, my turn. [Kenny gives him the ball and Kyle prepares to shoot. Cartman approaches the park behind him] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55023,Kyle,[throws up the ball] Where's what? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55025,Kyle,Let go of me. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55028,Kyle,Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55030,Kyle,I don't have it. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55032,Kyle,Shut up. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55144,Kyle,"Ow! Quit it, dude! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55147,Kyle,[to Stan] He isn't actually going to show everyone... 
11,3,Lice Capades,55297,Kyle,You know what? I'll bet it was you! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55299,Kyle,This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55303,Kyle,"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55307,Kyle,It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all. 
11,3,Lice Capades,55310,Kyle,It was him. It had to have been him! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55332,Kyle,"What's this about, Cartman? [the boys are now seated on a bench against a wall] "
11,3,Lice Capades,55335,Kyle,"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55337,Kyle,You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55339,Kyle,Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55344,Kyle,"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55349,Kyle,It doesn't prove anything! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55355,Kyle,No way. 
11,3,Lice Capades,55412,Kyle,"Wait... stop it, stop it! [he walks away; the others stop and look at him] I can't let Kenny be sock-dried. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55414,Kyle,"[looks over his left shoulder] Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?! [looks away] It was me. "
11,3,Lice Capades,55416,Kyle,"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it. "
11,4,The Snuke,55449,Kyle,[sniffs - he has a stuffy nose] Yeah? 
11,4,The Snuke,55451,Kyle,"What? No, I'm sick. [sniffs] "
11,4,The Snuke,55453,Kyle,"Dude, leave me alone. "
11,4,The Snuke,55455,Kyle,[sits right up] What? Why? 
11,4,The Snuke,55457,Kyle,"All right, all right. [leaves his bed and goes to his computer, sits down and starts clicking] "
11,4,The Snuke,55459,Kyle,"[types a search term at MySpace] Baahir Hakeem. [Baahir's page pops up] Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about? "
11,4,The Snuke,55461,Kyle,Over a hundred. 
11,4,The Snuke,55463,Kyle,White Stripes 
11,4,The Snuke,55465,Kyle,What? 
11,4,The Snuke,55486,Kyle,Dude. [sniffs and calls Cartman. The LED readout vanishes] 
11,4,The Snuke,55488,Kyle,"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school. "
11,4,The Snuke,55490,Kyle,I guess so. 
11,4,The Snuke,55492,Kyle,Wuh what doesn't follow? 
11,4,The Snuke,55494,Kyle,Okay. 
11,4,The Snuke,55496,Kyle,"[looks up the info as Cartman talks] Yeah. Actually, there is. "
11,4,The Snuke,55498,Kyle,There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally. [Cartman stays silent] Cartman? ...Cartman? [Cartman has turned off his phone and runs out of school] 
11,4,The Snuke,55539,Kyle,So then maybe you're wrong. 
11,4,The Snuke,55541,Kyle,Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street. 
11,4,The Snuke,55543,Kyle,"Yeah. [Cartman giggles and sticks the phone down his pants, in front of his genitals. He takes the picture and sends it to Kyle. Kyle receives it on his computer] What is that? "
11,4,The Snuke,55545,Kyle,God damn it Cartman! 
11,4,The Snuke,55602,Kyle,"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos. "
11,4,The Snuke,55604,Kyle,"Yeah, this guy. [a YouTube profile page is shown] Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally. "
11,4,The Snuke,55606,Kyle,"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally? "
11,4,The Snuke,55608,Kyle,Oh that's a good idea. [does the search] 
11,4,The Snuke,55640,Kyle,"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay. "
11,4,The Snuke,55643,Kyle,Hey. 
11,4,The Snuke,55645,Kyle,[stands up] What's going on? 
11,4,The Snuke,55647,Kyle,...Homeland Security? 
11,4,The Snuke,55679,Kyle,Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it! 
11,4,The Snuke,55681,Kyle,Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing. 
11,4,The Snuke,55688,Kyle,"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest. "
11,4,The Snuke,55690,Kyle,[he and Stan look at each other] ...Not anymore you're not. 
11,4,The Snuke,55748,Kyle,"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British. "
11,4,The Snuke,55752,Kyle,All right! MapQuest the address! 
11,4,The Snuke,55754,Kyle,Good thinking 
11,4,The Snuke,55781,Kyle,"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us. "
11,4,The Snuke,55785,Kyle,"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims! "
11,4,The Snuke,55787,Kyle,...Maybe. [looks away] 
11,4,The Snuke,55789,Kyle,...That is so missing the point. 
11,4,The Snuke,55791,Kyle,"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I- "
11,4,The Snuke,55793,Kyle,No! ...Not... not like you're saying. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55902,Kyle,What happened? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55904,Kyle,...I'm kind of finger painting right now. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55906,Kyle,"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea. "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55914,Kyle,"Hi, we'd like to speak to a [reads the name from a slip of paper] Professor Teabag? [Stan is still carrying Snowball] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55916,Kyle,The history of Easter. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55926,Kyle,It kind of looks like... an egg. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55928,Kyle,Who is Saint Peter? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55931,Kyle,[flatly] Peter Rabbit. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55933,Kyle,I don't see it. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55937,Kyle,I don't believe it. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55941,Kyle,So... the Vatican took Stan's dad? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55964,Kyle,So what now? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55966,Kyle,You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55968,Kyle,I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55992,Kyle,"You swore on the cross, fatso! "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56026,Kyle,Don't you have any superpowers? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56028,Kyle,What? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56030,Kyle,N-no way! Do it yourself. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56032,Kyle,"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus. "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56034,Kyle,[looks at the dagger in dismay] Don't make me do this. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56036,Kyle,Eric Cartman can never know about this. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56038,Kyle,"Happy Easter, Jesus. [stabs Jesus in the neck, as ordered] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56040,Kyle,...Jesus? 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56063,Kyle,"Oh God, here we go again. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56076,Kyle,Our whole weekend is shot. 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56141,Kyle,They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes! 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56144,Kyle,What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us. 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56148,Kyle,"He catches the feesh so, then he can make money. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56157,Kyle,You said you all wrote essays. 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56162,Kyle,"Dude, we're totally fucked now! "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56165,Kyle,"This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail! "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56167,Kyle,Son of a bitch! [the boys turn and head for school] 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56171,Kyle,"Jimmy, did you finish your book report? "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56174,Kyle,We're dead. 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56178,Kyle,"[looks at Cartman, then at Stan. Stan looks back at both of them] Really? "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56345,Kyle,Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. [both boys resume taking notes.] 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56348,Kyle,Fine. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56352,Kyle,"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go. [a slow pan of the homeless around them] They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56356,Kyle,Really? 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56363,Kyle,"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56369,Kyle,"God damn it, that wasn't my idea! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56385,Kyle,"Hi. I've uh... [the man faces him] I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this. [hands him a bill] It's twenty dollars. [drops it into the tin can and backs up, smiling] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56387,Kyle,"[frowns] No, that... I thought that was a lot. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56389,Kyle,[sad at the lack of gratitude] You're welcome. [walks back into the house with his head down] 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56391,Kyle,"Oh crap. [the doorbell rings and Kyle comes down to answer it. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman enter] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56393,Kyle,I don't know. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56398,Kyle,He did? 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56400,Kyle,"Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56402,Kyle,"Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56405,Kyle,"I don't want you to jump them, retard! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56436,Kyle,Oh my God. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56456,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! [behind him, the other three boys move a manhole cover off to one side, opening up a new means of escape] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56486,Kyle,"Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56488,Kyle,"You barely made it over one, fatass! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56490,Kyle,God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a- 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56519,Kyle,What's it doing? 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56525,Kyle,[helps Cartman up] What about you? 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56568,Kyle,We're nine. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56572,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56577,Kyle,"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56582,Kyle,"You son of a bitch. [gets off the bench and approaches the first man with the pamphlet] You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! [opens the pamphlet to show him] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56585,Kyle,I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56600,Kyle,"[turns around] No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56602,Kyle,That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56604,Kyle,We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other! 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56616,Kyle,"All right, hit it. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56625,Kyle, City of Brentwood They take really good care of all their homeless   
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56697,Kyle,"Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. [she walks up to them] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56700,Kyle,"Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56702,Kyle,What? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56706,Kyle,"[after some thought, points and says] He's faking. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56708,Kyle,"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56710,Kyle,Who cares about saying whatever you-? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56712,Kyle,"Grrhh, whatever. [walks off in a huff. Mr. Mackey walks by] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56724,Kyle,[Loses his temper via short temper and yells] Will you knock it off already?! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56726,Kyle,"Don't push me, asshole! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56733,Kyle,"[walks into the office, with Cartman following] No! Up yours, fatboy! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56735,Kyle,"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56737,Kyle,"[his certainty gone] N-no, I'm just saying that I think- "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56750,Kyle,"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56756,Kyle,Dude... 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56758,Kyle,"Aw, come on! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56760,Kyle,"Ah, I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... [the others stare at him] No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56766,Kyle,[grudgingly] I'm sorry. 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56768,Kyle,"[grudgingly, louder] I'm sorry. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56770,Kyle,"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- [stops himself] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56793,Kyle,What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?! 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56795,Kyle,"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56797,Kyle,...Scotch? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56799,Kyle,"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56801,Kyle,"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! [Cartman looks at his drink] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56803,Kyle,What did you say? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56805,Kyle,You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! [runs out of the room and slams the door] 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56859,Kyle,"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position? "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56861,Kyle,You sure you don't wanna back out? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56863,Kyle,"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"". [a light brown car pulls in] The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. [the car stops and Thomas looks around] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56879,Kyle,"Surprise, fatass! "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56881,Kyle,"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly! [car horns blare outside, and Kyle goes to take a look. The parking lot quickly fills up as drivers park and leave their cars.] Whoa. "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56905,Kyle,"[feeling triumphant] Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! [Cartman is silent for a moment, then hugs Kyle and sobs. Kyle wasn't expecting this] "
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56907,Kyle,What? 
11,8,Le Petit Tourette,56909,Kyle,"No, I- I beat you! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57160,Kyle,"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57164,Kyle,"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57168,Kyle,This is fucking retarded! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57170,Kyle,"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57175,Kyle,"Okay, that's enough. [hops off the tree and walks forward] Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57177,Kyle,"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57197,Kyle,"Dad, where do leprechauns come from? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57199,Kyle,So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57201,Kyle,I thought I did. [the doorbell rings and Sheila rises to get the door] 
11,10,Imaginationland,57205,Kyle,"[gets off his seat and stands between Cartman and the table] Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57207,Kyle,"I'm not doing it, fatass! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57210,Kyle,Just get out of here! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57212,Kyle,I don't care if I signed an agreement! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57216,Kyle,"That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57220,Kyle,Hey dudes. [the boys stop and pay attention] 
11,10,Imaginationland,57222,Kyle,How was what? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57224,Kyle,"I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57226,Kyle,"Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57230,Kyle,All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57234,Kyle,Dude. 
11,10,Imaginationland,57242,Kyle,[at his limit] Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57259,Kyle,"[above all the noise] Stan, we have to get out of here!! [Jimmy is with him. The three take off. The terrorist appears behind them, but doesn't see them. Kenny joins the group as a dragon drops down from the sky.] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57264,Kyle,Dude! [the terrorists keep kicking Butters around] 
11,10,Imaginationland,57268,Kyle,"A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. [gets out of bed and walks off] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57271,Kyle,"Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night. "
11,10,Imaginationland,57273,Kyle,"[speechless, then] ...And then it got attacked by terrorists? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57275,Kyle,"Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind! "
11,10,Imaginationland,57279,Kyle,What did they say?? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57281,Kyle,[hearing the crying] ...Dude... 
11,10,Imaginationland,57296,Kyle,I... 
11,10,Imaginationland,57298,Kyle,"Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57353,Kyle,Let's just get this over with! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57355,Kyle,God damnit! 
11,10,Imaginationland,57359,Kyle,Who are you? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57382,Kyle,[above all the noise] We have to get out of here!! 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57408,Kyle,We just... went on a balloon ride. 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57413,Kyle,...What? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57422,Kyle,Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57442,Kyle,Ah I guess. 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57444,Kyle,"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57454,Kyle,"No, no dude, it went up there. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57456,Kyle, Imagina-eh   
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57496,Kyle,"Right, then it was  ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on""   [the lights dim and the portal begins to glow. The boys are confused for a moment, then face the portal with the other people present] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57531,Kyle,Cartman?? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57538,Kyle,I didn't think there was going to be a goddamned leperachaun!!! 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57540,Kyle,"[stunned] Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57542,Kyle,"[looks at General Deckter, than at Stan] Stan? "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57547,Kyle,"I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57549,Kyle,"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to- "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57551,Kyle,"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57553,Kyle,"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! [pounds the table with his left fist] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57555,Kyle,Just get to it already! 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57582,Kyle,"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with! "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57584,Kyle,Let's just do it!! [pounds the table with both fists] 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57617,Kyle,"AAAHHH! [runs away, but ManBearPig scoops him up] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57619,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAA- [ManBearPig lets go of Kyle as the tractor beam fiinally pulls it in. Kyle lays on the floor, blue in the face. Kyle has died...] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57677,Kyle,Stan? [sits up and looks around] 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57679,Kyle,Stan? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57681,Kyle,"Cartman, what's happened? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57683,Kyle,"No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57685,Kyle,Arh! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57687,Kyle,"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57689,Kyle,"Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57713,Kyle,"Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57736,Kyle,Oh for the love of God! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57738,Kyle,"Stan! Dude, is that you? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57740,Kyle,"No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57742,Kyle,"Dude, what's happening? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57758,Kyle,Oh no. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57763,Kyle,The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57765,Kyle,What am I supposed to do? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57767,Kyle,Stan? Stan?? [gets out of bed and puts on his clothes] 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57769,Kyle,I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57771,Kyle,"No, I don't! The decision was overturned. [walks out of the room] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57773,Kyle,"[walking towards the entrance] Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57789,Kyle,"Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57792,Kyle,"Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57852,Kyle,Nothing. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57854,Kyle,[stands up and moves around] Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! [a man walking by looks at him for a few seconds] 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57856,Kyle,They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57858,Kyle,"No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57860,Kyle,Huh? [POV changes. The White House is seen in the distance] 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57862,Kyle,Oh boy... 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57864,Kyle,"Jesus, I can't do anything. [a man walking down the steps stops to look, then continues walking.] I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government. [Jesus falls silent] Uh, hello? Jesus? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57866,Kyle,[dejected] Aah. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57868,Kyle,"Yeah, I guess. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57871,Kyle,Hi Superman. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57873,Kyle,[subdued] I know. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57875,Kyle,Oh God... 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57896,Kyle,"Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57898,Kyle,You have to stop! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57900,Kyle,"Because I- [catches himself] I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. [Cartman begins a slow clap, then speeds it up. The techs in the room join in and soon everyone is applauding Kyle's speech] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57903,Kyle,"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls, [forces Cartman to face him] you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am [jab] never going to suck your balls, [jab] never!! So [jab] there!!! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57923,Kyle,"Cartman, don't! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57928,Kyle,"[""I'm not sucking your balls that's imaginary! ""]"
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57933,Kyle,I am not sucking Cartman's balls! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57960,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57978,Kyle,"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. [the points pile up and they near 100,000. After a final flourish, their readouts combine into one, showing 100,000 points. The boys congratulate Stan and Kyle] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57990,Kyle,For reals? [smiles] 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58006,Kyle,"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. [Jabs is shown with a white tiger on his lap and two women around him] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58009,Kyle,Oh my God! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58018,Kyle,Do we? He's a legend! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58021,Kyle,"[takes Stan aside] Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58026,Kyle,"D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58029,Kyle,"Oh, okay. Cool. [takes off his controller and follows Jim out] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58050,Kyle,"[enters the house] Hey dude, how's it-? [he has his new controller, but he's dismayed at what he sees. The boys look at him and the game is shut off] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58053,Kyle,[walks up to Stan] Who is this? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58056,Kyle,"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58058,Kyle,But it's our game. We bought it together. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58060,Kyle,Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58064,Kyle,I have been sick! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58066,Kyle,"[stunned for a few seconds] I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. [drops his controller next to Stan and walks out of the house, closing the door behind him] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58109,Kyle,I'm not done yet. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58111,Kyle,No. You're thinking of somebody else. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58114,Kyle,"Look, just go ahead and play, alright? [gets off the stool and walks away] Leave me alone. [walks up to the bar and takes a seat] Can I get a Fresca, please? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58116,Kyle,"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58118,Kyle,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58120,Kyle,"Thanks, Mick. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58157,Kyle,"What are you doing here? [""I paint a picture of the days gone by,""] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58159,Kyle,"Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. [""When love went blind and you would make me see."" Kyle walks over to the bar and serves himself some Fresca] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58161,Kyle,"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! [""So that I knew you were there for me""] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58163,Kyle,"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! [""Time after time you were there for me""] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58165,Kyle,"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! [""Love letters in the sand - I remember you...""] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58167,Kyle,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58169,Kyle,"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58171,Kyle,I don't really see the fun in... [turns around with fire in his eyes] ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58173,Kyle,"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58175,Kyle,"[stops abruptly] Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here. [turns around and face Mick] Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58177,Kyle,"Thanks, Mick! [turns left and walks out. Stan follows him.] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58204,Kyle,"Goddamnit... Goddamnit. [walks away pissed off. Stan takes off his controller and looks at it, drops it to the floor, and follows after Kyle] "
11,14,The List,58218,Kyle,"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time. "
11,14,The List,58227,Kyle,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! [the boys look at each other for a few seconds] "
11,14,The List,58271,Kyle,"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Tolkien and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and... [finds himself at #16, the last one on the list. His head drops a little] Me? "
11,14,The List,58273,Kyle,No way. 
11,14,The List,58277,Kyle,I'm last? Last? 
11,14,The List,58279,Kyle,I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class? 
11,14,The List,58289,Kyle,The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy. 
11,14,The List,58291,Kyle,"Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest. "
11,14,The List,58293,Kyle,Oh God! I do? 
11,14,The List,58295,Kyle,[slaps both hands on his own nose] Ah! 
11,14,The List,58297,Kyle,"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no? [Ike looks at him, then at their parents, then back at him. Kyle takes this to mean yes, and so leaves his chair] You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me! "
11,14,The List,58318,Kyle,"Hello. [the girl takes a sip of her milk, then lowers the carton] "
11,14,The List,58323,Kyle,Yeah. 
11,14,The List,58325,Kyle,"[leans away, then stands up] No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly! "
11,14,The List,58327,Kyle,"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover. "
11,14,The List,58329,Kyle,"[to the girl wearing glasses] Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses. [removes them, and is met with tiny little eyes. The girl smiles after a few seconds] Let's just... put those back on. [puts them back on the girl, goes back to the steps, sits down and buries his head in his arms with a sigh. A few seconds later, Stan walks by and stops. He looks at the group helplessly. A few seconds later, he walks up to the merry-go-round, where Wendy, Lola, and Red are chatting] "
11,14,The List,58367,Kyle,They all laugh at me! [flicks on] And the girls giggle behind my back! [flicks off] unable to even glance at my disfigured face. 
11,14,The List,58369,Kyle,Who said that? 
11,14,The List,58371,Kyle,Abraham Lincoln? 
11,14,The List,58375,Kyle,But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now. 
11,14,The List,58377,Kyle,Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home! 
11,14,The List,58381,Kyle,I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore! 
11,14,The List,58396,Kyle,[determined] That should just about do it. 
11,14,The List,58426,Kyle,"[on the school roof pouring lighter fluid out] All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this! "
11,14,The List,58428,Kyle,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity! "
11,14,The List,58430,Kyle,Huh?? 
11,14,The List,58433,Kyle,"Stan, what is going on?! "
11,14,The List,58436,Kyle,So what number was I?? 
11,14,The List,58446,Kyle,She's gonna kill us? 
11,14,The List,58459,Kyle,I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58510,Kyle,Cartman has HIV? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58512,Kyle,Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58515,Kyle,...No. Way. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58518,Kyle,"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. [Leaves the room and begins laughing in the hallway. It can be heard from in the room.] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58551,Kyle,"[trying to stop laughing long enough to say something] I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58553,Kyle,I do. [smiles and keeps from laughing] 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58555,Kyle,"I'm sorry. I gotta go home. [laughs, turns away and leaves. His laughter trails off] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58576,Kyle,Wagh. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58584,Kyle,What? No?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58587,Kyle,What? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58592,Kyle,"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe... [his eyes open wide at the realization that Cartman deliberately infected him with the HIV virus.] Oh my God. [gets angry] That son of a bitch!!! [hops off the bed and rushes out the door] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58596,Kyle,"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58599,Kyle,Why do I have HIV?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58602,Kyle,What did you do?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58604,Kyle,"Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! [Behind Cartman, Butters motions Kyle not to say anything further] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58606,Kyle,Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58608,Kyle,"[lunges at Cartman] AAAAAAA! [starts punching him mercilessly, the other kids start cheering and jumping up and down while one girl does not and looks on with concern while titling her head.] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58610,Kyle,[doesn't let up] Hate you! [punch] Hate you! [punch. Mr. Mackey walks into the fray] 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58614,Kyle,[pointing to Cartman] He gave me AIDS! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58616,Kyle,He purposely infected me with his HIV virus! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58624,Kyle,An apology?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58628,Kyle,[can't believe these adults] ...What?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58630,Kyle,A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58634,Kyle,"[turns around and returns to Cartman, then says between gritted teeth calmly but angrily] I am going to break everything that you own. [spins around and walks away] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58638,Kyle,"There is no cure, you asshole! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58640,Kyle,What hope?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58642,Kyle,You're lying! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58644,Kyle,Magic Johnson? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58646,Kyle,So what?! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58648,Kyle,"[looks at the XBOX for a few moments, then] You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58656,Kyle,"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58658,Kyle,NO! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58670,Kyle,[coldly] Don't. Touch me. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58675,Kyle,"[moments later] Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58678,Kyle,['[quickly irritated via short temper exploding] Will you stop it with that!?! [angrily points at Cartman] What part of this is funny to you?!! ']
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58680,Kyle,What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58682,Kyle,"[angrily points at Cartman again] Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV positive!! [Cartman keeps quiet] This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, [points at Cartman a third time with his eyes closed.] So shut the fuck up!! "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58684,Kyle,[angrily points at Cartman a fourth time] Knock it off!! Right now!! This isn't funny!! At all!! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58686,Kyle,[quickly] Yes!!! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58689,Kyle,Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58693,Kyle,But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58697,Kyle,Dude. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58699,Kyle,You sleep with money. Every night? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58706,Kyle,"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe... "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58712,Kyle,[looks away] Wugh. 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58729,Kyle,Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS! 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58734,Kyle,I'm still breaking your Xbox. [turns right and walks off] 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58761,Kyle,A hundred thousand dollars? 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58765,Kyle,[gets off the sofa] Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney. 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58767,Kyle,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58773,Kyle,A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58777,Kyle,"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58782,Kyle,"[stammers] We uh, we have special permission? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58790,Kyle,We did it guys! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58793,Kyle,Ahall right! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58795,Kyle,"All right. Butters, go get next to her. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58800,Kyle,"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58812,Kyle,How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard. 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58814,Kyle,Whew. 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58817,Kyle,"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58823,Kyle,Oh my God! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58826,Kyle,"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. [Britney gargles something back. The boys join the doctor at her side] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58829,Kyle,"Oh, God, what have we done?! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58836,Kyle,"[he and Stan are blinded by the flash] Dude! [the doctor reaches the curtains and closes them, but the flashes don't stop going off] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58849,Kyle,"Oh crap! [the photographers again clamor for Britney's attention, and one of them asks about her choice of shoes] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58854,Kyle,What?! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58857,Kyle,"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58875,Kyle,"Aw come on now, people! [the manager is pleased with the performance] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58886,Kyle,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58905,Kyle,"Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58909,Kyle,Yes they are! I have an idea. 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58917,Kyle,"[takes off the sunglasses] I'm not Britney Spears, all right?! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58920,Kyle,"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute! [the group turns around. Kyle drops the sunglasses] Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58922,Kyle,[quizzically] Huh? [thunder starts rolling in the distance] 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58933,Kyle,What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58935,Kyle,NO! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58942,Kyle,You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself? 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58945,Kyle,[bewildered] Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58951,Kyle,"Mom, Dad! [runs up to them] They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58953,Kyle,Be a good boy? You know all about this? 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58955,Kyle,"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58959,Kyle,Corn harvest! 
12,3,Major Boobage,58986,Kyle,"You can get high from choking yourself? [Kenny feels for his neck through his hood, then squeezes once he finds it] "
12,3,Major Boobage,58994,Kyle,You guys are wasting your time. 
12,3,Major Boobage,59000,Kyle,Whoa! [Kenny staggers backwards. The other guys gather round him] 
12,3,Major Boobage,59016,Kyle,"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down! "
12,3,Major Boobage,59020,Kyle,"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59023,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59054,Kyle,"Guys, have you seen Kenny? "
12,3,Major Boobage,59056,Kyle,"Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys... [Cartman and Stan turn to listen] I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59060,Kyle,"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59064,Kyle,Kenny? [pounds three more times] 
12,3,Major Boobage,59067,Kyle,Kenny! 
12,3,Major Boobage,59074,Kyle,"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59078,Kyle,"Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! [abruptly, Kenny vomits, stops, then vomits again. Some of it gets on Butters' face and shirt.] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59083,Kyle,[grabs the other cat as it walks up to him] We've gotta keep this away from him. 
12,3,Major Boobage,59091,Kyle,[walks up to them] Yeah? 
12,3,Major Boobage,59093,Kyle,[shrugs] No. 
12,3,Major Boobage,59095,Kyle,"[holds his hands out in denial] All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59098,Kyle,I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life. 
12,3,Major Boobage,59100,Kyle,"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second? "
12,3,Major Boobage,59102,Kyle,God! [goes upstairs] 
12,3,Major Boobage,59125,Kyle,Dad! Somebody's at the front door! [the doorbell rings twice and Kyle goes to his room door] Well am I grounded or not?! [the doorbell rings three times] Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! [leaves his room and opens the front door] 
12,3,Major Boobage,59128,Kyle,[quizzically] What? 
12,3,Major Boobage,59130,Kyle,"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?! "
12,3,Major Boobage,59133,Kyle,"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad? "
12,3,Major Boobage,59147,Kyle,Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?! 
12,3,Major Boobage,59158,Kyle,[eyes closed] I have no idea. 
12,3,Major Boobage,59171,Kyle,[cross] And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history? 
12,3,Major Boobage,59174,Kyle,"Yeah. [Kenny begins to grab more flowers with gusto to get more of their aroma. The other boys get worried] He's getting... really high on life. [Kenny begins to snort and grabs all the flowers he can, treating them just as he did the cats earlier.] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59176,Kyle,"[runs to Kenny] Kenny! [Stan and Cartman follow. Kenny falls in Kyle's arms, goes into spasms, and then freezes, his eyes unfocused] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59178,Kyle,Kenny? Kenny?! 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59229,Kyle,"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59231,Kyle,"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59243,Kyle,There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike! 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59266,Kyle,"Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. [he's calling from his house, with the other boys standing back aways] "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59268,Kyle,We totally think you should have more money. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59270,Kyle,Huh? Well we don't really have that much money. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59272,Kyle,The Internet? 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59276,Kyle,They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59279,Kyle,We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59288,Kyle,"[walks over to the window] Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! [Ike is on his back] "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59334,Kyle,[finds the phone...] Excuse me. [...leaves his seat and exits the waiting room. Then he takes the call] Hello? 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59336,Kyle,Wait we're working on it. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59338,Kyle,"Sir, we're doing everything we can. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59340,Kyle,We don't want you to die. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59343,Kyle,"We have to speed this up! [to Chocolate Rain Guy] Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please? "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59356,Kyle,"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59368,Kyle,"Okay, we did it. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59371,Kyle,Here. [hands Mr. Abootman the money] We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. [Mr. Abootman takes the check and looks at it] 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59374,Kyle,Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59376,Kyle,"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59382,Kyle,"[picks up the phone] Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59384,Kyle,"[Mr. Abootman leans on the door, crying] He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59386,Kyle,"If they give you something small, will you end the strike? "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59388,Kyle,Can you act like you're giving him a lot? 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59397,Kyle,Ike. Ike! [Ike wakes up] It's over. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59399,Kyle,Yeah. Here you go. [hands him a Bennigan's coupon and a gumdrop. Kyle and the others head indoors] 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59402,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59442,Kyle,"You're not the teacher, fatass. "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59470,Kyle,You're not an awesome teacher! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59472,Kyle,The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59474,Kyle,Kenny's! 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59477,Kyle,"Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! [walks away. Stan and Kenny follow. Cartman is scared, then he starts thinking] "
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59517,Kyle,What? 
12,6,Over Logging,59691,Kyle,Ih it's not working. 
12,6,Over Logging,59693,Kyle,I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in. 
12,6,Over Logging,59698,Kyle,I have to get online before school. 
12,6,Over Logging,59713,Kyle,It's not working here? 
12,6,Over Logging,59806,Kyle,Where... is... the Internet? 
12,6,Over Logging,59853,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute. [gets off the couch and walks away to think alone] Is it possible that... "
12,6,Over Logging,59855,Kyle,I think... I know what's wrong. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59917,Kyle,This is gonna suck. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59925,Kyle,"I hate you, remember? [turns away] You wanna be partners, Jimmy? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59944,Kyle,[points to the Smithy] That guy is wearing a digital watch. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59970,Kyle,Right. Except for it really isn't. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59972,Kyle,What's that? 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59985,Kyle,"Come on, this is serious! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60004,Kyle,"[opens the door and leads the others in, then spots the phone] Here! Here's the phone! [Wendy gets on the stool and tries to dial out] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60007,Kyle,What's the number to dial out? 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60014,Kyle,"I got through. Hello, police? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60016,Kyle,There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60018,Kyle,The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60020,Kyle,"[glances back at the two men] Sister, you don't know the half of it. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60058,Kyle,Why aren't the cops coming in? 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60061,Kyle,[annoyed] Will you shut up! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60117,Kyle,I don't believe it. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60160,Kyle,"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60162,Kyle,Stan? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60249,Kyle,"[steps forward, away from the others] I'm sorry. [holds his palms up and out, then shakes them as if to hold off something] I I'm sorry, I can't do this. [then lowers them] I'm not doing this. [walks off to his right] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60251,Kyle,"Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! [walks away. The other boys look at him, Stan a bit shocked] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60255,Kyle,"Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60257,Kyle,"[leaves his desk angrily and faces Stan] Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did [takes his hands, puts them side by side, and sweeps them out away from each other] nothing! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60259,Kyle,[turns around and faces Stan] Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60261,Kyle,"[turns away again] I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again. [clenches his fists at the thought of it, then loosens the grips and turns around] And because we did nothing... they got away. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60263,Kyle,"[wipes something from his forehead] I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. [walks out of the room. Stan watches him leave, then sighs] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60284,Kyle,No... No! [he's having a nightmare] No... 
12,8,The China Probrem,60286,Kyle,"No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60288,Kyle,We can't just leave! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60290,Kyle,Aw it's horrible! [we now join the dream already in progress] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60293,Kyle,Somebody do something! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60296,Kyle,They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're... [blinks hard] they're raping him! [Stan quickly covers his eyes] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60298,Kyle,Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60300,Kyle,WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60308,Kyle,[suddenly wakes up] NOO! [sits on the edge of his bed.] Noo. No. Awwh. [sobs softly in relief] Aw no... 
12,8,The China Probrem,60396,Kyle,"My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60398,Kyle,"I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day. [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60400,Kyle,[gets off the chair] Stan? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60402,Kyle,I love you too. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60406,Kyle,[points at him] Did you see it? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60410,Kyle,Indy deserved more than that! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60443,Kyle,"I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60464,Kyle,It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. [Mitch begins to bawl and that sends the boys to crying] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60489,Kyle,What? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60495,Kyle,We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60754,Kyle,"No, really. We've always thought you suck. "
12,10,Pandemic,60763,Kyle,"I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream? "
12,10,Pandemic,60767,Kyle,Girls like shaved balls? 
12,10,Pandemic,60774,Kyle,I think Kenny likes it. [Kenny's groovin' to the music] 
12,10,Pandemic,60805,Kyle,Two hundred dollars? 
12,10,Pandemic,60808,Kyle,...Become a Peruvian flute band? 
12,10,Pandemic,60813,Kyle,But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? [the boys give it some thought] 
12,10,Pandemic,60823,Kyle,"[enters with Stan and Kenny] Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band! "
12,10,Pandemic,60837,Kyle,Gracias. 
12,10,Pandemic,60839,Kyle,This is awesome! 
12,10,Pandemic,60845,Kyle,God damn it! 
12,10,Pandemic,60877,Kyle,"Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second? "
12,10,Pandemic,60895,Kyle,Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay! 
12,10,Pandemic,60939,Kyle,We just wanna go home. 
12,10,Pandemic,60943,Kyle,"Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States. "
12,10,Pandemic,60962,Kyle,"No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! [almost falls apart, but Stan grabs him and holds him in place] "
12,10,Pandemic,60964,Kyle,"You know I can't go there, Stan! "
12,10,Pandemic,60993,Kyle,That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they? 
12,10,Pandemic,61001,Kyle,This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru? 
12,10,Pandemic,61003,Kyle,"Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61046,Kyle,Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61074,Kyle,And that makes sense to you? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61080,Kyle,So we've gotta find another way out of here. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61123,Kyle,Yeah. Stuff just happens. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61125,Kyle,That's right! 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61148,Kyle,Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61151,Kyle,"Hey, hey, look at this. [points to his right. The other boys look. A small temple is shown with two statues, one on either side of the entrance. The boys approach it] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61153,Kyle,I don't know. It's old. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61159,Kyle,"Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61162,Kyle,"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61165,Kyle,"Oh no way! Look! [a flute band is shown behind bars] The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. [the boys look up and to the right] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61169,Kyle,That is Craig. [Craig comes forward to look for himself. The other boys back away] 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61216,Kyle,Hear that? It sounds like water. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61230,Kyle,How do you do that? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61263,Kyle,Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61282,Kyle,"Yeah, what a dick! "
12,12,About Last Night...,61328,Kyle,"Dude, have you seen my parents? [Ike begins to cry] "
12,12,About Last Night...,61330,Kyle,"He was a McCain supporter. [Ike cries harder] It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61400,Kyle,"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61402,Kyle,What?! 
12,12,About Last Night...,61404,Kyle,Oh my God! [drops the phone and follows Stan to Ike] 
12,12,About Last Night...,61406,Kyle,"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for! [Ike begins to cry] I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay. [Ike mumbles something to him] No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan. [Ike says something more] Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something. [The camera zooms out to show that the window is barely off the ground. Ike cries, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61409,Kyle,Ike? [no response] Oh crap Ike? 
12,12,About Last Night...,61451,Kyle,"[looks around] Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. [Randy punches his boss in the face and his boss just leaves, holding his hands over his nose] "
12,12,About Last Night...,61468,Kyle,"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61474,Kyle,"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61480,Kyle,"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter! "
12,12,About Last Night...,61483,Kyle,We NEED a ride to the hospital! 
12,12,About Last Night...,61512,Kyle,"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. [they enter the ER and see a lot of patients in there. One man has an Obama flag stuck up his ass. The clock reads 9 p.m., so it must be broken] "
12,12,About Last Night...,61514,Kyle,"[getting the nurse's attention] E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61518,Kyle,"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61539,Kyle,"What the hell? [they observe the burning plane. Ike sneaks away while the boys are distracted. He dashes across the hall to the coroner's office and enters it. He hops onto a chair and attaches a USB stick to a computer, and begins typing. Dossiers of the heist team members pop up and Ike classifies each one as deceased. The door opens, and Kyle and Stan enter] Ike? "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61566,Kyle,What's High School Musical 3? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61599,Kyle,Are we the only ones here who are completely confused? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61606,Kyle,They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61609,Kyle,I'm not doing it either. Kenny? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61612,Kyle,I swear 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61617,Kyle,What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61624,Kyle,Aw man. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61713,Kyle,"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61764,Kyle,What? Are you crazy? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61766,Kyle,"We promised each other we would never do that, remember? "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61774,Kyle,"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61819,Kyle,"Well, I had to see it to believe it! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61822,Kyle,We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you! 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61825,Kyle,You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals! 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61845,Kyle," Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. [Cartman dances over to two kids]   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61850,Kyle," Do what you want, don't have restraint.   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61858,Kyle,Where did everybody go? 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61867,Kyle,"Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? [looks like all the other kids are playing the same game: Call of Duty: World at War] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61880,Kyle,"Butters, there's no such thing as vampires. "
13,1,The Ring,62120,Kyle,"Yeah, it's just so astounding. "
13,1,The Ring,62123,Kyle,This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now. 
13,1,The Ring,62131,Kyle,"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever. "
13,1,The Ring,62135,Kyle,What?! 
13,1,The Ring,62148,Kyle,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but... "
13,1,The Ring,62150,Kyle,"W-well, we've heard that she's... "
13,1,The Ring,62170,Kyle,Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel? 
13,1,The Ring,62173,Kyle,You want Tammy to give you a B.J.? 
13,1,The Ring,62178,Kyle,What kind of protection? 
13,1,The Ring,62185,Kyle,"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this? "
13,1,The Ring,62258,Kyle,What's that? 
13,1,The Ring,62262,Kyle,"...Well, what does that mean? "
13,1,The Ring,62266,Kyle,"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting B.J.s anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex. "
13,1,The Ring,62270,Kyle,"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now. "
13,1,The Ring,62317,Kyle,"Yup, he's in here. [Stan and Cartman appear behind him, then they all exit frame, reappearing at the video section.] "
13,1,The Ring,62319,Kyle,"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?! "
13,1,The Ring,62327,Kyle,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd. "
13,1,The Ring,62331,Kyle,"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert! "
13,1,The Ring,62333,Kyle,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. [runs off to catch up with the other two boys. Kenny is left caressing the DVD] "
13,1,The Ring,62359,Kyle,What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?! 
13,1,The Ring,62362,Kyle,Cartman? 
13,1,The Ring,62365,Kyle,D'ow... [they both fall over unconscious.] 
13,1,The Ring,62388,Kyle,We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him. 
13,1,The Ring,62417,Kyle,"Well, now we know. "
13,2,The Coon,62463,Kyle,"...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway. "
13,2,The Coon,62465,Kyle,"...Dude, what?! "
13,2,The Coon,62467,Kyle,Why do you care? 
13,2,The Coon,62580,Kyle,"[looks, then jumps in his seat] Whoa, what the? "
13,2,The Coon,62582,Kyle,"Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid. "
13,2,The Coon,62584,Kyle,"Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are. "
13,2,The Coon,62586,Kyle,Who? Me? Why? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62734,Kyle,Well this sucks! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62737,Kyle,"You want something new every week, fatass. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62739,Kyle,My fault? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62741,Kyle,"[jumps off his rocky perch and faces Cartman] Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62743,Kyle,"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that? "
13,3,Margaritaville,62746,Kyle,"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it. [the other boys now pay attention to Kyle. Two men watch Kyle from afar.] What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go out and shop. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62774,Kyle,"What's that? [a crowd of men runs past them, snatching up squirrels on the way] "
13,3,Margaritaville,62776,Kyle,What? [the boys stand and follow the men] 
13,3,Margaritaville,62780,Kyle,What's going on? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62782,Kyle,What did he do? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62785,Kyle,"[steps in between Garrison and the crowd] Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62787,Kyle,"Come on, this is ridiculous! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62789,Kyle,"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. [a man behind Principal Victoria moves and hucks a squirrel at Garrison] "
13,3,Margaritaville,62804,Kyle,"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them. [pulls out an envelope] I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card. [from Kyle's position, one can see hundreds of people listening to him] It has no spending limit. [cries of shock rise from the crowd] Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62827,Kyle,I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this. 
13,3,Margaritaville,62829,Kyle,"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. [the other boys gasp and look at Kyle. Tweek and Ike look at Clyde] "
13,3,Margaritaville,62831,Kyle,"[looks at Cartman for a few seconds, then enunciates] Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62833,Kyle,"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. [looks down at his plate] "
13,3,Margaritaville,62860,Kyle,"It's okay, Ma. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62863,Kyle,"[pays it off, with difficulty.] Heunh. [Randy smiles and walks away] "
13,3,Margaritaville,62871,Kyle,"[on the sofa watching the TV] Aww, come on! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62885,Kyle,"Come on guys, we gotta go! [leads the boys down the hall] "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62946,Kyle,It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62959,Kyle,Robbed us of our innocence. 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63064,Kyle,Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63232,Kyle,"We know, Cartman! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63238,Kyle,"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63240,Kyle,"Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63242,Kyle,"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63245,Kyle,What? 
13,5,Fishsticks,63247,Kyle,"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit! "
13,5,Fishsticks,63249,Kyle,"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"" "
13,5,Fishsticks,63302,Kyle,"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63304,Kyle,"You know what, Cartman? I believe you. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63306,Kyle,"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! [turns and leaves the bathroom] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63668,Kyle,"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63670,Kyle,"No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63672,Kyle,"Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63674,Kyle,"Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know... "
13,7,Fatbeard,63677,Kyle,[puts his hands together and prays] Please. Please let him go. 
13,7,Fatbeard,63767,Kyle,"Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Tolkien? He's not just staying at their houses? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63769,Kyle,Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63771,Kyle,"[chuckles] Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63774,Kyle,I'll call you back. [hangs up. Sheila approaches him.] 
13,7,Fatbeard,63776,Kyle,What? Are you sure? 
13,7,Fatbeard,63778,Kyle,"[takes the note and reads it aloud] ""Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63781,Kyle,Oh God. What have I done? 
13,7,Fatbeard,63859,Kyle,"No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63861,Kyle,I know! I was lying then! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63863,Kyle,"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive! [a fish walks out of the water on hind legs, squawks, turn around and goes back into the ocean] Cartman, just give me my brother [Cartman turns around and faces Kyle] and let us get out of here! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63885,Kyle,"Cartman, knock it off! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63895,Kyle,They never grow old because they die before they're 30! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63921,Kyle,"[comes out of his room] Ike! Ike, what?! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63936,Kyle,"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63939,Kyle,"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63941,Kyle,What? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63953,Kyle,What?! Are you serious?! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63955,Kyle,"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63957,Kyle,"NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63974,Kyle,What was what? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63991,Kyle,Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63993,Kyle,"It's all just in your head, Ike. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63997,Kyle,I just... don't understand it. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63999,Kyle,"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it? "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64001,Kyle,"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear. [to Stan] Do you understand this? "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64008,Kyle,Purgatory? What's that? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64030,Kyle,What? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64032,Kyle,"Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64034,Kyle,"Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64042,Kyle,"Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please! [Ike's eyes slowly open] Eh there you go. That's good. [Ike looks around] Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64044,Kyle,Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64047,Kyle,Come back here! [the boys give chase] 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64049,Kyle,Hey! Heeey! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64053,Kyle,"Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64056,Kyle,What the hell are we going to do?? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64072,Kyle,"[still trying to make sense of Cartman's ...problem] Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me: [puts both his hands on the table and spreads his fingers out] the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed? "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64074,Kyle,So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64076,Kyle,Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64078,Kyle,"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more? "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64081,Kyle,What has Michael Jackson always tried to be? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64085,Kyle,"Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? [Kyle looks at his friends, then down at the floor. His friends look at each other. Yes, Kyle...] "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64094,Kyle,"Alright, Michael! [Kenny mumbles something] "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64123,Kyle,Aww crap! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64127,Kyle,We're totally screwed! [Brandy and her mom walk by. Brandy's actually a redhead] They took the two best judges away! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64130,Kyle,"Aw dude, this is hopeless! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64133,Kyle,[not making the connection] So what?! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64143,Kyle,Yeah! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64149,Kyle,"Ike! [runs up to him. The other boys follow] Ike, you're back! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64151,Kyle,"It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64174,Kyle,So what? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64185,Kyle,"Butters, I think you should reconsider this. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64187,Kyle,"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64251,Kyle,Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64259,Kyle,"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! [slams his locker door shut and walks off with the other three boys] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64348,Kyle,"Butters, I really think we should talk. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64350,Kyle,"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64352,Kyle,"Butters, what's happened to you? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64455,Kyle,Wrestling is awesome! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64460,Kyle,"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64462,Kyle,"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64465,Kyle,Cool! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64486,Kyle,Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64520,Kyle,"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64533,Kyle,"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64549,Kyle,"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64551,Kyle,"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64559,Kyle,"Irene, no! Why? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64581,Kyle,Good thing we made those changes to the seating. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64584,Kyle,Let's do this! One! Two! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64602,Kyle,So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64605,Kyle,What dude? [the other boys gather 'round] 
13,10,W.T.F.,64611,Kyle,"This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. [Stan and Kyle begin chanting ""Omigod!"" repeatedly] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64613,Kyle,Oh my God... Oh my God... 
13,10,W.T.F.,64616,Kyle,[fans himself] Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64624,Kyle,"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do. [an elderly fan holds up a sign: ""STOP RUNNING JUGGERNAUT""] And I, again, am alone. [Stan, Butters, and Tolkien climb into the ring behind him] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64627,Kyle,"I'll fight anytime, anywhere! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64634,Kyle,"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64641,Kyle,What are you talking about? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64644,Kyle,What? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64648,Kyle,"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64652,Kyle,So what do we do? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64656,Kyle,How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64664,Kyle,That guy's a pretty good wrestler. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64674,Kyle,[standing on a stool by the front window] He's here! Vince McMahon is here! [the other boys arrive. An assistant opens the back door and Vince steps out and surveys the front yard.] 
13,10,W.T.F.,64681,Kyle,You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64683,Kyle,Wait a minute. Who is that? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64685,Kyle,"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64695,Kyle,"There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64747,Kyle,What? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64753,Kyle,Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64800,Kyle,"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64802,Kyle,"What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64982,Kyle,Hello? Stan? 
13,12,The F Word,64996,Kyle,This... is exactly what I needed. 
13,12,The F Word,65047,Kyle,Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass. 
13,12,The F Word,65049,Kyle,"Oh, what the hell?! [the bikers roll by with a variety of musical instruments, a siren, and a rooster attached to their bikes, all of them making noise.] "
13,12,The F Word,65056,Kyle,Yes. 
13,12,The F Word,65060,Kyle,Sounds good. 
13,12,The F Word,65092,Kyle,Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now. 
13,12,The F Word,65104,Kyle,"W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of our town. "
13,12,The F Word,65109,Kyle,We aren't talking about gay people. 
13,12,The F Word,65113,Kyle,"Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag. "
13,12,The F Word,65128,Kyle,[exasperated] Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag. 
13,12,The F Word,65174,Kyle,I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again. 
13,12,The F Word,65181,Kyle,"We're sorry, Mayor. "
13,12,The F Word,65199,Kyle,"We gotta run! [the boys leave the stage quickly. A biker throws his chain towards the stage, catching Emmanuel Lewis by the right ankle and pulling him off the stage and down the street.] "
13,12,The F Word,65203,Kyle,Yeah. You definitely made your point. 
13,12,The F Word,65208,Kyle,I don't either. 
13,12,The F Word,65223,Kyle,"Yeah! We did it, you guys! [he and Stan hug] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65279,Kyle,Will somebody shut him up? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65298,Kyle,"Oh God, no! [Cartman has made his own graphic introduction full of poses] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65367,Kyle,"""These, are the morning announcements."" [Butters shushes him and he buries his face in his arms again.] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65454,Kyle,"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want. "
13,14,Pee,65475,Kyle,"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first? "
13,14,Pee,65480,Kyle,You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water? 
13,14,Pee,65482,Kyle,"Okay, go ahead. [turns back to Stan and Jimmy] "
13,14,Pee,65484,Kyle,"I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right? "
13,14,Pee,65486,Kyle,"All right, [glances back at Butters] check it out, I- [looks back again and sees what happened.] Butters, BUTTERS! What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?! "
13,14,Pee,65489,Kyle,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there. "
13,14,Pee,65492,Kyle,No they don't! 
13,14,Pee,65495,Kyle,Dude! 
13,14,Pee,65497,Kyle,NO! 
13,14,Pee,65508,Kyle,I'm not getting back in the water. 
13,14,Pee,65510,Kyle,"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back? "
13,14,Pee,65512,Kyle,Do you pee in the pool? 
13,14,Pee,65514,Kyle,"Aw, come on! "
13,14,Pee,65516,Kyle,Most likely. 
13,14,Pee,65520,Kyle,So what? 
13,14,Pee,65522,Kyle,"Well then they're not minorities, are they? "
13,14,Pee,65524,Kyle,"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?! "
13,14,Pee,65526,Kyle,"No, you're the minority! "
13,14,Pee,65535,Kyle,"Blow it out your ass, Cartman! [leaves the table without taking a bite from his hamburger. He walks by an elderly couple in a pool] "
13,14,Pee,65538,Kyle,"Eewww! [walks away quickly. Nearby, a man takes a water sample] "
13,14,Pee,65561,Kyle,"Aaaaah! GROSS! [leaves the game and makes a run for it. A volcano blows up and chunks of lava drop all over the place. The wave pool gets unstable, threatening to throw people out with its wild waves] "
13,14,Pee,65565,Kyle,"[running up some stairs in Drop Zone!!] Aw, sick! [the pee below him is rising] "
13,14,Pee,65589,Kyle,Aahhh... 
13,14,Pee,65591,Kyle,No way! 
13,14,Pee,65594,Kyle,"Dude, that's all pee! "
13,14,Pee,65596,Kyle,I'll die if I do swim in it! 
13,14,Pee,65598,Kyle,Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?! 
13,14,Pee,65600,Kyle,..WHAT? 
13,14,Pee,65602,Kyle,You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom! 
13,14,Pee,65604,Kyle,That is gross!! 
13,14,Pee,65608,Kyle,"Ah, god-damnit! [climbs down the sign and into the pee. He holds his face high up as much as he can as he swims across] Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, [He climbs up and joins his friends on the plateau. He pants, dripping with pee] "
13,14,Pee,65639,Kyle,"Dude, why the hell aren't people coming to help us? "
13,14,Pee,65644,Kyle,"Yeah, well people should [looks at Stan and Butters] know that peeing in pools is [looks at Jimmy] bad! "
13,14,Pee,65648,Kyle,[spreads his arms in refusal] NO! 
13,14,Pee,65650,Kyle,Not in pee! 
13,14,Pee,65652,Kyle,[looks back at the other boys] Oh who pees in the shower?! 
13,14,Pee,65655,Kyle,"You don't pee in the shower, dude. That's fucking disgusting! "
13,14,Pee,65657,Kyle,Jesus Christ! 
13,14,Pee,65678,Kyle,Let's just get this over with! 
13,14,Pee,65680,Kyle,Yes. 
13,14,Pee,65682,Kyle,What?! 
13,14,Pee,65684,Kyle,Why?! 
13,14,Pee,65687,Kyle,"[drops the papers on the ground] I am not, NOT, d-rinking pee! "
13,14,Pee,65692,Kyle,That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down. 
13,14,Pee,65694,Kyle,No! 
13,14,Pee,65714,Kyle,I'm thinking about it! 
13,14,Pee,65717,Kyle,"Gah, ah. [swallows once more] Gaagh. "
13,14,Pee,65720,Kyle,Aaahh. Well- [gulps down the rest of the glass and throws the glass away] AAAAH! [the glass breaks on a boulder off screen] 
13,14,Pee,65725,Kyle,[pissed off] ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! [more rope ladders drop down from the other helicopters as the rescuers cheer] 
13,14,Pee,65731,Kyle,"That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot. "
13,14,Pee,65733,Kyle,Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped! 
13,14,Pee,65735,Kyle,"Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas! "
13,14,Pee,65739,Kyle,What the hell for?! 
13,14,Pee,65741,Kyle,[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH! 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65769,Kyle,"Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65793,Kyle,"Jesus, dude. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65802,Kyle,"I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65806,Kyle,What?! 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65810,Kyle,"Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65813,Kyle,So what happens to us now? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65833,Kyle,"Oh God, it's true. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65836,Kyle,"[reaching him] Butters! Butters, stop it! "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65838,Kyle,"[pulls him away from the bush] Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny! "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65840,Kyle,"No! Butters, stop! [slaps him] "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65842,Kyle,"Stop it! Stop! [pulls him back and flings him to the ground. They fight for a few seconds, then break down and cry out] Oh God! Oh God, help us! "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65866,Kyle,Hello? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65869,Kyle,"Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65896,Kyle,"Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. [Butters stops trimming the tree, the men all look at Kyle] "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65898,Kyle,"Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. [the therapist turns around and walks away from the group, then places a call] "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65921,Kyle,"Okay so, what exactly are we doing now? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65925,Kyle,...As soon as what's dead? [the men groan] 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65944,Kyle,I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything. 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65947,Kyle,What? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65950,Kyle,What bastard? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65972,Kyle,[unsure] I guess it... feels great. Thanks. [Butters looks pissed off] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,65994,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book? "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66001,Kyle,"No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66003,Kyle,I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. [the door opens and a pissed-off Cartman enters and closes the door] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66005,Kyle,[picks up his book] Why the hell was this book banned?! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66014,Kyle,"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66018,Kyle,"Yeah, sweet! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66020,Kyle,"[starts typing] The Tale of... [can't think of anything, so his smile disappears] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66023,Kyle,"Oh that's, [giggles] yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one... "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66053,Kyle,"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66076,Kyle,What? [the other boys can't believe it] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66082,Kyle,"Yeah, we wrote that! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66084,Kyle,"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66102,Kyle,"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66112,Kyle,"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the- "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66142,Kyle,The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66146,Kyle,Yes! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66169,Kyle,I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66172,Kyle,What?! [Stan's hands go from his chin to his knees] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66174,Kyle,"Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! [Sarah Jessica Parker hears her name and looks at the boys] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66192,Kyle,"Guys, stop, stop! [Kyle and Stan walk into view towards Cartman and Kenny] We don't have to do this! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66194,Kyle,Butters wrote a second book! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66197,Kyle,We can get people to believe us now! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66212,Kyle,A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66230,Kyle,"Ah... Oh Butters, [steps forward] it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning. "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66248,Kyle,"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards! "
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66257,Kyle,So where's the KFC now? 
14,3,Medicinal Fried Chicken,66277,Kyle,...So no KFC? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66512,Kyle,How the hell do you have more friends than me? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66514,Kyle,"How many friends do you have, Kenny? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66516,Kyle,What? How the hell do I only have thirty-seven friends? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66520,Kyle,"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66523,Kyle,"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. [smiles] "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66526,Kyle,"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66532,Kyle,"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66534,Kyle,There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66569,Kyle,"I think I'll add some more... pigs. [done] Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there. [moves his avatar to his corn fields and adds one] There we go. Nice. [a click and a small whoosh are heard, and Kyle looks at his screen. ""You have 29 friends""] Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends. [a click and a small whoosh are heard. ""You have 28 friends."" More of these sounds are heard as Kyle's friend count drops] Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! [Kyle does what he can, but keeps losing friends] "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66595,Kyle,Can I come in? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66598,Kyle,I... don't... have... any... friends... 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66600,Kyle,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66602,Kyle,"'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66604,Kyle,Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days! 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66606,Kyle,"[rushes up to Stan, falls on his knees, and grabs the lower part of his friend's jacket] You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehease! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66610,Kyle,"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button... [Stan does so] and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm... [Stan does so] Okay, now I can read the sign you put up... "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66612,Kyle,"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66660,Kyle,I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66662,Kyle,"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66664,Kyle,I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66666,Kyle,No. What's chatroulette? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66669,Kyle,"Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66671,Kyle,"[a look of disgust comes over him] Aww, that's some dude jacking off! [turns away quickly] "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66673,Kyle,That's just a guy's penis too! 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66675,Kyle,"[turns away quickly] Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66681,Kyle,"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66705,Kyle,"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here! [walks to the bedroom door] Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! [about to open the door] "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66710,Kyle,"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66712,Kyle,Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too! 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66726,Kyle,"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome! [a new sound is heard] What the hell is that? Stan? [Stan appears on Kyle's farm and walks to the middle of the screen] "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66728,Kyle,[perplexed] ...What? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66730,Kyle,"[looks around making sure the coast is clear] Dude, w-what are you doing? "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66732,Kyle,Profile status? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66734,Kyle,"Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66736,Kyle,Dude! Dude okay! S-Stop! I'm sorry! [pulls up Stan's status] Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66738,Kyle,Café World. 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66740,Kyle,"An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66751,Kyle,"Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66753,Kyle,What? Why? 
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66755,Kyle,"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66757,Kyle,"Unh, that does it! "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66762,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. [moves the cursor to the Send button and clicks it. With the message sent, Kyle moves the cursor to the left side of the screen and selects ""Remove from Friends,"" and clicks that. A popup window shows up: ""Kip Drordy - Remove from Friends?"" He clicks on ""Remove from Friends"" and Facebook tells him his friend is removed.] "
14,5,200,66790,Kyle,"You should know, fatass. "
14,5,200,66794,Kyle,Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him. 
14,5,200,66803,Kyle,"Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything. "
14,5,200,66829,Kyle,"Dude, what did you do? "
14,5,200,66864,Kyle,"[to Tolkien] Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again. "
14,5,200,66904,Kyle,"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate? "
14,5,200,66906,Kyle,K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag? 
14,5,200,66910,Kyle,"Aww, come on! This is ridiculous! [pounds hands on table] "
14,5,200,66913,Kyle,"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight? "
14,5,200,66918,Kyle,There doesn't have to be... 
14,5,200,66956,Kyle,"But Muhammad can't be seen, Dad. "
14,5,200,66997,Kyle,What kind of extremists are these? [Yates looks over the note] 
14,5,200,67025,Kyle,We can't give him over to the gingers! 
14,6,201,67116,Kyle,Aw crap. 
14,6,201,67172,Kyle,"Really sorry about all this, dude. [to Stan] So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here. "
14,6,201,67174,Kyle,"[thinks a bit, then snaps his fingers] Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it! "
14,6,201,67176,Kyle,Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig? 
14,6,201,67178,Kyle,"I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! [they all run off] "
14,6,201,67191,Kyle,"Come on, Muhammad, the door is open. "
14,6,201,67194,Kyle,"Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand. "
14,6,201,67199,Kyle,"Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications! "
14,6,201,67217,Kyle,"Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now! "
14,6,201,67219,Kyle,"Oh, you are not doing that again! "
14,6,201,67221,Kyle,Stop talking with your stupid hand! 
14,6,201,67229,Kyle,Dude! 
14,6,201,67232,Kyle,We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist! 
14,6,201,67322,Kyle,"Oh, yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back. "
14,6,201,67328,Kyle,"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works. "
14,6,201,67335,Kyle,"Look, man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear. "
14,6,201,67339,Kyle,"Wwait, what? "
14,6,201,67341,Kyle,"Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?! "
14,6,201,67348,Kyle,You gotta be kidding me! 
14,6,201,67355,Kyle,"Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67374,Kyle,"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67395,Kyle,"[in studio] When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67465,Kyle,"Please, sir. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67550,Kyle,"[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67553,Kyle,If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself. 
14,7,Crippled Summer,67556,Kyle,"We're here for Towelie, fatass! "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67558,Kyle,"This is serious, you fucking asshole! "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67561,Kyle,But he's just using his time on television to rant about- 
14,7,Crippled Summer,67564,Kyle,Oh my God! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67641,Kyle,"Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Something's going on. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67643,Kyle,"""What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67651,Kyle,"Aww. Cartman, you can change things about yourself. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67655,Kyle,[reassessing his assumption] What?! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67663,Kyle,"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid! "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67667,Kyle,How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67669,Kyle,"I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67901,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? [Gerald and Sheila pause. They look at each other, then turn back to their son] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67905,Kyle,"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage"". "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67908,Kyle,She said they're from New Jersey. 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67910,Kyle,Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight. 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67912,Kyle,"Know what, Ma? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67945,Kyle,[glaring at him] Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning? 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67955,Kyle,Where the hell are they coming from?! [a bottle of Corona beer lands in front of the boys and shatters] 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67998,Kyle,"[approaching] Hey, dudes. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68000,Kyle,What are you talking about? 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68002,Kyle,So what? 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68004,Kyle,"No, it doesn't! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68006,Kyle,I'm not from Jersey. I was born here. 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68008,Kyle,What's strike three?! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68011,Kyle,"Shut the fuck up! [grabs his hat back and puts it on, then looks at the other boys] What? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68013,Kyle,Why does it matter?! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68016,Kyle,"No, it isn't! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68022,Kyle,"No. [removes his hat] Couldn't be. [opens the top drawer of the vanity and pulls out a pair of scissors. He begins to cut his hair, slowly, then faster and faster. He gets some styling gel and rubs it into his hair. He gets a razor out to shape his eyebrows, cuts more of his hair off, rips the sleeves off his shirt, gets a bracelet and puts it on his right forearm, gets more gel and rubs a design onto his shirt, then is shocked at what he sees in the mirror] Oh my God! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68024,Kyle,"Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. [goes about putting stuff away and closing all the drawers] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68026,Kyle,"Not now, Mom. Please. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68028,Kyle,"All right, all right. [opens the door and see his mom, who's really Jerseyfied herself. He's speechless] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68032,Kyle,"[enunciating] What am I, Mom? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68034,Kyle,[getting scared] What are you saying?! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68036,Kyle,[looks at his new look] No! I don't wanna look like this! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68039,Kyle,I can hide it! [hops off the bed] Nobody ever has to know! [puts his hat back on and walks out the bedroom door] I can't ever let anybody know! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68059,Kyle,"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68061,Kyle,That's enough! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68063,Kyle,"[loses his temper via short temper] Aaaarrghhhhhh! [runs at Cartman and pins him hard against a tree] I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! [lets go and walks away angrily. Cartman backs up a bit without saying a word, then breaks down wailing] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68109,Kyle,[looks at Cartman for a few seconds] Why? 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68111,Kyle,You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them. 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68113,Kyle,I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68117,Kyle,"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll... [his expression changes quickly] Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68119,Kyle,"No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68152,Kyle,"Oh, God. [grabs his head and stumbles away, then falls on all fours] Wuh. Aah. [waves his hand at Stan and Kenny] Get out of here! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68154,Kyle,"Agggh! Agggh! [pulls out a tube of gel and puts some on his left hand] No! [quickly greases up his hair, takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves, puts on a necklace, combs his hair, puts two rings on his left hand, and writes ""KYLeY-B"" on his T-shirt] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68156,Kyle,"[approaches Snooki; in Jersey accent] Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68158,Kyle,You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage! [Snooki babbles and says her name] You've got cabbage in your muff! [Snooki continues babbling] You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! [Snooki continues babbling and Kyle finally fells her with a left hook. Snooki whimpers and escapes through a window. Cartman sobs a bit and puts his pants up] 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68169,Kyle,"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68172,Kyle,"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing. "
14,10,Insheeption,68181,Kyle,What's it say? 
14,10,Insheeption,68221,Kyle,[walks up to Stan and puts a hand on his left shoulder] Dude. What's wrong with you? 
14,10,Insheeption,68223,Kyle,Maybe you should go talk to the counselor. 
14,10,Insheeption,68523,Kyle,"But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with. "
14,10,Insheeption,68525,Kyle,How do you know... [this stops Stan cold] that wasn't your therapy? [Dr. Chinstrap walks up and begins his accompaniment...] 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69265,Kyle,Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode. 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69408,Kyle,"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right? "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69410,Kyle,"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay. "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69413,Kyle,He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good. 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69415,Kyle,"Let's hear it, Cartman! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69450,Kyle,Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69501,Kyle,"Just let us see your iPad, Cartman. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69503,Kyle,"So, plug it in. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69510,Kyle,"You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69512,Kyle,"Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- [the doors fly open and three men rush in] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69514,Kyle,What? Ready for what? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69517,Kyle,"What ""agreement""?! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69519,Kyle,"Hey! You can't do that! [the second man pulls out a tape measure to measure the circumference of Kyle's head, the third man prepares to take Kyle's blood] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69521,Kyle,What are you talking about?! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69523,Kyle,The water tank? [gets off the scale and away from the men] Hey I'm not going with you! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69526,Kyle,[off-camera] You guys! [runs onto the basketball court] You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69528,Kyle,"It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69530,Kyle,"I don't know, I didn't read them! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69532,Kyle,Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69535,Kyle,"You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions? "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69538,Kyle,"Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? [at that moment two limousines pull up and men begin pouring out of them] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69540,Kyle,Gahhh! [runs away] 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69542,Kyle,"Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69544,Kyle,"Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69546,Kyle,But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I- 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69549,Kyle,AAHH! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69559,Kyle,Dad! You tasered my dad! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69590,Kyle,What is this? What's going on? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69592,Kyle,...What? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69596,Kyle,"Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident! "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69600,Kyle,We didn't read them! 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69605,Kyle,The first what? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69628,Kyle,[with his mouth sewn onto Junichi's ass and bandages bound around them to make sure it stays that way] (I need some help! I can't take it!) 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69630,Kyle,(I can't take it! I want out right now!) 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69632,Kyle,(Yes! Please! Let me go!) 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69641,Kyle,(You're fine!) 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69643,Kyle,(Yaaaaah!) [poops into the woman's mouth violently] 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69700,Kyle,(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!) 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69702,Kyle,(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!) 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69704,Kyle,(NOOOO!) [a door flies open and a group of men rush in] 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69714,Kyle,"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) [a buzzer sounds and the ER splits in two, revealing that it was all a setup to see if Kyle would finally read an agreement before signing it. The whole grouped just went around the headquarters and back in. Steve Jobs appears and walks up to the HumancentiPad] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69718,Kyle,"(Oh, shit!) "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69745,Kyle,(Yes. I promise I'll read.) 
15,2,Funnybot,69782,Kyle,"Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea. "
15,2,Funnybot,69785,Kyle,"Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either. "
15,2,Funnybot,69835,Kyle,A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home! 
15,2,Funnybot,69845,Kyle,"Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours! "
15,2,Funnybot,69910,Kyle,"Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this. "
15,2,Funnybot,69922,Kyle,"Butters! Butters, is everything okay? "
15,2,Funnybot,69931,Kyle,"Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend! "
15,2,Funnybot,69936,Kyle,"I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs. "
15,2,Funnybot,69947,Kyle,"Dude, killing everyone isn't funny! "
15,2,Funnybot,69965,Kyle,Wait! Wait a minute. [thinks] What about a logic loop? 
15,2,Funnybot,69967,Kyle,"Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out. "
15,2,Funnybot,69975,Kyle,It's working! [clenches fists in anticipation] 
15,2,Funnybot,69985,Kyle,"No problem, Funnybot. "
15,3,Royal Pudding,70035,Kyle,"[noticing him] Where are you going? [Ike reaches the front door and has trouble getting it open. Kyle catches up] Ike, where are you going? "
15,3,Royal Pudding,70040,Kyle,[looks around] ...I don't know. 
15,3,Royal Pudding,70042,Kyle,"Well, could-couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay? "
15,3,Royal Pudding,70049,Kyle,I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take- 
15,3,Royal Pudding,70051,Kyle,I'm just doing the line. 
15,3,Royal Pudding,70053,Kyle,"Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am. "
15,3,Royal Pudding,70122,Kyle,"Oh no, dental floss, what will I do? "
15,3,Royal Pudding,70155,Kyle,"I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. [smiles proudly for a while] "
15,3,Royal Pudding,70158,Kyle,"Hmmm, yeah. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70164,Kyle,"[looks at Craig, who looks back] ...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70171,Kyle,"You get in trouble again, Cartman? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70177,Kyle,"[skeptical, as is tradition] No they didn't. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70181,Kyle,That doesn't make any sense. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70189,Kyle,"How big do they say mine is? [it's 2.4, just like Craig's. The boys continue talking amongst themselves. At the far end of the hall, Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey walk by and stop to look at the boys; Mr. Mackey is carrying a cup of coffee] "
15,4,T.M.I.,70196,Kyle,['Well everyone has already seen it nothing we can do about it now. ']
15,4,T.M.I.,70210,Kyle,Didn't you forget something? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70212,Kyle,You measured everyone's wiener except for yours. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70214,Kyle,[grabs the notepad and has a look] Thirteen point seven inches? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70216,Kyle,Your wiener is not 13 inches long! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70410,Kyle,"[through his laughter] Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70412,Kyle,I'm so happy! [wipes off the tip of his nose] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70415,Kyle,"Oh no! It's that [puts up his right hand to block his view, shuts his eyes and looks away] super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70417,Kyle,"Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! [a baby tries to get his bearing in order to crawl, but slowly collapses. Another one looks in a mirror, then lowers his hed] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70420,Kyle,Why do they have to put this on TV?! [a doctor carries a baby in order to calm him down] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70423,Kyle,"Aaaggh, God. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70425,Kyle,"I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! [runs off, leaving Stan on the sofa looking away] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70428,Kyle,What exactly can I do to help? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70430,Kyle,"Oh it's, it's so sad. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70433,Kyle,"[at first surprised, now suspicious] What are you doing here? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70435,Kyle,[remains suspicious] ...What are you doing here?! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70438,Kyle,Why do you have a video camera? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70441,Kyle,"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70443,Kyle,Thanks. [walks to a window looking over a parking lot. The nurse walks off in the opposite direction] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70445,Kyle,What's going on?! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70450,Kyle,So what are you doing?! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70452,Kyle,"Alright, what is it?! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70454,Kyle,Why do you need me? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70456,Kyle,I knew you were doing something terrible! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70458,Kyle,Lots of people will when I tell them! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70460,Kyle,You what? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70462,Kyle,A thousand dollars. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70467,Kyle,There's a big wait to sit down. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70473,Kyle,Jesus Christ. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70478,Kyle,Wow... 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70487,Kyle,"[turns away from the window and walks a few steps] And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70491,Kyle,"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70493,Kyle,"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70495,Kyle,Crack baby... basketball. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70497,Kyle,"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out. [leads Kyle inside and to his room, then gets on the computer and goes to a Web site.] See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular! [soon, babies are heard. Kyle is showing Stan one of the Crack Baby Fight videos] I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before. [Stan stays quiet] It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits. [Stan stays quiet] Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70519,Kyle,"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need. [glances at Stan] Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything. [glances at Stan again] Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? [glances at Stan and waits a bit longer for a reply] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70521,Kyle,"[puts his right hand on his stomach as if punched there] Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70523,Kyle,"I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit! [frightens himself and glances at Stan, then look away] Okay, so, see ya. [goes out the front door and closes it behind him] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70528,Kyle,I need to talk to you. [puts a folder down on the desk] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70530,Kyle,[opens the folder] In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70532,Kyle,But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70534,Kyle,Gut they're the ones risking injury. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70536,Kyle,"The government could come after us, Cartman. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70538,Kyle,So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70540,Kyle,A hot tub?! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70542,Kyle,Gravy? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70544,Kyle,No way. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70546,Kyle,"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70548,Kyle,What other companies? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70566,Kyle,"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies. [Stan just blinks, still half-awake. Kyle turns and looks at him] Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70568,Kyle,It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! [turns around and walks out] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70577,Kyle,"[setting up] Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70579,Kyle,"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70581,Kyle,...What? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70605,Kyle,"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course. [gets no reaction from Stan] Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70612,Kyle,What? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70622,Kyle,"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70625,Kyle,Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70627,Kyle,You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70631,Kyle,"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70635,Kyle,"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go. [something grabs his attention] No way! [a brand new building is shown: ""South Park Orphanage for Crack Babies""] This is it! "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70637,Kyle,"This is it, Stan! [runs across the street and enters the orphanage. Stan trails behind. Several workers are putting up wallpaper] It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh, [sees Ms. Williams] excuse me, what is this place? "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70639,Kyle,But who paid for all this? [Stan catches up and the nurse leaves] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70641,Kyle,You don't think that-? But he isn't real. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70887,Kyle,Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70890,Kyle,Oh God... 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70894,Kyle,"Here, this one's from me, Stan. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70900,Kyle,Yeah dude! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70902,Kyle,Yeah they're the best! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70943,Kyle,But that's our music! We like it! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70953,Kyle,Gross! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70963,Kyle,"[to Cartman] Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! [has Cartman listen to his song] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70965,Kyle,[seeing Stan approach] Hey Stan. [hands Cartman his iPod] 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70967,Kyle,"Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70969,Kyle,Sure. [they walk off to a small clearing] What's up? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70971,Kyle,Oh. Really? Um well that's okay. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70973,Kyle,Why? What's it sound like? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70975,Kyle,"What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70977,Kyle,No. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70979,Kyle,"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71027,Kyle,"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71031,Kyle,"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71035,Kyle,"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71038,Kyle,"Yeah, we got him! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71041,Kyle,We're gonna level up to detective! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71043,Kyle,"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71046,Kyle,You don't wanna eat it? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71049,Kyle,"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71051,Kyle,"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71074,Kyle,[laughing] I know! That's so hilarious! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71078,Kyle,"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh- "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71080,Kyle,"Alright dude, we were going to the movies. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71082,Kyle,"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!"" "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71084,Kyle,"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71086,Kyle,"[thinks about it, then sighs] Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71096,Kyle,"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71102,Kyle,"Shhh, you're doing it again! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71108,Kyle,"No, they're penguins! Stop it! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71113,Kyle,"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! [leaves his seat and walks out. Kenny and Cartman follow suit] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71121,Kyle,"[turns around] Dude, you've... you've changed. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71123,Kyle,"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- [poop starts coming out of his mouth and spewing all over the place. He then turns into a huge turd - this is how Stan sees him. The rest of us see him normally. Stan turns and walks away. Kyle turns and walks away in the opposite direction] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71159,Kyle,Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71163,Kyle,"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71165,Kyle,[sighs gruffly] Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71167,Kyle,That's what they're talking about on the news! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71169,Kyle,Yes! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71171,Kyle,You wanna bet? [begins to move off] Let's go ask my Dad right now! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71221,Kyle,"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71225,Kyle,"I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71227,Kyle,"[puts his notebook away and closes his locker door] NO. I can't, Wendy. [walking away] All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go. [stops] And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally [makes a fist with his right hand and pounds it into his left palm] positive attitude. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71229,Kyle,What's the matter dude? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71231,Kyle,"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one. [reaches for a burger and bites into it. That burger might have been in Cartman's underwear] Mmm. Hm, wow [swallows] This is really good, Cartman. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71233,Kyle,Yeah. [a girl walks by] Hey Riley! Try this hamburger. [hands her a burger] Cartman made them himself. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71235,Kyle,"Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71260,Kyle,"About three minutes, fatass! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71264,Kyle,"[rushes up in time to stop him] Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71288,Kyle,"Stan? [Stan is looking away, drunk] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71290,Kyle,"Hey, Stan! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71292,Kyle,"Stan, are you alright? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71294,Kyle,"Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. [smiles. Cartman leans back and looks over from the stand] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71296,Kyle,Dude. Have you been drinking? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71298,Kyle,"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh. [Cartman takes a quick order, then looks back at Stan and Kyle] Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71300,Kyle,See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71302,Kyle,"Yeah, it's fine. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71304,Kyle,"Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71306,Kyle,"Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71355,Kyle,"There, ten mediums and five medium-rares. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71357,Kyle,"Next please. [smiles, but quickly frowns upon seeing the next customer] Oh, hey. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71359,Kyle,What are you doing? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71361,Kyle,I don't know. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71364,Kyle,Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71366,Kyle,"[rolls his eyes] Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71369,Kyle,"You said ""fuck you"" to my face, Stan. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71372,Kyle,"Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71393,Kyle,"You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71401,Kyle,"[enters with Cartman and Kenny] Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71414,Kyle,"Look, guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71417,Kyle,['Hey Texans! Let me through we want a treaty! ']
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71419,Kyle,Better than being a fat-ass Texan! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71421,Kyle,"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71440,Kyle,So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71465,Kyle,[after a few seconds] He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner? 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71469,Kyle,Butters? 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71471,Kyle,"[hugs himself] Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71474,Kyle,"Wugh, game on. [puts on his mustache] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71552,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell is this?! [he's holding a poster Cartman designed: ""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol. Permission to shoot on sight.""] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71554,Kyle,"""Wanted by the U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71556,Kyle,Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71619,Kyle,"[noticing Cartman] Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71623,Kyle,"Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. [everyone falls silent. Butters stands up on his chair and raises his arms slowly] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71630,Kyle,The blond kid? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71634,Kyle,[angry] How do you know?! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71637,Kyle,What's that? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71647,Kyle,"Dude, that's so wrong! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71674,Kyle,What's up? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71676,Kyle,"Dude, that's fucked up. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71678,Kyle,It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see?? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71726,Kyle,That's not funny. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71728,Kyle,[rolls his eyes] I'm not looking at that! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71730,Kyle,It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71750,Kyle,"So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71757,Kyle,Where is it coming from? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71759,Kyle,If it's on the school network we can track the IP address. [takes Craig's iPhone and sets about tracing the IP address. The kids head into the hallway and pass by the music room] This way. In here. [they stop at the music room door] Whoever it is using the computer in the music room. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71762,Kyle,Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71764,Kyle,"One. [Stan makes fists and tenses up] Two. Three! [opens the door and the nine kids run in, but they're all surprised at what they see. It's a gerbil typing away into the Eavesdropper Web site. This week on Spee: Jenny Simons Still On Suicide Watch] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71766,Kyle,Get it! [the kids give chase. Craig and Kyle run into each other and fall trying to get the gerbil. Bebe and Tolkien fall giving chase] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71770,Kyle,Wikileaks. [Kyle is now at the computer looking at the login screen] It says here his name is Wikileaks. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71816,Kyle,What? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71819,Kyle,What is that thing? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71826,Kyle,Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71852,Kyle,Here's a shoebox! [goes for the shoebox. Vernon walks in at that moment] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71859,Kyle,Grab him! [Butters scoops Lemmiwinks into the shoe box and the group runs out the front door] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71874,Kyle,What the hell happened?! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71895,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes. "
15,12,1%,72230,Kyle,Four weeks we gotta do this? 
15,12,1%,72290,Kyle,"Shut the hell up, Cartman! "
15,12,1%,72292,Kyle,How do you murder a stuffed animal?! 
15,12,1%,72363,Kyle,"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals? "
15,12,1%,72367,Kyle,"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire. "
15,12,1%,72398,Kyle,"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass! "
15,12,1%,72453,Kyle,We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72469,Kyle,"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72471,Kyle,"[looks over his shoulder angrily] Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?! "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72475,Kyle,How is that gonna help?! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72486,Kyle,What? This isn't history. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72491,Kyle,What?? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72493,Kyle,We're not basing research for our report on this crap! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72495,Kyle,[at Stan] Dude! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72497,Kyle,"[sighs] Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with! "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72506,Kyle,"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth! "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72515,Kyle,"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72517,Kyle,We saw it on your channel. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72530,Kyle,You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72533,Kyle,How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. [a knock is heard at the front door and Kyle goes to answer it] 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72535,Kyle,...Uh oh. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72537,Kyle,I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po- 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72539,Kyle,Ack dude! [backs up as Sawitzky walks towards him] 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72598,Kyle,"[through gritted teeth] Dude, there's a guy with a gun here! "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72601,Kyle,Would you guys stop?! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72633,Kyle,"No, ah I don't. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72635,Kyle,I actually only just said that sarcastically. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72637,Kyle,"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72667,Kyle,I'm not a professor. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72669,Kyle,You are the fucking History Channel! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72673,Kyle,"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72675,Kyle,"[having trouble with small talk] Wow, awesome. Um... "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72677,Kyle,"Um... so... [behind him, everyone involved in the portal matter is watching them] So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72679,Kyle,Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72682,Kyle,"Yeah, it was cool, thanks. [looks over his shoulder. Miles motions at him to continue] Um, so... Is there any way you'd "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72684,Kyle,"You know, could youuu... "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72686,Kyle,Would you please just open your wormhole?! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72688,Kyle,[sighs in exasperation] Errh! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72694,Kyle,"Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. [behind the rock, Natalie's legs go up in the air] "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72696,Kyle,I guess we should all realize... [the portal is activated] that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. [the portal shoots out into space towards planet Plymouth] 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72713,Kyle,"[throws up his arms in exasperation] Oh, come on!! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72755,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72760,Kyle,That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?! 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72785,Kyle,"[slowly so that there's no mistake] My name. Is not. ""Kyel"". "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72960,Kyle,I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72963,Kyle,"How was jail, fatass?! "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72979,Kyle,Is your mom always like that dude? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72984,Kyle,"Cartman, it was actually really lame. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73002,Kyle,"I know, fatass. I was there. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73004,Kyle,That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73006,Kyle,Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73008,Kyle,Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. [police siren is heard offscreen.] 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73010,Kyle,What's going on? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73012,Kyle,From what? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73060,Kyle,"Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73063,Kyle,So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73065,Kyle,"All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73067,Kyle,"Aw, he's dead? "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73073,Kyle,[puts his arm around Clyde] You hear that Clyde? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73077,Kyle,Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73173,Kyle,[frowning] What? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73246,Kyle,That... was six grand? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73250,Kyle,"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73258,Kyle,"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73261,Kyle,Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73274,Kyle,You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito! 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73287,Kyle,"Dude, that's terrible! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73293,Kyle,That's the chemical equation for gold? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73295,Kyle,"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73359,Kyle,Yeah! 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73362,Kyle,What does that mean? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73369,Kyle,"[leans forward] Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!"" "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73402,Kyle,"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73405,Kyle,What's he doing? 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73437,Kyle,"[offscreen] Copy, tango. Clear vantage point? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73439,Kyle,"Alright, Butters. Bring it in. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73441,Kyle,"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73450,Kyle,Go Cartman! [Cartman runs up and comes on the stage. He cheerfully pulls his shirt out near the nipple area. Stan takes a picture. Four agents come up to chase Cartman.] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73504,Kyle,"So, what do you want to do now? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73510,Kyle,"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73524,Kyle,How can that be? Already? 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73526,Kyle,How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73532,Kyle,But that's stupid. [Kenny moves to the right-hand side] How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73537,Kyle,"Yep, that's great. [glances at the other kids] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73574,Kyle,"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73578,Kyle,"W-what's the matter, Kenny? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73582,Kyle,"Hey! [the boys approach Kenny] Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73603,Kyle,"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting? "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73607,Kyle,Benedict Arnold. [the three boys walk away] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73609,Kyle,Kenny? 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73613,Kyle,You guys are sellouts. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73615,Kyle,You're freaking sellouts! 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73628,Kyle,"[has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more. [Cartman raises his left hand a bit] Yeah, yeah freeze there. [a man comes into view with his little son] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73633,Kyle,"Yeah, good idea. [a doctor comes out of the clinic] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73636,Kyle,"[approaches Cartman] We have to face it, Cartman. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73638,Kyle,I really thought it was gonna last. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73640,Kyle,It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean- 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73642,Kyle,I-It's good that it became something else. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73666,Kyle,"Yeah, that's awesome. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73673,Kyle,"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73678,Kyle,It's super awesome. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73698,Kyle,"Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73703,Kyle,"Two, one. Go Cartman! "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73705,Kyle,"Cartman? Go, Cartman. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73708,Kyle,"[observing him though a computer] Yeah. Do it, Cartman. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73724,Kyle,"[to Cartman, angrily] Get out of here. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73726,Kyle,Get. Outta here! [points his finger to the left] 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73729,Kyle,[walks to him] What are you gonna do? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73731,Kyle,No? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73733,Kyle,What does that have to do with Passover? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73753,Kyle,"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73755,Kyle,I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73757,Kyle,"[sighs] If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73804,Kyle,Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73806,Kyle,"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73838,Kyle,What are you doing? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73869,Kyle,"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73891,Kyle,[bangs a nail into a piece of wood] Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73893,Kyle,"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73895,Kyle,It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73897,Kyle,It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73899,Kyle,That's just how God is. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73915,Kyle,This is what God told us to do! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73917,Kyle,You'll see! [Cartman runs away but realizes other families are also doing it. He runs though the corpses of lambs] 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73935,Kyle,Yeah. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73937,Kyle,"[puts his arm around him and smiles] I know, you're not. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73939,Kyle,"[flatly] Happy Passover, Cartman. [the camera moves up to the sun, which now has a Star of David at the center of it.] "
16,5,Butterballs,73943,Kyle,"Where's your lunch, Butters? "
16,5,Butterballs,73954,Kyle,"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters. "
16,5,Butterballs,73961,Kyle,"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her? "
16,5,Butterballs,74042,Kyle, Pansy.   
16,5,Butterballs,74048,Kyle,"He doesn't wanna do it, dude. "
16,5,Butterballs,74052,Kyle,"[stops, then turns around] Why are you doing this, Stan? "
16,5,Butterballs,74054,Kyle,You're gonna stop bullying. 
16,5,Butterballs,74056,Kyle,With Cartman singing about his vagina. 
16,5,Butterballs,74058,Kyle,"Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you! "
16,5,Butterballs,74060,Kyle,Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. [turns around and hurries away] 
16,5,Butterballs,74110,Kyle,"Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker? "
16,5,Butterballs,74112,Kyle,I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere! [walks away] And don't tape that to my locker! [walks into the boys' room and sees Stan waiting by the sink with arms crossed] Oh God. [Stan goes to lock the door] 
16,5,Butterballs,74114,Kyle,Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put all over signs as the poster child for bullying? 
16,5,Butterballs,74116,Kyle,"Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him, and neither do you! "
16,5,Butterballs,74118,Kyle,What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom! 
16,5,Butterballs,74120,Kyle,"Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them. "
16,5,Butterballs,74122,Kyle,"If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?! [long pause] Well?! "
16,5,Butterballs,74124,Kyle,"[slowly] If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet, for free?! "
16,5,Butterballs,74126,Kyle,"[turns around and walks out] Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! [closes the door.] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74176,Kyle,AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! [a shot of Cartman moving down the zip line helplessly] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74179,Kyle,[being interviewed] We were stuck. We were completely stuck. [cut to Cartman running] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74191,Kyle,We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74198,Kyle,"[being interviewed] And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74200,Kyle,We've definitely not done that before! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74202,Kyle,Cool! Ziplining. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74214,Kyle,"[being interviewed] And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."" "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74225,Kyle,"[being interviewed] So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. [the couple arrives] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74229,Kyle,We don't mind. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74240,Kyle,Jesus Christ! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74247,Kyle,"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74259,Kyle,"Dude, did you fart?! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74278,Kyle,"Well? How was it, Cartman? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74283,Kyle,Zipline. [Michael sends him on his way] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74285,Kyle,"[being interviewed] It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74289,Kyle,"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74292,Kyle,STOP! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74306,Kyle,Wugh! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74310,Kyle,[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [a shot of the whole group is shown] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74315,Kyle,It's no use. There's nobody around for miles. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74317,Kyle,[grabs Stan's arms] Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! [another zipliner goes down] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74321,Kyle,Me?! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74323,Kyle,"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74326,Kyle,You fat piece of shit! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74332,Kyle,DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74342,Kyle,"Then stop drinking Double Dew, fatass! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74344,Kyle,You're in a forest! Go take a crap! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74356,Kyle,"[being interviewed] Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74360,Kyle,"Oh, thank God! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74365,Kyle,"AAAAH! [the boys are now shown on horseback in this order: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74368,Kyle,Can we please go faster?! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74371,Kyle,AAAAAAAAAAH! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74379,Kyle,Just go. Go without me. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74381,Kyle,"I can't take it anymore. [his voice gets weaker] Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74386,Kyle,What's the point? 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74390,Kyle,Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74392,Kyle,"Ziplining was your idea, you fatass! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74397,Kyle,Oh no. [Cartman lowers a 20-oz. bottle of Mountain Dew] You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74406,Kyle,Here! [takes Cartman's bottle] Everyone drink some Mountain Dew! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74407,Kyle,"[being interviewed] I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74414,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74416,Kyle,"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74421,Kyle,"So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74423,Kyle,You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74426,Kyle,"You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! [a shot of Kenny, then a shot of the three surviving boys crying. Kyle cries on Cartman's shoulder and Cartman comforts him] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74427,Kyle,"[being interviewed] How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74432,Kyle,Mr. Hankey! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74446,Kyle,"Just tell us, Butters. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74462,Kyle,"[annoyed as well] Will you shut the hell up?! [goes back to taking notes. Cartman finally picks up his pen, but doesn't write anything] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74517,Kyle,"Oh, thanks. [smiles. Nichole turns and walks away, smiling. Kyle sees Craig and Timmy nearby and runs towards them] Dude, that new girl's into me! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74539,Kyle,"Hey guys. Guys! Hold up. [runs up to the girls, who stop and turn to face him] Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74541,Kyle,Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74544,Kyle,"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74546,Kyle,"Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! [runs off] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74550,Kyle,"[back with Craig and Timmy] It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game. [looks back at the girls, who look at him, then giggle as he turns back to the boys] Man, I-I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. [looks back at the girls and waves. They grin and wave back] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74577,Kyle,"You motherfucker! [runs into view and punches Cartman, who falls on his face] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74579,Kyle,What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74581,Kyle,"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74583,Kyle,"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74589,Kyle,What? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74591,Kyle,Who is Cupid Me? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74593,Kyle,You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74595,Kyle,Goddamnit! [walks away angrily] 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74652,Kyle,Hey man. You okay? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74654,Kyle,[sits next to him] What happened? It just didn't work out? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74656,Kyle,"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74658,Kyle,"[scratches his head behind the ear] So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74660,Kyle,"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74662,Kyle,"Huh? [suddenly remembers] Dude, what the fuck? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74700,Kyle,That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Tolkien 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! [walks away] 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74747,Kyle,We don't have kickoffs anymore. [only the TV is heard for a few seconds] 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74782,Kyle,[removes his bra and throws it to the floor] This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?! 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74787,Kyle,We don't even understand how this game is played. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74817,Kyle,"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74819,Kyle,But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday! 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74822,Kyle,We can't. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74833,Kyle,"[steps in] We need you, Butters. You're the man! [Butters begins to feel the anticipation] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74969,Kyle,"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74971,Kyle,"Right, you're not fat. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74974,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? [another obese man rolls up behind them] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74977,Kyle,Why do they even allow those things in stores? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74979,Kyle,You've gotta be kidding me! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74981,Kyle,"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all?? [an obese man and an obese woman squeeze past each other in an aisle on their scooters.] That's YOU one day, fatass![Stan and Kenny leave] Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! [turns and follows Stan and Kenny away. Cartman is left alone with the Oreos and his thoughts] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74986,Kyle,Why? [his eyebrows move to odd positions every so often] 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74988,Kyle,"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you- "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74990,Kyle,[angrily] Oh no! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74992,Kyle,You don't need that! Get off of it. 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74994,Kyle,"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74996,Kyle,What?? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74998,Kyle,So take a shit somewhere else! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75018,Kyle,You have got to be kidding me! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75020,Kyle,We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75022,Kyle,So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75024,Kyle,Who's Honey Boo Boo? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75031,Kyle,"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75047,Kyle,"Come on, hurry it up in there! [inside, a toilet and the two urinals have been removed to make room for the wheelchair-accessible toilet. Cartman rolls up the ramp to get to the toilet] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75049,Kyle,"[starting to fume, steps away from the crowd] This has gone far enough! [the other boys turn to look at him] How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75051,Kyle,Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75053,Kyle,"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75055,Kyle,"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75057,Kyle,"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! [walks away smiling. Tolkien watches him leave, then walks off in the opposite direction. The rest of the boys go back to waiting at the restroom door. Craig watches Kyle leave, then notices Tolkien and follows him] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75061,Kyle,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Tolkien. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. [clicks on a remote to turn down the lights] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75064,Kyle,Fatty Doo Doo? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75067,Kyle,What? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75072,Kyle,[enters and approaches the desk] What have you done? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75074,Kyle,"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75076,Kyle,"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Tolkien, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame?? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75078,Kyle,"When the bar gets lowered, Tolkien, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75085,Kyle,"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75087,Kyle,"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo Boo. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75089,Kyle,What? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75091,Kyle,[a bit shocked] What? Oh my God. 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75122,Kyle,"I'm sorry Tolkien, I had to tell him. His life is in danger. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75125,Kyle,You found a network to buy it? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75151,Kyle,"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again and looks at Cartman, and he strikes her down once again] Did it start with fat people on scooters?[Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] Or did the bar get lowered way before that? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]And then I started thinking, maybe it was us. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] There's no going back, Stan. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again. Two men walk up behind Stan and Kyle, and pass by them] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75154,Kyle,[catches a hint of what the men were talking about] Huh? 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75162,Kyle,I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance. 
16,10,Insecurity,75187,Kyle,"Ike, what's the matter? [Waits a few seconds, then goes in.] Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on? [Ike finishes up and hands the sheet of paper to Kyle. Kyle looks and is suddenly alarmed. Ike has drawn a stick figure of his mom with a UPS man, with big boobs for his mom and a big penis for the UPS man. Ike goes back to crying] Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this? "
16,10,Insecurity,75189,Kyle,"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%- "
16,10,Insecurity,75191,Kyle,Oh no... 
16,10,Insecurity,75193,Kyle,"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do. "
16,10,Insecurity,75195,Kyle,Take a look. [Whips out the sheet of paper Ike drew upon] 
16,10,Insecurity,75197,Kyle,Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man. 
16,10,Insecurity,75200,Kyle,"Yeah dude. [Out in the hall, Randy walks by with a cup of coffee, but he hears them and stops] "
16,10,Insecurity,75202,Kyle,"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time. "
16,10,Insecurity,75205,Kyle,I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing. 
16,10,Insecurity,75207,Kyle,What? 
16,10,Insecurity,75353,Kyle,It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea. 
16,10,Insecurity,75355,Kyle,I know... 
16,10,Insecurity,75357,Kyle,What?! 
16,10,Insecurity,75359,Kyle,"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch! "
16,10,Insecurity,75361,Kyle,"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing! "
16,10,Insecurity,75396,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet. "
16,10,Insecurity,75398,Kyle,"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. [the doorbell rings and he sighs deeply, then goes to answer it. The UPS man is on the other side of the door] "
16,10,Insecurity,75400,Kyle,"Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you? "
16,10,Insecurity,75402,Kyle,"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second. [puzzled, the UPS man comes in and sits down on the armchair. Kyle returns to his spot between his parents, and silence follows for a couple of seconds] So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something? [she stays quiet] Mom? "
16,10,Insecurity,75404,Kyle,"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else! "
16,10,Insecurity,75422,Kyle,"[sees the open door and goes in] Dude, come down here! "
16,10,Insecurity,75430,Kyle,"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man? "
16,11,Going Native,75444,Kyle,Butters? [he and Stan look puzzled] Why? 
16,11,Going Native,75453,Kyle,"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just- "
16,11,Going Native,75494,Kyle,What? 
16,11,Going Native,75498,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him. "
16,11,Going Native,75500,Kyle,"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75746,Kyle,"[dressed as Thor, in his living room] Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75748,Kyle,But what about the costume contest?! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75750,Kyle,Stan can't come. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75753,Kyle,Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75757,Kyle,"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75759,Kyle,"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75761,Kyle,"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75764,Kyle,He looks fine. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75804,Kyle,"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh- "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75807,Kyle,Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75809,Kyle,[turns around] Yeah dude! We are the Avengers! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75811,Kyle,"[turns his skateboard around] Oh, sorry dude. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75819,Kyle,[holds up his sledge hammer] For Odin! For Asgard! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75822,Kyle,Oh my God! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75863,Kyle,"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75870,Kyle,Stan! [leads the other Avengers and the police into Stan's hospital room] 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75872,Kyle,What happened to you? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75878,Kyle,"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75926,Kyle,Stan? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75928,Kyle,The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it. [the low battery indicator pops up - 5% remaining] Oh God. [turns to the gathering crowd] SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER! [turns back to Stan] Hold on Stan! Don't die on us! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75930,Kyle,You're gonna see it. [to the crowd] WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75958,Kyle,Did you do it? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76037,Kyle,What are you people talking about? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76069,Kyle,"Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76071,Kyle,You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76073,Kyle,Because you kind of made it matter. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76075,Kyle,S-so you did superglue it. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76077,Kyle,"Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76172,Kyle,Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76225,Kyle,"Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all. [the phone rings and he answers it.] Hello? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76227,Kyle,"Nothing, watching the election results. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76229,Kyle,What?! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76232,Kyle,"Alright, what is this all about, fatass?! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76234,Kyle,It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76236,Kyle,Sure you do! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76238,Kyle,"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? [Cartman smiles and opens his bedroom door, then shows him in. Inside are stacks and stacks of ballots Cartman has stolen from various states: Nevada, Florida, Idaho, Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Kyle's jaw drops] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76240,Kyle,What the hell is this? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76242,Kyle,I don't believe it. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76244,Kyle,Why do you have these? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76246,Kyle,Dude! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76248,Kyle,"Knock it off, Cartman! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76250,Kyle,"You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! [turns around and walks out. Cartman waits a few seconds and walks to his window. He sees Kyle walk to the sidewalk, then turn right and go down the street.] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76272,Kyle,"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76275,Kyle,Upstairs! First door to the left! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76278,Kyle,But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76282,Kyle,"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76285,Kyle,Guys! You guys! [runs into the group] Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76287,Kyle,Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76289,Kyle,"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76293,Kyle,"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76295,Kyle,"[stares at Butters for a while] Butters, you know something, don't you?! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76297,Kyle,[walks towards Butters] What did Cartman tell you?! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76299,Kyle,Tell us what you know right now! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76303,Kyle,Then you have to tell us! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76305,Kyle,"Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! [Butters falls back, stiff] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76308,Kyle,"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76326,Kyle,Can we please just try and talk to him? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76329,Kyle,"Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76331,Kyle,"I didn't wanna have to do this. [opens his flip phone and presses some keys] but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76333,Kyle,Then just tell me what Cartman is up to! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76337,Kyle,"What? [Kenny mumbles his translation] You mean the missile defense program?! [to Butters] Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76340,Kyle,[still not getting it] Where? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76346,Kyle,What? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76355,Kyle,"All right, where are the missing ballots?! [noticing the President] President Obama? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76359,Kyle,"Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76377,Kyle,"Anything in the basement, Jimmy? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76379,Kyle,Well keep looking. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76381,Kyle,"Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76420,Kyle,"[with a field reporter at City Hall, with the other boys behind them] We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and- "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76422,Kyle,"Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. [sirens and bells sound] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76426,Kyle,What? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76428,Kyle,"[quite confused] I... what? [a woman comes in from screen left with a check for five thousand dollars from P.F. Chang while another woman comes in from screen left with a sign saying ""ONE MILLION TIMES!!!!!""] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76432,Kyle,It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76434,Kyle,"It matters, Stan. It it matters. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76438,Kyle,[realizing where the ballots could be] Oh my God. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76441,Kyle,Look! There they are! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76443,Kyle,"We found it, you guys! [hears some vehicles showing up and looks] Oh no, they followed us! [several black cars pull up and the Chinese pour out of them] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76446,Kyle,No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76454,Kyle,Protect it? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76461,Kyle,Well... if you put it that way... 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76467,Kyle,"I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of peace before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this [holds his hand out], and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76471,Kyle,AAAARGH! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76474,Kyle,That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76476,Kyle,Then take that shit off speaker phone!! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76479,Kyle,How do we have a choice?! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76503,Kyle,[calmly] Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76526,Kyle,[notices the Shitter device and gets angry.] What the hell are you doing?! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76532,Kyle,You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76746,Kyle,"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76752,Kyle,"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76826,Kyle,What? How do you know? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76836,Kyle,"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft? "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76842,Kyle,[turns left] That's it. [walks a bit] That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76844,Kyle,Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. [dramatic flourish] 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76859,Kyle,"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76863,Kyle,You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76876,Kyle,Corey Lanskin? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76878,Kyle,We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76882,Kyle,"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76897,Kyle,So you know it. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76899,Kyle,"We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76903,Kyle,"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76909,Kyle,Can we talk to your supervisor please?! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76914,Kyle,You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76916,Kyle,"Fine, [folds his arms over his chest] then we'll shut our cable off altogether! "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76975,Kyle,He's doing it a-gain. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77219,Kyle,"Yeah, that sucked. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77236,Kyle,You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again? 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77238,Kyle,That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer? 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77240,Kyle,You're a murderer. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77546,Kyle,"Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77548,Kyle,"I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77551,Kyle,"Hey Ike, how's it going? "
17,5,Taming Strange,77553,Kyle,I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77555,Kyle,"Ike, I just want us to be friends again. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77557,Kyle,"Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77560,Kyle,It always has been. See? This is nice. [Foofa steps forward] 
17,5,Taming Strange,77562,Kyle,What? 
17,5,Taming Strange,77564,Kyle,"Ike, is that chewing tobacco? "
17,5,Taming Strange,77566,Kyle,"No, I just don't think it's healthy. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77570,Kyle,"[opens the door and peeks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you? "
17,5,Taming Strange,77572,Kyle,[goes all the way in] No. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77574,Kyle,It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like- 
17,5,Taming Strange,77576,Kyle,Right now. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77578,Kyle,I don't know. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77580,Kyle,What? 
17,5,Taming Strange,77584,Kyle,"[takes a moment to gather them] He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77586,Kyle,"Yeah, he just seems so young. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77591,Kyle,"Let's just give it a chance, Ike. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77604,Kyle,What the fuck is going on?! 
17,5,Taming Strange,77607,Kyle,"I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart! "
17,5,Taming Strange,77609,Kyle,He doesn't even let me near him! 
17,5,Taming Strange,77611,Kyle,What?? 
17,5,Taming Strange,77613,Kyle,"Oh, thanks! [Mr. Mackey is at the IntelliLink panel trying to set things right. The music stops and he stands up] "
17,5,Taming Strange,77615,Kyle,I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77628,Kyle,Hey Ike. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77630,Kyle,"Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77632,Kyle,"I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77634,Kyle,"Ike, I do! I just- "
17,5,Taming Strange,77650,Kyle,[running towards the stage] Ike no! Stop! 
17,5,Taming Strange,77657,Kyle,We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77659,Kyle,That's what I thought. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77701,Kyle,"[walks in from the kitchen and stares at both of them, then firmly says] Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77703,Kyle,"I'm your big brother, Ike! [the doorbell rings] "
17,5,Taming Strange,77706,Kyle,"I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling- "
17,5,Taming Strange,77711,Kyle,Hey! 
17,5,Taming Strange,77724,Kyle,"Will you get out of my living room, please?! [the phone rings and he answers it] Hello?! "
17,5,Taming Strange,77726,Kyle,What? 
17,5,Taming Strange,77728,Kyle,"No, this is his brother. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77730,Kyle,Satisfied with- [thinks a bit] Wait a minute. What medication?! 
17,5,Taming Strange,77733,Kyle,"[confused] Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little brother has been getting from you, and why?! "
17,5,Taming Strange,77735,Kyle,"Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault! "
17,5,Taming Strange,77737,Kyle,You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please? 
17,5,Taming Strange,77739,Kyle,"I dunno! [thinks a bit] Try ""strangetamer."" "
17,5,Taming Strange,77741,Kyle,Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?! 
17,5,Taming Strange,77743,Kyle,That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc! 
17,5,Taming Strange,77747,Kyle,"Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?! "
17,5,Taming Strange,77770,Kyle,Ike! [runs up to him] Wait! [the rest of Yo Gabba Gabba show up] 
17,5,Taming Strange,77772,Kyle,"Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77774,Kyle,"Because you're my little brother, Goddammit! [Ike is awed at this] And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother! "
17,5,Taming Strange,77776,Kyle,"Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it. "
17,5,Taming Strange,77792,Kyle,Ike? 
17,5,Taming Strange,77795,Kyle,"It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike? "
17,5,Taming Strange,77799,Kyle,"Yeah, I bet she does. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77803,Kyle,About what?! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77813,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman, joke's over. [Kenny takes out his phone] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77815,Kyle,Tell everyone you made the cow look like that! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77822,Kyle,Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77827,Kyle,Huh? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77830,Kyle,Nothing. [hops off his chair to leave the classroom] 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77834,Kyle,Wuwhat's going on? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77836,Kyle,[glances at the rabbis again] I don't speak Hebrew. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77840,Kyle,He said they come on urgent business. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77843,Kyle,"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77848,Kyle,It's right over here by uh- 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77852,Kyle,He said the Muslims beat them here- [to himself] God damn it! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77855,Kyle,Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a- 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77859,Kyle,"[trying to reach Cartman, but trapped by the crowd] Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77861,Kyle,NOOOO! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77881,Kyle,Yeah. [Cartman enters and Kyle closes the door] 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77883,Kyle,No shit! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77885,Kyle,Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77887,Kyle,"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don't you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77889,Kyle,"Dude, go to Hell! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77891,Kyle,Wwwait. [Cartman stops] 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77893,Kyle,Mom? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77895,Kyle,"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77897,Kyle,"[looks down and to his right] You're a fat skank, Mom. [shuts his eyes. Sheila is shocked] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77899,Kyle,"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. [turns and walks out. Cartman's jaw drops.] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77904,Kyle,I just... thought it'd be nice. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77906,Kyle,Yes sir. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77908,Kyle,"Yes. [sets Cartman's books and backpack on the floor, then walks to the middle of the hallway] I love Cartman's farts. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77910,Kyle,Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77912,Kyle,Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77914,Kyle,Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77916,Kyle,[stands up] Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. [turns around and walks away. Cartman smiles. Stan and Kenny can't believe it] 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77920,Kyle,"[opens the door and walks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77922,Kyle,"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77924,Kyle,[rubs his tears away] Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it. [Cartman sneaks a peek around the open door] I love it sooo sooo much. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77926,Kyle,"Because they taste so yummy. [his voice quivers, Cartman giggles from behind the door] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77929,Kyle,Not if you... have some delicious farts for me. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77931,Kyle,Please... 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77933,Kyle,Yummy yummy. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77945,Kyle,Hey 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77947,Kyle,"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77949,Kyle,"[gets emotional] I just do, Stan. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77951,Kyle,Yes. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77953,Kyle,Yes. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77955,Kyle,NO. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77957,Kyle,This is Cartman. I have to take it. [answers his phone] Hello? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77959,Kyle,[keeping quite calm] I don't care. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77961,Kyle,That's fine. [hangs up] 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77963,Kyle,"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77969,Kyle,"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. [begins to reject Cartman's farts in his dreams. A bright light appears and Kyle wakes up, then looks at the foot of his bed] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77971,Kyle,Huh? Who...? Who is that? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77973,Kyle,I... because the world is at peace. I must endure. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77975,Kyle,I... I know. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77977,Kyle,"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77979,Kyle,Yes. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77981,Kyle,I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77986,Kyle,Yes! Yes I will! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77988,Kyle,"Yes, whatever you want. [a longer fart] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77992,Kyle,"[dressed in gray pants and white tunic, no footwear] It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. [walks away, screen left] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77996,Kyle,"Hello, Stan. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77998,Kyle,There are greater things at work than what you understand. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78000,Kyle,I'm actually the complete opposite. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78002,Kyle,"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78004,Kyle,[thinks a bit] I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78006,Kyle,"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78014,Kyle,Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78016,Kyle,Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78021,Kyle,Dude! Do not do this! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78023,Kyle,"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78026,Kyle,"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78028,Kyle,"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78030,Kyle,"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78032,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kenny! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78036,Kyle,Hurray! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78047,Kyle,"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78049,Kyle,Yes! It did! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78051,Kyle,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78053,Kyle,But it's the truth! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78056,Kyle,Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing. 
17,7,Black Friday,78094,Kyle,Larry and Brad Stoltsky 
17,7,Black Friday,78115,Kyle,Those XBox Ones are as good as ours! 
17,7,Black Friday,78123,Kyle,Yeah. 
17,7,Black Friday,78125,Kyle,"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system. "
17,7,Black Friday,78127,Kyle,"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine. "
17,7,Black Friday,78129,Kyle,"[taken aback] No, the XBox's are gonna be better. "
17,7,Black Friday,78138,Kyle,"No! We can't divide like this! [Stan leaves the XBox group] Stan? [Stan turns around] You're on our side, right? "
17,7,Black Friday,78140,Kyle,"[stunned, then] Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One. "
17,7,Black Friday,78142,Kyle,[determined] Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday. 
17,7,Black Friday,78144,Kyle,I know. 
17,7,Black Friday,78171,Kyle,I don't know. 
17,7,Black Friday,78176,Kyle,"This isn't helping us, Butters! "
17,7,Black Friday,78269,Kyle,"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78301,Kyle,"[catches up to Cartman] Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78303,Kyle,"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78305,Kyle,"Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78405,Kyle,"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78407,Kyle,Grounded? For what? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78409,Kyle,"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78411,Kyle,What? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78455,Kyle,"[steps forward] Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78457,Kyle,All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78550,Kyle,"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78554,Kyle,This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78556,Kyle,"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78558,Kyle,"I have an idea. [turns around and walks off a bit] I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78578,Kyle,"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78583,Kyle,"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78586,Kyle,"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78588,Kyle,"Let's do this together, dude. [Stan turns around and goes back] Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78590,Kyle,"[pledges with his right hand up and puts his left hand behind his back] I swear, Stan. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78657,Kyle,"[rushes up] Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78659,Kyle,Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78661,Kyle,[getting alarmed] What the hell did you do?? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78663,Kyle,No. Tell me you didn't! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78666,Kyle,"Thanks, Mrs. Marsh. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78668,Kyle,"Ok-okay. [watches her leave, walks over to Stan's door and knocks] Stan? Stan? "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78670,Kyle,"Stan, it's me. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78672,Kyle,"Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78674,Kyle,"You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78676,Kyle,You didn't? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78678,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78680,Kyle,"[lets his head fall on the door] Stan, don't say that. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78717,Kyle,"[approaches Cartman and Kenny's table] Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! [the PS4 soldiers immediately brandish their weapons and aim them at the XBox soldiers. Tweek advances on Tolkien with an armed bow. Kenny has his sword under Cartman's chin] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78719,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78721,Kyle,"I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78723,Kyle,"The fight is over, Cartman! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78728,Kyle,Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78730,Kyle,No. They're not a part of your betrayal? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78733,Kyle,Stan? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78778,Kyle,"Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78956,Kyle,Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79028,Kyle,Barking vaginal belch. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79035,Kyle,Bloody butt cough. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79047,Kyle,How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79053,Kyle,It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79060,Kyle,"Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79068,Kyle,What?! Tell us! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79070,Kyle,Washington Redskins? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79076,Kyle,What?! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79078,Kyle,"Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79082,Kyle,"Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79084,Kyle,"Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79086,Kyle,I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79093,Kyle,No way! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79128,Kyle,"[enters with Stan] Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79130,Kyle,People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79132,Kyle,That's the Catholic Church! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79134,Kyle,That's the NFL! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79137,Kyle,"All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79139,Kyle,Maybe I'll start my own company. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79141,Kyle,I don't want to! It's a stupid name! [eerie music plays for a few seconds] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79143,Kyle,Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79177,Kyle,"It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79179,Kyle,"You okay, bro? "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79181,Kyle,"Give it time, it'll grow on you. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79183,Kyle,"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79185,Kyle,Well whattaya mean? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79187,Kyle,"Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back. [Stan slowly walks to the door, then turns around] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79189,Kyle,Yeah. Good luck with yours. [Stan leaves and closes the door] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79211,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. [Cartman barges in with Butters and Kenny in tow] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79213,Kyle,What?! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79215,Kyle,"No, I just can't get it to load. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79217,Kyle,My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79220,Kyle,He's right. We should do a merger. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79222,Kyle,"Yes we do! We have a sweet name. [Cartman turns around] I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79226,Kyle,"Whattaya say, Cartman? "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79229,Kyle,"[joins Cartman onstage] When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself. [The modified Redskin logo fades to a single line saying ""GO FUND YOURSELF""] And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79264,Kyle,What the heck is that? [the boys leave the building to investigate] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79269,Kyle,Change our name? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79272,Kyle,When was that? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79278,Kyle,Well what the hell do we do? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79281,Kyle,Hey guys! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79284,Kyle,"Sup, Jason? [Jason turns and walks away angrily] "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79290,Kyle,"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79294,Kyle,We were- trying to be funny. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79309,Kyle,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79311,Kyle,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79334,Kyle,I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79339,Kyle,"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79341,Kyle,"[joins him on the floor] Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79345,Kyle,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79347,Kyle,"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79355,Kyle,"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79365,Kyle,"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79417,Kyle,Hey Cartman. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79419,Kyle,"Dude, calm down. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79421,Kyle,Who took all the pizza and the cake? [begins to notice flickering lights outside his window and hears an approaching crowd. All the gluten-tainted food that people have been bagging is being thrown into a bonfire] What the hell? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79436,Kyle,"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79440,Kyle,"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79443,Kyle,"Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79531,Kyle,"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79541,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, dude. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79548,Kyle,Cartman? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79574,Kyle,"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79576,Kyle,"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. [Scott walks away] "
18,3,The Cissy,79594,Kyle,"Are you okay, Cartman? "
18,3,The Cissy,79605,Kyle," [from inside] Then don't eat 14 Eggo waffles for lunch, fatass! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80159,Kyle,"Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80168,Kyle,"That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80170,Kyle,Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80176,Kyle,That's terrible! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80215,Kyle,Are you happy now?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80217,Kyle,"Is, is this? Do you think this is cool? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80219,Kyle,"See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80221,Kyle,"I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman! [another drone floats by in the background] I know what- "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80223,Kyle,I was in the bathroom- 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80225,Kyle,"No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80227,Kyle,How is that spying?! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80347,Kyle,"[turns to face him] Hey, Jimmy. What's up? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80349,Kyle,Oh. Really? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80351,Kyle,"[considers it for a moment] Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80357,Kyle,What? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80360,Kyle,This is stupid! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80364,Kyle,It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80368,Kyle,Who makes this crap? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80419,Kyle,You... missed school today? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80421,Kyle,Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80425,Kyle,You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80429,Kyle,"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80431,Kyle,"Kenny, who told you about this game? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80433,Kyle,"Dude, what?! "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80442,Kyle,"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80444,Kyle,"[walks up to him] Dude, what are you doing?! "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80446,Kyle,You need to stop recommending that app to people! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80451,Kyle,"[crosses his arms] Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?! "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80453,Kyle,You just push it on other people?! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80455,Kyle,"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?! "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80487,Kyle,But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80491,Kyle,You have your crutches! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80494,Kyle,You're saying these games do this on purpose?! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80512,Kyle,"Sure. Come on, guys. [he, Cartman and Kyle walk away] "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80519,Kyle,"[brainstorming] We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then- "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80521,Kyle,"Wuh, what's done? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80595,Kyle,Hey dude. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80597,Kyle,Y-you alright? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80644,Kyle,"Coup de grah, Cartman "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80735,Kyle,"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80742,Kyle,"You should probably listen to him, dude. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80746,Kyle,[glances at Stan and Kenny] Maybe we are. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80772,Kyle,[answers] Hello? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80774,Kyle,Again? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80776,Kyle,Uh huh. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80778,Kyle,"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80785,Kyle,You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80787,Kyle,[slowly] Fuck you! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80789,Kyle,"Get up, Cartman! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80791,Kyle,"Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso?! [shakes Cartman's chair] You're goin' to the hospital! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80793,Kyle,"[looks back at Stan, then turns around to face him] Fuck you if you're in on this. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80797,Kyle,"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80799,Kyle,"Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80801,Kyle,Kyle. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80803,Kyle,I don't care! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80805,Kyle,You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80807,Kyle,"[rolls his eyes, then slowly] Fuck you! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80809,Kyle,He said they're doing a Total Recall. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80812,Kyle,You haven't done anything yet! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80814,Kyle,We need help! Our friend is in a coma! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80819,Kyle,"Hey, Cartman, I need to talk to you. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80821,Kyle,"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80823,Kyle,"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80825,Kyle,"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80827,Kyle,"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80829,Kyle,Www-what do you mean? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80831,Kyle,Fuck you! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80833,Kyle,Don't... do that! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80835,Kyle,"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to- "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80837,Kyle,No. Then I came into this virtual space. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80839,Kyle,Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80843,Kyle,Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80845,Kyle,"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80848,Kyle,[stunned at the familiar voice] Dude... What? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80858,Kyle,"Wait. Stan? [walks up to Stan] Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80860,Kyle,"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then- "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80862,Kyle,Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80866,Kyle,God damn it Cartman! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80868,Kyle,He's lying. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80893,Kyle,Why not? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80895,Kyle,Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80916,Kyle,[from a walkie-talkie] We're right here dude. Do you remember now? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80930,Kyle,"We're here, dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80933,Kyle,"Alright, dude, take off the headset. [Stan reaches up and removes the headset. At this point the animation switches to live-action. Stan finishes taking off the headset as Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny watch] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80934,Kyle,"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus? "
18,8,Cock Magic,80946,Kyle,But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight. 
18,8,Cock Magic,80952,Kyle,Can Kenny block his Elderbeast? 
18,8,Cock Magic,80964,Kyle,He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade! 
18,8,Cock Magic,80972,Kyle,You've never seen anything so ruthless! 
18,8,Cock Magic,80988,Kyle,"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80990,Kyle,It doesn't even look like they're open. [tugs and knocks at the doors] 
18,8,Cock Magic,81010,Kyle,It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81020,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe that's just kind of what they do naturally. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81026,Kyle,"Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81040,Kyle,You were? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81049,Kyle,"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81051,Kyle,We don't... really know the difference. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81062,Kyle,Then he's perfect for us. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81064,Kyle,Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81084,Kyle,"You can do it, McNuggets! [the crowd argues around them] "
18,8,Cock Magic,81091,Kyle,"All right, McNuggets! [after the fights the boys leave City Wok] Did we pick the right rooster or what?! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81096,Kyle,You mean there's more to this? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81114,Kyle,It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81117,Kyle,"Yeah, you gotta know people. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81145,Kyle,This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81158,Kyle,McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81164,Kyle,"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81175,Kyle,"Come on, Kenny! [Kenny takes a card from a deck and looks through his other cards] "
18,8,Cock Magic,81179,Kyle,He just had to shuffle it. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81185,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81204,Kyle,"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81207,Kyle,"Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81209,Kyle,Got what? 
18,9,REHASH,81215,Kyle,"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together. "
18,9,REHASH,81217,Kyle,"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship. "
18,9,REHASH,81219,Kyle,Yes! [runs upstairs smiling.] 
18,9,REHASH,81221,Kyle,Heeey Ike! Look what I got. [Ike looks over his shoulder] The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play? 
18,9,REHASH,81224,Kyle,"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving! "
18,9,REHASH,81226,Kyle,[walks up to Ike] Well what are you watching? 
18,9,REHASH,81228,Kyle,You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it? 
18,9,REHASH,81231,Kyle,"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it? "
18,9,REHASH,81236,Kyle,"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days. "
18,9,REHASH,81238,Kyle,"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame. "
18,9,REHASH,81240,Kyle,"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit! "
18,9,REHASH,81256,Kyle,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people. 
18,9,REHASH,81258,Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary. "
18,9,REHASH,81260,Kyle,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! [Cartman eyes his phone with Stan and Kenny look at Kyle] "
18,9,REHASH,81263,Kyle,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people. 
18,9,REHASH,81267,Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. "
18,9,REHASH,81270,Kyle,Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l- 
18,9,REHASH,81288,Kyle,"[goes into the room] Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me? "
18,9,REHASH,81290,Kyle,"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things! "
18,9,REHASH,81291,Kyle,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people. 
18,9,REHASH,81293,Kyle,[approaches the monitor] What the fuck?! 
18,9,REHASH,81296,Kyle,"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room! "
18,9,REHASH,81298,Kyle,But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity? 
18,9,REHASH,81301,Kyle,What do you think you're doing?! 
18,9,REHASH,81303,Kyle,You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?! 
18,9,REHASH,81305,Kyle,I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything! 
18,9,REHASH,81307,Kyle,This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room! 
18,9,REHASH,81309,Kyle,"""Let's Plays""? "
18,9,REHASH,81329,Kyle,You're not gonna believe this. 
18,9,REHASH,81331,Kyle,"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition. "
18,9,REHASH,81333,Kyle,Come on! [leads Stan upstairs] 
18,9,REHASH,81336,Kyle,See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age. 
18,9,REHASH,81339,Kyle,And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age. 
18,9,REHASH,81346,Kyle,"This is how they talk to us! [to Conner] You'd better watch your mouth, kid! "
18,9,REHASH,81392,Kyle,It's dying. The living room is... dying. 
18,9,REHASH,81434,Kyle,I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy. 
18,9,REHASH,81437,Kyle,"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV. "
18,9,REHASH,81439,Kyle,[notices the commenter window above the bus stop sign] Do you mind?! 
18,9,REHASH,81441,Kyle,Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things! 
18,9,REHASH,81456,Kyle,"[walks up to the front of the class and turns around. He reads from a sheet of paper] What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and- "
18,9,REHASH,81459,Kyle,It's Cartman's stupid online persona! 
18,9,REHASH,81466,Kyle,There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart- 
18,9,REHASH,81468,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop! "
18,9,REHASH,81470,Kyle,THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81494,Kyle," It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending. Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.  [leaves the menorah and stops by Ike's room, and looks in]  This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued: What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.  [Ike is watching ""Dragon Age: Inquisition"" on his computer while eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos]   "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81496,Kyle," Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast. Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.  [Kyle looks at the floor, turns back and walks away. he stops by the kitchen, then by his dad's study. Gerald takes a selfie with his pet project: a model of a ship]  Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying, All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.  [he walks through the living room, then stops and looks around]  Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski, [he looks at the TV and walks up to it]  What brought families together most was a good old TV [he walks through the park with his head down]  Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw. [he sees a little girl on a bench looking at her iPhone]  And if you try to complain, you get called a-   "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81498,Kyle,I'm NOT a GRANDPA! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81499,Kyle,"[Now at his own desk]  But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon. [The following is the tweet]  The more connected we get, the more alone we become. If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom, Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom  [finishes the tweet but doesn't submit it yet. He's wearing a tee shirt with #savethelivingroom on it]   "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81500,Kyle,Whattaya think? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81502,Kyle,Really?? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81504,Kyle,"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome."" "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81506,Kyle,"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81508,Kyle,Bill Cosby. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81510,Kyle,Is here. To see me. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81514,Kyle,Hello. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81516,Kyle,We? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81518,Kyle,Wow. [smiles] Well that's awesome! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81520,Kyle,"M-Ah, I'd love to. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81522,Kyle,Uh okay! No problem! [Bill lets himself out] 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81524,Kyle,"Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81549,Kyle,"[excitedly] Dude, what are you doing?! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81551,Kyle,"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81553,Kyle,"These producers making a big holiday special! [goes to the TV and wipes it clean] They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81555,Kyle,"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81562,Kyle,"Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81566,Kyle,That son of a bitch! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81568,Kyle,Why would he do this?! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81570,Kyle,"Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81607,Kyle,Mom?! Where is Ike?! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81609,Kyle,That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81613,Kyle,"Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81619,Kyle,WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81640,Kyle,"Cartman, open this door right now! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81642,Kyle,What the hell are you doing?! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81644,Kyle,Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81646,Kyle,"Because you just said, ""here in my room""! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81652,Kyle,"What are you talking about, Stan? "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81655,Kyle,"Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81657,Kyle,I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81684,Kyle,"[walks into the restaurant and towards the producer with Stan] Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81720,Kyle,How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81760,Kyle,I am so confused. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81769,Kyle,"[thinking aloud] Everyone is watching everything. [turns right and walks up to a camera] Ike? [switch to Ike's room] Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa. [Ike's friends look at the monitor] I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did. [Michael's hologram walks up to the record producer and shoots him in the head, killing him] I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81775,Kyle,Help? How can you help? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81778,Kyle,Really? That's what you guys would do? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81780,Kyle,"Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81782,Kyle,[walks ever closer to the camera] You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! [the signal is now disrupted] 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81787,Kyle,PewDiePie?! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81802,Kyle,"Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81804,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81806,Kyle,"No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here. [notices PewDiePie's commenter window pop up to his right and above] And I, think that's great. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81829,Kyle,You know what? I think it's good. Let's face it: this is long overdue. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81833,Kyle,Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter and I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81892,Kyle,"Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81895,Kyle,"Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81903,Kyle,"[walks up to Cartman] You're Tom Brady, Cartman! And that new principal in there is the football commissioner trying to dictate his punishment to you. And what happens when an invulnerable cheater comes up against an elitist corporate dictator? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81913,Kyle,"Cool. I think we did it. [raises his left arm, and Stan high-fives it] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81964,Kyle,"Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81967,Kyle,Why? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81969,Kyle,"No, you're a bigot. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81971,Kyle,"I'm not going to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero! In fact, personally, I think she's most likely not a very good person! [the boys gasp] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81973,Kyle,"Come on, fat-ass. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81975,Kyle,So you're never gonna call me a dirty Jew again? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81977,Kyle,Oh fuck you. [turns around and walks out] 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81992,Kyle,"AAAAHH! What the fuck, dude?! What the fuck?! [A few seconds later the men rush out of the room as he watches them leave. Then he looks down and sees pigs all over the floor. Each one has the word ""Biggit"" painted on.] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82014,Kyle,Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82016,Kyle,"[steps inside, tree and all] Your dad was on my lawn yelling at me all night, and after I finally fell asleep I woke up Saran-wrapped to a tree with penises on my face. And this. [removes his hat to reveal his hair gathered into four crude ponytails, one of them covered in a condom. Stan is stunned, but takes it in] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82022,Kyle,"I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82025,Kyle,"HER, yes! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82057,Kyle,"Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP! [The camera shows his head bigger than usual and the air brighter then usual. His voice echoes across town and everyone stops in their tracks. A pregnant woman picks up a taco and runs off with it.] This is so wrong! I can't let it continue! This is not ever what I intended! I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There's no other way to say it. What she did took bravery, and she is absolutely stunning. [Moments later, PC Principal steps forward and begins clapping. Once the clapping reaches normal speed, others begin to join in. A live-action shot of Brett Farve at the ESPYs ""limp-clapping"" is even thrown in] "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82068,Kyle,"It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82111,Kyle,[annoyed] I'm sitting right here. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82113,Kyle,You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?! 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82115,Kyle,"[looks at Stan, betrayed] What?! "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82118,Kyle,I didn't even want to give that speech! 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82122,Kyle,Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82124,Kyle,"You guys, immigrants, either legal or illegal, are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living- "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82157,Kyle,"Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with a little- "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82298,Kyle,"[gets up on stage to clear his name] Hold on, wait! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who brought the Canadians here! It was something just like this. Don't you see? If there's anything we've learned, it's that we have to stop this kind of sensationalist politics before the same thing happens to us, because if we let this kind of... [stops himself] this... kind of... [the crowd looks at him, annoyed] "
19,3,The City Part of Town,82308,Kyle,I can't believe Jimmy Fallon hates us. Jimmy Fallon loves everything. Why would he slam our whole town? 
19,3,The City Part of Town,82466,Kyle,Shhhh. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82530,Kyle,"So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82532,Kyle,Davíd is new to our school. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82534,Kyle,Shut up. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82538,Kyle,It's not supposed to have water you-! 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82563,Kyle,Are you joking?! 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82569,Kyle,He's not important. At. All. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82575,Kyle,"Ah, [facepalm] don't, dude, dude- Don't. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82605,Kyle,[arriving] You haven't heard? Nobody gives a fuck what Yelp reviewers think anymore. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82608,Kyle,['HA! [walks off as well confidently] ']
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82659,Kyle,We all... loved... Whistlin' Willy's! 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82663,Kyle,Nobody went for the fucking food! 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82666,Kyle,[gets in Cartman's face] You're done! [turns around and walks away with the remaining boys] 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82683,Kyle,"David! Dude, wait! [Kyle is next to him now] Dude, you don't wanna do this. You don't know what Cartman's capable of. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82685,Kyle,But this isn't Mexico. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82688,Kyle,"Alright, you've got your army! You've got your followers! If you're such a great leader, then just tell the city what you want, fat-ass! "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82698,Kyle,[after a few moments] Every person here thinks this is about them. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82700,Kyle,Yeah. Me too. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82705,Kyle,"Okay, bring in the next one. "
19,5,Safe Space,82796,Kyle,Uh huh. 
19,5,Safe Space,82798,Kyle,Yeah probably. 
19,5,Safe Space,82800,Kyle,"Wait, what? "
19,5,Safe Space,82802,Kyle,You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp account and only give him the good comments? 
19,5,Safe Space,82804,Kyle,No. 
19,5,Safe Space,82806,Kyle,"If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off. [Cartman begins to cry] "
19,5,Safe Space,82808,Kyle,"[a bit stunned, considers his options] Give me... give me detention. "
19,5,Safe Space,82810,Kyle,"Yeah, I'll take the detention. "
19,5,Safe Space,82972,Kyle,There's more than two people on the Internet. 
19,5,Safe Space,82974,Kyle,"[turns him around] Butters, what are you doing?! [the other student leaves] "
19,5,Safe Space,82976,Kyle,"Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it! "
19,5,Safe Space,82983,Kyle,"Butters, listen to my voice. "
19,5,Safe Space,82985,Kyle,"Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83027,Kyle,"[questioning, seeking confirmation] No. We would know. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83115,Kyle,Yeah? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83118,Kyle,What? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83189,Kyle,"No, dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83191,Kyle,"I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83343,Kyle,What? 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83345,Kyle,You're lying. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83347,Kyle,How is that gay? 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83376,Kyle,You're talking to Kyle right now. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83378,Kyle,You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem? 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83473,Kyle,I'm right here. [standing between Tolkien and Stan] 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83492,Kyle,"Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig! "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83498,Kyle,Oh shit! 
19,8,Sponsored Content,83543,Kyle,"Oh Jesus, now what? "
19,8,Sponsored Content,83545,Kyle,"Was what me, sir? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83780,Kyle,What? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83783,Kyle,Knock it off! 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83785,Kyle,"Go get my pen, fatass "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83787,Kyle,Go get my pen! 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83791,Kyle,Goddammit! [leaves his seat] 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83795,Kyle,Where's PC Principal? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83797,Kyle,What are you talking about? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83827,Kyle,"""Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-"" what the hell is this? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83829,Kyle,Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83831,Kyle,I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83838,Kyle,Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83888,Kyle,There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83890,Kyle,"Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83893,Kyle,I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal. [his computer is recording the conversation] Where did you say PC Principal was from? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83895,Kyle,Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about- [an ad for a Vermont vacation pops up] Goddammit what the hell is this? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83898,Kyle,"Dude. Dude, look at this. ""How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-"" [a popup ad for a guitar appears] Dude there it is again! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83900,Kyle,It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me! 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83902,Kyle,I'm trying! Goddammit get over here! 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83904,Kyle,"[looks at Stan] It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83906,Kyle,"It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83910,Kyle,"[click] OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. [a popup ad for Fun Cream ice cream appears] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83914,Kyle,So then what'd Tolkien say? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83919,Kyle,"Whoa, what the hell just happened? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83963,Kyle,We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83966,Kyle,It's like... someone's trying to... distract us. [looks suspiciously at Stan] Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83968,Kyle,Why are you looking at me? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84021,Kyle,Well what are you guys talking about? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84024,Kyle,What?! 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84026,Kyle,"And why do you think that, Stan?! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84028,Kyle,"Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84032,Kyle,"It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84035,Kyle,"N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84074,Kyle,Leslie. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84076,Kyle,How do you know thi-? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84078,Kyle,"2692 [They shake hands, and he leaves the house with her] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84090,Kyle,Butters. [Butters' smile vanishes] Get to the bathroom. Now. [Butters is a bit alarmed] 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84093,Kyle,Jimmy's dead. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84095,Kyle,"I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84097,Kyle,PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84099,Kyle,Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84101,Kyle,It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84103,Kyle,I think it's obvious. Stan's dad. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84105,Kyle,"Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84107,Kyle,There's no way to know who we can trust. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84109,Kyle,There's only one thing we can do. [turns around] We have to get guns. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84111,Kyle,It's the only way for us to be safe. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84117,Kyle,You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84212,Kyle,Are you okay? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84214,Kyle,Here. [holds her hands to warm them up] 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84216,Kyle,"Don't worry, Leslie. I won't let anything happen to you. [smiles back and blinks] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84258,Kyle,"Leslie, we don't know who is on their side. We have to stay safe. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84260,Kyle,I... [turns aside and walks off] gave up giving speeches. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84262,Kyle,I'm sure I'd have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84264,Kyle,Not if we go somewhere that's completely safe from any violence. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84266,Kyle,The gun show. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84268,Kyle,There'll be so many guns that nothing bad can happen. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84319,Kyle,[enters the arena at the far end with Leslie] Don't listen to them! The real conspiracy here are the PC extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesn't think like they do! [faces Stan] You son of a bitch Stan! How could you have sided with the enemy?! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84322,Kyle,Jimmy? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84331,Kyle,You told me Jimmy was dead. 
20,1,Member Berries,84458,Kyle,"I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible? "
20,1,Member Berries,84460,Kyle,"But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does? "
20,1,Member Berries,84462,Kyle,I don't think the answer to all this is member berries. 
20,1,Member Berries,84464,Kyle,"Agh, never mind. I'm just gonna stay out of it. [gets up and leaves the office. A few seconds later, Mr. Mackey opens a drawer in his desk and pulls out a mason jar with member berries in it. He opens the jar and lifts the berries out] "
20,1,Member Berries,84489,Kyle,What the hell are you doing?! 
20,1,Member Berries,84491,Kyle,You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night! 
20,1,Member Berries,84493,Kyle,"I don't really care! Just don't drag me into it! [takes Cartman's book and slams it down on the floor, then walks away angrily] "
20,1,Member Berries,84519,Kyle,Goddammit! [takes the phone from Butters] Do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel?! 
20,1,Member Berries,84521,Kyle,"We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us! "
20,1,Member Berries,84527,Kyle,[flatly] I didn't know vagina had balls. 
20,1,Member Berries,84529,Kyle,"You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?! "
20,1,Member Berries,84531,Kyle,"It's not gonna work, Cartman! I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore! when this whole thing comes to an end, you're gonna be all on your own! [walks away] "
20,1,Member Berries,84554,Kyle,Yeah? 
20,1,Member Berries,84556,Kyle,What are you doing here?? 
20,1,Member Berries,84558,Kyle,I'm going to the bathroom! 
20,1,Member Berries,84560,Kyle,"[finishes up and hops off the toilet, pulling his pants up] They sat it out because you were harassing them online. "
20,1,Member Berries,84562,Kyle,Why would you care?! 
20,1,Member Berries,84564,Kyle,"If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?! "
20,1,Member Berries,84566,Kyle,"Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said! "
20,1,Member Berries,84583,Kyle,Yeah Dad. Just thinkin'. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84602,Kyle,"Dude, what's going on? "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84604,Kyle,Hear what? What happened? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84606,Kyle,"Oh no. [Heidi walks past them, looking down.] "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84608,Kyle,She'll get back on. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84663,Kyle,The girls want to see Cartman punished so we have to prove it's him. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84671,Kyle,"Yeah, but not like we'd actually do it. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84673,Kyle,Stan... You can't be thinking that we'd- 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84677,Kyle,Are we seriously talking about doing this? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84717,Kyle,We're almost there. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84756,Kyle,Just put your stuff on the table and step back.  
20,2,Skank Hunt,84770,Kyle,What we had to do. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84799,Kyle,What's going on? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84801,Kyle,Hear what? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84803,Kyle,"No, that's impossible! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84805,Kyle,Oh my God. Oh my God... 
20,3,The Damned,84842,Kyle,"[panics a bit] No. Uh, he quit. "
20,3,The Damned,84844,Kyle,He probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it. [shrugs] I don't know. 
20,3,The Damned,84849,Kyle,"Okay, that was the cops! The cops were here! "
20,3,The Damned,84853,Kyle,But we were wrong! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85017,Kyle,"Dad, can I talk to you? "
20,4,Wieners Out,85019,Kyle,"All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85021,Kyle,"Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85023,Kyle,"I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that? "
20,4,Wieners Out,85062,Kyle,"[talks while pacing back and forth] Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85064,Kyle,I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change. [stops pacing] 
20,4,Wieners Out,85066,Kyle,Butters? 
20,4,Wieners Out,85068,Kyle,"Butters, you need to calm down. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85091,Kyle,"Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85094,Kyle,This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85101,Kyle,Oh [hits his face] no! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85160,Kyle,"Everyone all right, guys? "
20,4,Wieners Out,85190,Kyle,[walks behind Ike and gets shocked by Gerald and Sheila's actions] 
20,4,Wieners Out,85192,Kyle,"Hi, Cartman. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85194,Kyle,"I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85196,Kyle,No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us. 
20,4,Wieners Out,85198,Kyle,What?! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85200,Kyle,You saw who's vagina? 
20,4,Wieners Out,85202,Kyle,"[lays his hand on his forehead] Yeah right, okay. [lowers his hand] I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85211,Kyle,"[in complete shock] The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are... "
20,4,Wieners Out,85215,Kyle,[pauses in complete shock] 
20,4,Wieners Out,85227,Kyle,[starts to get bored] 
20,4,Wieners Out,85230,Kyle,"Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger? "
20,4,Wieners Out,85232,Kyle,You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85236,Kyle,That's not true at all! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85268,Kyle,"[shouts] Everyone, can I have your attention please?! [everyone has his attention] I know the past few weeks have been very difficult, for all of us. I know now more than ever that something has to change. I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would have see. These are all complex issues we're all having to face, and now that I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer. [pulls off his pants, holds his shirt, and raises his arm] "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85480,Kyle,I have a fundraiser at school. 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85482,Kyle,What? 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85505,Kyle,[arriving] It's true. Denmark got trolled last night. They left social media. 
20,6,Fort Collins,85598,Kyle,[tilts head up] Yeah. 
20,6,Fort Collins,85600,Kyle,"Oh, what do you want now?! "
20,6,Fort Collins,85602,Kyle,Hurry up! 
20,6,Fort Collins,85604,Kyle,"Ah! Dude, what the fuck? "
20,6,Fort Collins,85606,Kyle,I'm going to the bathroom! 
20,6,Fort Collins,85608,Kyle,Why? 
20,6,Fort Collins,85610,Kyle,"[looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85624,Kyle,What is? 
20,6,Fort Collins,85629,Kyle,What is all this? 
20,6,Fort Collins,85631,Kyle,"Wow, that's pretty smart. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85634,Kyle,You mean like one of the teachers? 
20,6,Fort Collins,85636,Kyle,Are you sure? 
20,6,Fort Collins,85638,Kyle,"Emoji analysis, it's genius! "
20,6,Fort Collins,85666,Kyle,She wasn't being funny. 
20,6,Fort Collins,85668,Kyle,I don't! 
20,6,Fort Collins,85670,Kyle,"Cartman, [leaves his chair] I did some research on the Danish Web site you've been helping out. You do realize that once TrollTrace is online, anybody can use it on anyone, right? "
20,6,Fort Collins,85672,Kyle,"So somebody, like Heidi, could use it to see your entire Internet history. Everything you ever said and did on the Internet, even before you were together. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85674,Kyle,"Right, but somebody, like me, could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there's some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about. "
20,6,Fort Collins,85681,Kyle,"It's available to everyone, stupid! "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85846,Kyle,"Dad, what the? "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85904,Kyle,Dad! [runs into Ike's room] Where are you? 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85906,Kyle,"Dad, what's going on? Mom is freaking out. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85908,Kyle,"No, Dad, I need you back home. Please, I-I'm so confused right now. "
20,8,Members Only,86296,Kyle,"Ike? [Ike looks back at Kyle, then puts his head on the wall again] What are you doing? "
20,8,Members Only,86298,Kyle,Well what'd he do? 
20,8,Members Only,86300,Kyle,What? 
20,8,Members Only,86302,Kyle,You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...? 
20,8,Members Only,86309,Kyle,"[stops thinking back] Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! [grabs Ike's hand and rushes out the front door with him. Sheila hears the front door open and looks around for her boys. She reaches the open front door] "
20,9,Not Funny,86327,Kyle,"I just felt bad for him, ma. "
20,9,Not Funny,86331,Kyle,[goes in front of the computer] Hi dad. 
20,9,Not Funny,86333,Kyle,"It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble. "
20,9,Not Funny,86335,Kyle,Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you. 
20,9,Not Funny,86337,Kyle,[talks softly] Why dad? Why did you do this? 
20,9,Not Funny,86339,Kyle,Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?! 
20,9,Not Funny,86341,Kyle,How?! 
20,9,Not Funny,86381,Kyle,"[enters with Ike] What are you all doing?! [walks closer to the priest] Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies? "
20,9,Not Funny,86383,Kyle,"Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it. "
20,9,Not Funny,86385,Kyle,[stands on a step near Maxi] Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are. 
20,9,Not Funny,86388,Kyle,"You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action. "
20,9,Not Funny,86418,Kyle,Alright! 
20,9,Not Funny,86433,Kyle,"Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent. "
20,9,Not Funny,86435,Kyle,The President stated that since then... 
20,9,Not Funny,86439,Kyle,"Ma, we were just using it to look at the news. "
20,9,Not Funny,86441,Kyle,"I'm not against you, mom. "
20,9,Not Funny,86446,Kyle,What is dad doing in Denmark?! 
20,9,Not Funny,86491,Kyle,"[in his bedroom, with Ike] Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark! "
20,9,Not Funny,86493,Kyle,It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war. 
20,9,Not Funny,86495,Kyle,[Looks at phone in shock and then thinks of an answer] I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet. 
20,9,Not Funny,86497,Kyle,Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass. 
20,9,Not Funny,86499,Kyle,Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing. 
20,9,Not Funny,86501,Kyle,You're a little dipshit president. 
20,9,Not Funny,86503,Kyle,With a dirty asshole. 
20,9,Not Funny,86505,Kyle,And you shit out your dick. [covers phone with hand and looks at Ike] Where did you learn to talk like this? 
20,9,Not Funny,86508,Kyle,"Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch. "
20,9,Not Funny,86558,Kyle,"[standing in the hallway] Ike...It's time. [walks up to Ike] I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now. "
20,9,Not Funny,86560,Kyle,"Just remember--I always loved you, little brother. "
20,9,Not Funny,86562,Kyle,Let's...just get this over with. 
20,9,Not Funny,86570,Kyle,He's in the pantry. 
20,9,Not Funny,86572,Kyle,"Ma. Mom, we are really sorry... "
20,9,Not Funny,86574,Kyle,But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers. 
20,9,Not Funny,86576,Kyle,"We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86586,Kyle,"Okay, okay, Tolkien? Tolkien are you there? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86589,Kyle,"I can't tell you dude, I just need your Smokin'   help...Please, my life depends Smokin'   on it. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86591,Kyle,"Alright,  I'm not jokin', yeah   I need you to tell me the worst thing I can say on the United Negro College Fund website to piss off black people. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86593,Kyle,"Tolkien, please! There's no time to explain! "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86595,Kyle,That helps thank you. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86597,Kyle,"Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86599,Kyle,"It's not important, just get on it and respond. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86601,Kyle,[To Tweek & Craig.] Hang on. [To Stan.] Stan! Finally. Dude I need everybody online now! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86603,Kyle,"Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go! "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86606,Kyle,"Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86644,Kyle,"All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86649,Kyle,"No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86652,Kyle,Who are you? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86654,Kyle,O-- Okay? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86656,Kyle,"What the hell is ""Trevor's Axiom""? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86759,Kyle,[He throws down headset.] Shit! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86763,Kyle,"Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help-- "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86766,Kyle,"Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86768,Kyle,"No, Mom. You just don't know everything. [Kyle straps a vest around his chest.] "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86770,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86790,Kyle,"Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86792,Kyle,"You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86795,Kyle,"Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now! "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86797,Kyle,Shit! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86799,Kyle,Hold on... 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86802,Kyle,"[Surprised.] Oh, hey, Mr. President "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86804,Kyle,Uh...what do you mean? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86806,Kyle,[Surprised.] It is? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86808,Kyle,[He gives Mr. Garrison a half-hearted military salute.] Thanks? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86833,Kyle,Butters! Where the fuck are you?! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86835,Kyle,SpaceX? Why?! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86837,Kyle,[He swivels his chair around.] Like...how ginormic of an energy source? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86841,Kyle,"Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86879,Kyle,"[He types on his computer.] Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86881,Kyle,"[He types on his computer.] You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86925,Kyle,"Mr. President, do it! "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86987,Kyle,"Yup. Uhh, come on, Ike. "
21,2,Put It Down,87292,Kyle,[wipes away a tear from his laughter] You sound like a dying pig. 
21,2,Put It Down,87359,Kyle,"Yeah dude, he's dead. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87497,Kyle,They what?? 
21,3,Holiday Special,87508,Kyle,Dude! Did you know it's your dad did who's getting the school to cancel Columbus Day? 
21,3,Holiday Special,87510,Kyle,"Well, you've gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87512,Kyle,"Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she's never tried to take away a holiday. I'm your best friend, but I can't have your back when the guys find out about this. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87534,Kyle,"No! No, wait guys. Maybe that's it. When I'm dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and- "
21,3,Holiday Special,87536,Kyle,"I'll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory- "
21,3,Holiday Special,87540,Kyle,Nnnothing. 
21,3,Holiday Special,87542,Kyle,"Stan, can I talk to you for a minute? [leaves the table, and Stan follows] "
21,3,Holiday Special,87587,Kyle,What's he saying? 
21,3,Holiday Special,87619,Kyle,"No dude, that's too far. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87648,Kyle,"Dude, there's nothing we can do, all right? "
21,3,Holiday Special,87652,Kyle,"Come on, guys. [stands up on the merry-go-round] There's something else we can try. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87683,Kyle,[as Stan puts a tape into the VCR] That's why we had it transferred to VHS. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87750,Kyle,Incoming Face Time call from Super Craig. [the boys leave their seats and gather around the monitor] 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87772,Kyle,Butters! Butters! You can't just make stuff up about us! [Butters turns around again] People are thinking it's true! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87774,Kyle,"Dude, what a dick! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87816,Kyle,It's so unfair. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87822,Kyle,"Coon, everybody hates us. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87886,Kyle,"We're here to put an end to you, Chaos! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87917,Kyle,How are we gonna get him to do that? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87934,Kyle,[appeaers and approaches Zuckerberg] Bwa! Dadadadadadadada bam! [punches him in the groin] 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87980,Kyle,Dude you can't do a prequel first. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87982,Kyle,"'Cause then it's not a prequel, it's just... first. And besides, Tupperware isn't our strongest character. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88030,Kyle,"Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88041,Kyle,"Dude, that's really weird. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88048,Kyle,You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa? 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88104,Kyle,[at the downtown corner with Butters] Dude! Did you give Butters a crochet pillow to drop off?! 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88106,Kyle,"Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88145,Kyle,"Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88151,Kyle,"Dude, we're not getting involved! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88154,Kyle,Haww shit! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88371,Kyle,Did any of you guys actually see the witch? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88375,Kyle,They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88380,Kyle,"No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88411,Kyle,"Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88419,Kyle,Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88421,Kyle,OF THE WITCH! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88423,Kyle,Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88425,Kyle,Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88435,Kyle,"[to Gerald] Dad, get out of here! We're trying to deal with an actual witch! Nobody's coming after you! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88473,Kyle,"No, I, I don't know where he is. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88477,Kyle,How are we gonna do that? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88479,Kyle,Who? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88591,Kyle,"That's enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88599,Kyle,I don't get it. I just really don't get it. How is she still supporting him?! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88601,Kyle,But he clearly sucks! She has to know he sucks. What the hell is going on?! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88603,Kyle,It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There's got to be a reason she sticks by him. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88605,Kyle,"[spots her and runs up] Oh Heidi? Heidi, you got a sec? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88607,Kyle,"Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he's doing? Aaas a boyfriend. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88609,Kyle,"Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he's not super-qualified to be with you? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88611,Kyle,"Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88613,Kyle,You don't have to get defensive. I just- 
21,7,Doubling Down,88615,Kyle,"I didn't say ""I... [she whips around again] told you-"" "
21,7,Doubling Down,88617,Kyle,Wooow. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88633,Kyle,"Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won't admit Cartman's a horrible boyfriend. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88635,Kyle,Yeah! It's important. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88650,Kyle,We have to help that girl. Can't you see what's happening? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88652,Kyle,You're wrong. In a way... I think we're all going out with Cartman right now. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88669,Kyle,"Hello. I know things have been difficult between us lately. I know you think all boys are sort of pigs, but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful. [dead air] Not, not like hot-beautiful, I mean like inside-beautiful. I, I'm not saying you're hot. You're not, you're not hot. I'm not saying you're ugly. It doesn't matter- you're all hot on the inside. If we could all just see inside you, it would be hot. [realizes he's out on a limb] Oh, shit. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88671,Kyle,It's Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with Cartman. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88673,Kyle,"I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can't keep on saying ""We told you so"", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn't dumb. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88675,Kyle,No! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88678,Kyle,No I don't! ... Do I? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88681,Kyle,"Yeah, no, we're not getting involved with that. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88683,Kyle,"[stands up]Yeah, no, yeah, I uh dya, I think we need to stay out of it. [walks away] "
21,7,Doubling Down,88686,Kyle,"Cartman, can we talk? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88688,Kyle,"I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88703,Kyle,"You doin' okay, Heidi? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88705,Kyle,"[sits down next to her and sighs] Heidi, people like Cartman, they always make things someone else's fault. We all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim all the time. He'll always find someone to blame for his shortcomings, and because of that, he's never gonna change. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88707,Kyle,"No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88762,Kyle,"[turns around] Cartman, I didn't mean for things to happen the way they did. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88764,Kyle,"Cartman, you weren't happy. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88766,Kyle,All you did was bitch about her all the time. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88768,Kyle,"Come on, Cartman. I- "
21,7,Doubling Down,88770,Kyle,Stop it! 
21,7,Doubling Down,88774,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Cartman. You just have to accept that Heidi's moved on. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88807,Kyle,Hey! You all set to go? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88809,Kyle,"Okay, sure. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88811,Kyle,"Yeah, that's understandable. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88813,Kyle,What do you mean? 
21,7,Doubling Down,88815,Kyle,"But Heidi, I thought- "
21,7,Doubling Down,88817,Kyle,"Dude... did she just call me a dirty Jew? [he walks to the window to see her walk away, and sees Cartman waiting for her. Cartman sees him at the window. Heidi meets Cartman and they walk away together, with Cartman looking over his shoulder at Kyle with a smug look on his face] "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88958,Kyle,"Actually, some of their projects are pretty cool. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89112,Kyle,"[arrives to separate them] Uh, hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you all doing? "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89116,Kyle,"Guys! Guys, this has gone on way too long. Can't we all stop being so mean to each other? [a moment of reflection around the crowd] "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89154,Kyle,For the first time I feel kind of bad for the person being farted on. 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89184,Kyle,Vice Principal Woman? 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89186,Kyle,"My name's Kyle, and I've been doing a lot of changing lately. I came because I might be able to offer some... insight into our problem here. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89188,Kyle,"You see, there's a culture at this school that embraces meanness, and I believe now that it comes from a Canadian TV show. All the boys watch it. I did too. We all laughed while they... farted... on innocent people's heads. The thing is, I never felt for the person being farted on. Until now. I want to work with you to open people's eyes, because I get it now. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89190,Kyle,What? 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89192,Kyle,"But, but I thought for sure YOU would be on my side. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89194,Kyle,"What?? D'oh, forget it! [turns around and walks out] "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89198,Kyle,Rrrrr! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89215,Kyle,"Thanks for having me, Tom. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89217,Kyle,All I'm saying is that there's a culture that originates from Canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now. 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89222,Kyle,"I'm saying we're all guilty too. I grew up watching Terrance & Phillip, and I thought it was funny. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89224,Kyle,"No, it was never funny. I see it differently now. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89226,Kyle,"We don't wanna censor it, we just wanna... get rid of it. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89228,Kyle,"Oh, see? That's what I'm talking about, right there! That kind of mean, degrading, Canadian trash! "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89230,Kyle,Canadians should care about the rest of the world! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89232,Kyle,Maybe I will! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89234,Kyle,Maybe I know the President! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89236,Kyle,Stop calling me that! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89238,Kyle,That's all you know is how to be mean- 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89240,Kyle,Because you were all raised on it yourselves! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89252,Kyle,"[runs into view blowing a referee whistle] Alright! That's it! Everyone stop! We're shutting it down! [the show's crew is stunned, and adult members of Millennials Against Canada come in and confiscate the equipment] We are Millennials Against Canada. We demand this kind of bullying Canadian entertainment be stopped! "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89257,Kyle,"Good. Give it here. [receives it and answers] Yes, hello? This is the leader of Millennials Against Canada. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89259,Kyle,"Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking a stand and doing something. I realize this doesn't gel with your nihilism! "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89261,Kyle,I'm not like my mom! I'm gonna make a difference! It's gonna feel real good! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89306,Kyle,The National Guard? 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89308,Kyle,Yes. This is Millennials Against Canada. 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89310,Kyle,"We can't do that, Mr. President. Someone has to do what's right. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89312,Kyle,"What do I want? I want a world... where laughter doesn't come at someone else's expense. Where people can live freely without fear of being farted on. I want a world where you aren't ridiculed for trying to help. A world where a nice girl that I liked isn't turned into another Eric Cartman! These Canadians are in the way of that world, and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the Earth! "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89345,Kyle,"Ike... Ike, I'm sorry that I caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on Canada. I was just- you know, I was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down. You know, those shows can be really harmful. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89368,Kyle,[Him and Stan walk up with their bikes] What's going on? 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89371,Kyle,Who did? 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89375,Kyle,You saw the President? 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89406,Kyle,It's my fault. Ike went to go take matters into his own hands. I have to find him. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89413,Kyle,I don't need anyone to go with me. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89415,Kyle,I would never have the hots for the person you are now. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89457,Kyle,We need to keep going guys. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89473,Kyle,Ike! Ike? 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89479,Kyle,Can we go please?! 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89481,Kyle,Here it is. [Opens the door] Ike? 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89488,Kyle,He's not here either. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89490,Kyle,"You don't understand Canadians. They're fiercely loyal to their country. When Canada is attacked, they all join in the fight. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89512,Kyle,"Oh, my God! Look! These are Ike's toy binoculars! He was here! Ike! "
22,1,Dead Kids,89584,Kyle,The six by the four! 
22,1,Dead Kids,89598,Kyle,"Yeah, Tolkien's probably sick of you cheating off him all the time. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89871,Kyle,"Oh, there's Butters! "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89877,Kyle,No. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89936,Kyle,"Just leave it alone, Clyde. Butters brings him everywhere. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89984,Kyle,Why me? 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89987,Kyle,"[walks up to Butters] Uh, Butters, can I talk to you really fast? "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89992,Kyle,"Butters, you know, you can just bring your priest with you everywhere. I mean, sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89994,Kyle,"I'm saying it's just kind of awkward, Butters. [Fr. Maxi goes to look for these two boys and just happens to walk by the snack room. He stops just short of the doorway and listens] He's bumming everybody out. Nobody wants to hear about Jesus at a birthday party. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89996,Kyle,"It's not just me. It's everyone, Butters. He can try all he wants, but he just doesn't belong here. [Maxi's face drops, then he walks away quietly] "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90143,Kyle,What? 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90145,Kyle,What Mr. Hankey... tweeted? 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90148,Kyle,"Oh. Jesus Christ, dude. "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90151,Kyle,Mr. Hankey. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90153,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey, everyone's really mad at you. Were you on Twitter last night? "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90155,Kyle,"Did you tweet ""The kids of South Park are retarded homos who can't play music""? "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90157,Kyle,Why would you tweet that?! All the kids are really pissed off! 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90159,Kyle,What do you want me to say? 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90200,Kyle,Mr. Hankey? 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90202,Kyle,What are you doing here? 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90204,Kyle,Me? What can I do? 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90220,Kyle,[runs up] You guys! Hey guys! I think I figured it out. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90222,Kyle,How to get Mr. Hankey another chance. [no reaction from the boys] There's by-laws in the city council that community service leaders can't be terminated without a hearing. I need you guys there as character witnesses. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90225,Kyle,He has a right to be heard. He's meant a lot to this town. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90228,Kyle,"Come on, guys. We can't just turn our backs. How many times has Mr. Hankey been there for us? "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90230,Kyle,"Look, he messed up, but I don't know if he deserves everything that's coming down on him. I wanna stand by my friend. "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90280,Kyle,I had a plan. You decided to call the Mayor a titless whore! 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90282,Kyle,[growls] I don't know how much longer I can defend you. People are starting to think I'm shitty. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90284,Kyle,It's October! 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90286,Kyle,"[looks away] Okay, you do that. "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90288,Kyle,I have homework and stuff! 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90290,Kyle,"Okay, fine! I'll help you. But listen to me: I don't care how restless you get tonight, NO AMBIEN! "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90292,Kyle,"No! None! If you want my help this time, you aren't taking any Ambien tonight. That's the deal! "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90307,Kyle,"[leaps away from the keyboard and grabs Mr. Hankey] Mr. Hankey, stop! "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90316,Kyle,"[turns around] You want them to erase me, too? "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90318,Kyle,"Uh... [sighs a few times, then turns away with nothing to say and walks off] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90361,Kyle,[to Stan] So just like that? Your parents sold your house and everything? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90363,Kyle,Why would your sister wanna get addicted to those things? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90365,Kyle,What are you talking about? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90370,Kyle,"Ike! Ike, do you have a vaping pen?! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90372,Kyle,Dude! Gimme that! [takes it from Ike and walks back to his group] 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90374,Kyle,What is this? [reads the label] Cherry-flavored nicotine. [turns around] Are you joking?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90378,Kyle,Why do you want nicotine?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90380,Kyle,These things are bad for you! Do you understand?! Bad kindergartners! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90391,Kyle,That's gotta be him. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90393,Kyle,"I'm gonna tell him if he sells a vape pen to my brother again, I'm gonna kick his ass! [marches towards the boy. The other follow] HEY YOU! [the boy turns around and steps off the drift. It's...] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90397,Kyle,"Butters, are you selling vapes? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90399,Kyle,WHAT?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90451,Kyle,I need to speak with the principal. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90453,Kyle,I'd rather just talk to him. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90458,Kyle,You know what I'm up to! [walks up to the principal's door.] 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90460,Kyle,Don't touch me! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90462,Kyle,Don't- touch me! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90464,Kyle,You're selling it to kindergartners! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90467,Kyle,You're such penises! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90469,Kyle,You're so full of shit. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90471,Kyle,Ronan Farrow? No he wasn't. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90473,Kyle,Fine. But no more pushing it on little kids! You got that?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90486,Kyle,Just stop. It's so obvious what you guys are doing. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90492,Kyle,[quickly comes up to Cartman and talks quietly] Can I talk to you for a second? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90494,Kyle,Can I talk to you over here? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90496,Kyle,[yelling] What did I say about pushing it on little kids?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90498,Kyle,"Fun, fruity Vaping Man?! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90500,Kyle,"All right, how much do you owe the dealer? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90502,Kyle,How much?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90523,Kyle,"Look, my friend is very stupid and should have never gone into business with you. [Cartman and Butters back off] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90525,Kyle,"I'm just seeing if I can help settle things. You probably don't realize it, but vaping is a really big problem at our school. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90527,Kyle,"Okay, look, this is the money I've saved up from my past three birthdays. Can we call this even and end it? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90530,Kyle,What? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90534,Kyle,"Cartman, what are you doing?? "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90538,Kyle,Oh shit! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90540,Kyle,Wha-what? What are you doing?? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90542,Kyle,WHAT?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90558,Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, I need to talk to you about some things going on at school. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90563,Kyle,You know what I'm doing here! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90565,Kyle,"NO. Mr. Mackey, there's a big operation going on at the school "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90567,Kyle,Things are getting out of control- 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90569,Kyle,-and you need to know what's going on! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90571,Kyle,What?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90575,Kyle,Let go of me! [Cartman lets go] 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90577,Kyle,What's bad?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90579,Kyle,You guys decided to beat up the dealer! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90581,Kyle,How?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90583,Kyle,"We are all in this together, Kyle! We gotta rob the vape shop, and then we can put this all behind us. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90588,Kyle,Aah! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90604,Kyle,Just shut up and keep pumping! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90606,Kyle,"Awww, shit! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90609,Kyle,Mr. Marsh! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90611,Kyle,"All right, listen. I should have talked to an adult from the beginning. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90613,Kyle,There are these three vaping syndicates at our school- 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90615,Kyle,-and these guys are one of them. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90617,Kyle,"They had someone buying stuff from here for them, and then they sold it to kids. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90619,Kyle,"The sixth graders, these guys, and Becky Thompson are all at each other for control of the playground. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90621,Kyle,"I was going to tell an adult, but these guys said they'd stop. "
22,5,The Scoots,90648,Kyle,How? 
22,5,The Scoots,90661,Kyle,"Dude, it worked! [Stan puts his phone away and hops on the e-scooter, then begins riding it] "
22,5,The Scoots,90664,Kyle,[turns around] Oh my God. Dude. Oh my God. 
22,5,The Scoots,90666,Kyle,We should use these things to trick or treat on Halloween! 
22,5,The Scoots,90669,Kyle,Everybody get the app! This is gonna be the best Halloween ever! [he and Cartman whip out their phones and get the app. Kenny has nothing to do.] 
22,5,The Scoots,90672,Kyle,"Oh. Well, that's okay. We'll figure it out. We always do! "
22,5,The Scoots,90692,Kyle,"Kenny, we've been talking and, the truth is, without a scooter, you're just gonna slow us down. "
22,5,The Scoots,90698,Kyle,"Okay, okay. Cartman, that's not the point. "
22,5,The Scoots,90700,Kyle,"That's enough, dude! "
22,5,The Scoots,90742,Kyle,Dude! 
22,5,The Scoots,90804,Kyle,[comes into view with Cartman and Stan] Jesus Christ! Where'd all these other people come from?! 
22,5,The Scoots,90824,Kyle,That's it! I can't go anymore! 
22,5,The Scoots,90828,Kyle,What are we doing? 
22,5,The Scoots,90830,Kyle,I don't... I don't know how I can keep doing this. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90904,Kyle,So what as he doing alone on the playground? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90907,Kyle,And there were bear prints in the snow? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90909,Kyle,You saw what? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90911,Kyle,Jesus. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90932,Kyle,"""Evidence of the creature of South Park."" This is like a conspiracy Web site. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90934,Kyle,ManBearPig? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90937,Kyle,What? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90943,Kyle,Al Gore. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90955,Kyle,"He said he was almost President once. He came to our town once to warn us about something, [hands her a photo] and we have to find him. [the photo is revealed to be a head shot of Al Gore signed ""To my Best Friends! - Al"".] "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90967,Kyle,"Please, Mr. Gore! We need your help! ManBearPig isn't going to stop! "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90969,Kyle,"Please, just tell us. How do you stop it? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90992,Kyle,"So, ahum, now maybe we can all work together, huh? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90994,Kyle,"[fed up] Okay, can we stop ManBearPig now?! "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91019,Kyle,Is it some sort of genetic mutation? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91023,Kyle,What? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91044,Kyle,"Dude, come on. What are we doing? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91053,Kyle,"Wait. Wait, are you videoing us? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91065,Kyle,Dude! You summoned Satan! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91073,Kyle,"Dude, Satan's not gonna go with us to the- "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91081,Kyle,"Okay, so wait. Now you're saying that someone in our town made a deal with that thing? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91097,Kyle,No! You can't! [other officers come in and deal with the boys] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91115,Kyle,"But we do! ManBearPig is gonna kill everyone, and he's not gonna stop! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91119,Kyle,"[walks up] Nobody's coming for us, Stan. They think we're murderers. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91164,Kyle,"Mom? [goes to the living room] Dad? [walks upstairs to the master bedroom, opens the door, and looks in, then closes it. He goes to his room and sits on his bed. He looks up] I don't know if you can hear me. I-I feel so alone right now. I-I feel like the whole world is falling apart and somehow I'm supposed to do something but... I don't know what that is anymore. [the window lights up] "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91166,Kyle,Mr. Gore? Where have you been?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91168,Kyle,Yeah. Where have you been?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91170,Kyle,Well what happened to you? Are you dead or something? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91172,Kyle,"What, what? [turns around] Oh, god damn it. [Gore turns off the flashlight and turns on the bedroom light] "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91174,Kyle,I can't do this alone. I need help. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91176,Kyle,"What more do you want from me?? I've atoned for my mistake. I'm sorry that we were getting a lot of different information at the time. You know, even you were wrong about a lot of the things you said would happen a- "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91178,Kyle,Nothing. I didn't mean- 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91180,Kyle,"[gives chase] No, no, no, no! I'm sorry! [follows him down the stairs] I am sorry, please! I'm cereal! Ah, I didn't mean to say you were wrong, just that some of your predictions didn't happen- "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91182,Kyle,"Please, please, please! [Gore turns to look at him] I'll do anything! I just want everyone to be safe! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91217,Kyle,Go where? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91219,Kyle,Al Gore isn't dead. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91223,Kyle,"We shouldn't be out here. We're wanted by the police. [some growling and howling is heard, with the sound of cracking branches] "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91228,Kyle,It's Satan. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91233,Kyle,Work together how?? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91254,Kyle,Credits? [some clapping is heard. The boys turn around and see Al Gore by a movie projector] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91281,Kyle,Satan! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91283,Kyle,"[he and the other boys are starting to tear up] No. Satan, you can't die. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91287,Kyle,"If you can't stop ManBearPig, how can we be-?? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91291,Kyle,"Come back. Come back. [a light appears around Satan's body, and his spirit rises from it. As he rises to Heaven, a small bell tolls and he gets angel wings and a halo.] "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91293,Kyle,"[tears streaming from his face] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91306,Kyle,"[leaves the window] All right, looks like we're clear. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91308,Kyle,This is the best place to hide. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91311,Kyle,"Where's the last place anyone would think we would hide? The scene of our supposed crime, dummies! We're safe here. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91315,Kyle,Stan! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91317,Kyle,How'd you find us here? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91344,Kyle,"Well, what's he want everyone to give up? "
22,8,Buddha Box,91441,Kyle,What the hell is that? 
22,8,Buddha Box,91443,Kyle,What is it doing? 
22,8,Buddha Box,91499,Kyle,"Here it comes! Block it! [the player kicks the ball towards the net. Cartman stands there oblivious that there's a game going on. The ball goes cleanly into the net. The player smiles as the whistle blows.] What the fuck, dude?! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91502,Kyle,"They just scored again, you fat fuck! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91504,Kyle,"Can we get another goalie, please?! "
22,8,Buddha Box,91560,Kyle,Go! [no reaction] GO! [thumps the Box to get Cartman's attention] 
22,8,Buddha Box,91562,Kyle,Go down the slide or get out of the way! 
22,8,Buddha Box,91564,Kyle,"[to a nearby lifeguard] Can we move him, please?! [the lifeguard is revealed to be wearing a Buddha Box] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91567,Kyle,[approaching] Get! Off! My! Towel! [knocks the Buddha Box off Cartman's head] Get off my towel! 
22,8,Buddha Box,91569,Kyle,"[Stan, Clyde, and Tolkien look on] I got news for you, Cartman! Everyone has anxiety! Everyone gets nervous! Everyone is afraid being around people! Everyone has feelings they'd rather stay home alone! And you know what they do? They get over it. And they stop being a piece of shit!  "
22,8,Buddha Box,91571,Kyle,Yes! 
22,8,Buddha Box,91573,Kyle,What? No. No! What did I just do? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91658,Kyle,What do you mean? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91660,Kyle,"[music picks up] Four bikes, one common theme. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91665,Kyle,[pulls out his phone and starts tapping away] I'll start looking for costumes! What theme are we thinking? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91721,Kyle,There's no time. Let's face it. We can't be in the bike parade. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91726,Kyle,Oh yeah! The mall! 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91731,Kyle,There's nobody here. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91736,Kyle,Are you the only one still at the mall? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91756,Kyle,"I think maybe it was a bad idea to come here, you guys. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91772,Kyle,Yeah. And the four of us are actually doing a group theme. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91840,Kyle,Yehehes! Yeessss! 
22,10,Bike Parade,91842,Kyle,I got fulfilled! It's all the stuff I ordered for the bike parade. [his phone rings and he answers it] Yeah? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91847,Kyle,"No, Dad. These were special deliveries from Jeff Bezos. We helped Amazon with their strike, and he had our orders shipped. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91850,Kyle,[giggles] Yeah. We helped him find workers to work during the strike. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91852,Kyle,So he found our orders and had them sent to us. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91944,Kyle,They look amazing. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91946,Kyle,"[notices Kenny arriving] All right, Kenny's here. [to Kenny] Come on, dude. We're gonna take 'em for a test spin. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91949,Kyle,Well why not? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91953,Kyle,"Kenny, you can't quit now! We have a four-bike theme! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91974,Kyle,How's it look like it's going? There's no way we're going to win this stupid bike parade! 
22,10,Bike Parade,91976,Kyle,[comes out to the driveway] Face it Stan! Our bikes suck! We're gonna lose! We're gonna be the laughingstock of the whole thing! 
22,10,Bike Parade,91980,Kyle,I wish there never was a bike parade. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91987,Kyle,What's offensive about a bike parade? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91989,Kyle,"Oh, I get it. "
22,10,Bike Parade,92023,Kyle,I can't believe Kenny bailed on us just because he thinks Jeff Bezos is a bad guy. 
22,10,Bike Parade,92059,Kyle,Such bullcrap. 
22,10,Bike Parade,92062,Kyle,"[turns away from the bridge, followed by Stan and Cartman] No. No! The problem is that when it comes to outrage, your average person actually doesn't give a shit, unless it has something to do with them. "
22,10,Bike Parade,92073,Kyle,Kenny was right about you. You're a bad guy! 
22,10,Bike Parade,92077,Kyle,Why are you doing this?! 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92151,Kyle,What do you want? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92154,Kyle,"Yeah, 'cause you were gonna snap her bra. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92156,Kyle,Fuck you. 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92158,Kyle,"Are you done now? Can I hang up? [as Ike opens the door, ICE agents burst in and fan out] "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92160,Kyle,Hello? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92169,Kyle,Mom! Dad! 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92179,Kyle,"Goddamit, Cartman! "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92215,Kyle,"Here! [the agent is shocked and looks around, then looks at David, approaching] "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92217,Kyle,"No, I'm Jewish. [Jeff and the other two agents are alarmed.] "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92219,Kyle,I'm just here because some fat intolerant asshole didn't want me around! 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92236,Kyle,What about all the other kids? When do they get to go home? 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92238,Kyle,My people? Aren't you worried about what you're creating here?! 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92240,Kyle,You're pulling children away from their parents and isolating them behind bars. 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92242,Kyle,You're traumatizing them and teaching them to fear the U.S. government. 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92244,Kyle,"Okay, let me try to put this in terms you people will understand. You know superhero movies, right? "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92246,Kyle,"Okay. You remember how they always create the villain? Some random person who, when they were a child, got taken from their parents and locked away? And the kid was just left to sit and plot revenge? What you're doing here is creating a Mexican Joker! [The agents get alarmed again] And what's a Mexican Joker gonna do? He's gonna grow up and have memories of being wronged by you, and he will grow and wait, and then finally [makes a fist with his right hand and pounds it into his left hand] fight back with a passion unlike anything you've ever seen! "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92248,Kyle,"No, it could be any of them! That's the point! You don't know which kid in there is gonna snap from being separated and locked down like this! "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92250,Kyle,"Mexican Joker doesn't care! When that kid grows up, all that will matter is getting back at all of you! "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92290,Kyle,What the fuck are you doing here?! 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92292,Kyle,I haven't seen my parents in *two weeks*! Nobody even knows where my little brother is! 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92323,Kyle,Wait. I have an idea how to get everyone out of here. Get everyone's aluminum foil and some scissors. 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92325,Kyle,Just do it before I kill you! 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92350,Kyle,"Shema Israel Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai ehad. [""Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.""] "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92358,Kyle,"Goddamnit, nobody here is Mexican Joker! That's not what I meant! The future is not set! We make decisions now that affect our future! "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92360,Kyle,NO!! 
23,2,Band in China,92534,Kyle,Anything happen while we were gone? 
23,3,Shots,92598,Kyle,Cartman can't come to this school anymore? 
23,3,Shots,92600,Kyle,"Oh my God. [smiles] I don't know how long this will last, but I'm gonna savor every minute. "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93118,Kyle,"We're just saying, Butters, that sometimes it all seems a little codependent. "
23,6,Season Finale,93241,Kyle,"Just hike the stupid ball, Cartman. "

23,7,Board Girls,93510,Kyle,"Dude, you're really into board games. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93656,Kyle,A bacterial infection? In her stomach? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93658,Kyle,So what can you do for her? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93662,Kyle,"Ike, if Mom lives, we can't let anyone ever know about this. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93683,Kyle,Yes! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93685,Kyle,"Yuch. [tosses it away, then wipes his hands clean on his jacket.] "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93687,Kyle,Yeesh. 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93689,Kyle,Eewww! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93691,Kyle,Aaagh! [runs off] 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93711,Kyle,[wakes up and sits upright] Aaah! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93713,Kyle,Do you guys have any idea what I'm saying?! Half the cells in our bodies aren't human! Right now there are alive creatures in your eyelashes and in your teeth! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93715,Kyle,"So?! Right now, that straw has a bunch of little bugs and they're going in your mouth and mixing with trillions of other little bugs that are alive inside you! You aren't even totally you! "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93717,Kyle,"Okay, guys, listen. My mom had a fecal transplant. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93720,Kyle,Why? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93727,Kyle,What?! Eww! No! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93730,Kyle,That is disgusting. Absolutely not! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93734,Kyle,What is MY problem?! I'm not gonna go steal my mom's shit! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93737,Kyle,"I said ""no"", and that's final! "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93747,Kyle,The fuck are you doing?! [the others turn around] 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93749,Kyle,You are NOT stealing my mom's shit! 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93752,Kyle,"It just freaks me out, Doc. [the doctor listens to Kyle breathing and heartbeat] We all have these... things... living inside our bodies, and everyone just seems fine with it. It's like, as soon as people learn they have microbiomes, the first thing they want to do is start swapping them. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93754,Kyle,"But where does it stop?! Then, are people just gonna start wanting skinny people's microbiomes to be skinny? Or an athlete's microbiome to feel athletic and young again? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93756,Kyle,"Well like, what about Tom Brady's poop? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93758,Kyle,I'm just saying that Tom Brady seems to work really hard on his diet and stuff. His shit must be pretty good. 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93760,Kyle,[uncomfortable from the hard stare] What? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93876,Kyle,"The bookcase. [presses a button on the panel in front of him and the bookcase recedes and opens up, revealing a vault full of Tom Brady's poop in mason jars.] "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93893,Kyle,"I didn't know. My microbiome did. All along they were trying to tell me something. I really learned that I'm not just me. I'm also all the creatures inside of me. From now on, I'm gonna trust my gut a little more. [pats his belly] "
23,9,Basic Cable,94072,Kyle,"Put it back to Mandalorian, Jimmy! Nobody likes PC Babies.  "
23,9,Basic Cable,94090,Kyle,"Yeah! Come on, Sophie! "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94284,Kyle,"Yeah, what the hell happened? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94380,Kyle,Hi. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94466,Kyle,What are you doing here?? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94468,Kyle,"Dude, get out of my house! If you wanna talk, we can go outside! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94470,Kyle,"[covers his mouth and nose under his jacket] Dude, you could be spreading germs! [backs away] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94472,Kyle,So? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94474,Kyle,I want an education! I want to be able to compete for a job when I get older! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94476,Kyle,You really wanna spend the next year on Zoom? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94478,Kyle,You're out of your room hanging out with me now! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94551,Kyle,Fuck you! [Kyle jumps out of his seat and beats him up. The other kids start cheering] 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94632,Kyle,Hey dude. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94634,Kyle,You think he got the virus? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94636,Kyle,I know. This bullshit sucks. But Butters will be okay. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94638,Kyle,You really think it's that bad? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94709,Kyle,"Who else can we call, Stan? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94752,Kyle,Okay! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94754,Kyle,"Dude, we made it. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94761,Kyle,A mustache? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94766,Kyle,"[walks up to Stan with Cartman] Come on, dude. We'd better get outta here before we're spotted. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94768,Kyle,What do you mean? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94770,Kyle,And then do what? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94774,Kyle,"Dude, you need people to help you do the stuffing and the closing. You don't- you don't actually build your own bear. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94806,Kyle,"Dude, just let it go. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94808,Kyle,"[walks up to Stan] Stan, are you sure this is about Butters? 'Cause you seem really desperate to build a bear. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94821,Kyle,Hey! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94825,Kyle,[awed by this act of mercy] I don't believe it. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94866,Kyle,What? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94882,Kyle,"[the boys suddenly stop, right in front of Butters' house] You're not posting anything! Do you have any idea what you've done? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94886,Kyle,What if they make us go back to remote learning?! I don't want to go back to being quarantined at home like some of the other kids still are! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94946,Kyle,Why do people think we all did the period joke? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94948,Kyle,You guys are gonna go and tell everyone the truth about who's fault this is! I didn't do anything! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94950,Kyle,What?! Dude! [to Stan] Are you just gonna stand there and listen to this crap?! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94953,Kyle,"Will you shut up about that!? Nobody cares about your stupid broship! [Kenny starts to cry and leaves, while Cartman and Kyle sadly look at him] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94985,Kyle,Yes. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94987,Kyle,"[points at Cartman and Kenny] Because you guys pulled a prank and made the teacher leave, and now everybody hates us. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95014,Kyle,What?! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95016,Kyle,"Yeah, but we already paid you. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95024,Kyle,We're Kommunity Kidz. We help seniors get vaccinated. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95028,Kyle,"Cartman, just stick to the fucking plan! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95034,Kyle,RUN!! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95089,Kyle,"[angry] Why did you almost blow it at the very end, you idiot?! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95091,Kyle,[walks up to Stan] Will you please say something to him?! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95105,Kyle,[to the boys] Grab the vaccines. I think we better get outta here. [the crowd tries to break into the house] 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95125,Kyle,All good? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95128,Kyle,I don't see what choice we have. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95132,Kyle,[irritated] What? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95136,Kyle,[angrily] What are you doing? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95138,Kyle,[points outside] We are giving these to the teachers at the school! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95140,Kyle,"[glaring at Cartman] What the broship needs is for us to do the right thing and fix the problem of everyone hating us! [the rest of the boys are silent for a moment] Right, Stan? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95143,Kyle,"[""[angrily] You guys are being selfish! You're not thinking about what's best for the broship. You're thinking about what's best for you. We did all this because we wanted to fix the damage of the period prank. That means taking these to the school tomorrow morning for our teachers. [walks up to the tray with the vaccines he picks it up] I'm gonna put these somewhere safe so no one gets tempted to do the wrong thing! ""]"
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95146,Kyle,"[looking at his phone] Oh, crap. [he taps his phone screen] Hey, dad. Look, I'm okay. I won't be home until tomorrow 'cause... well, I'm doing something really important. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95148,Kyle,[confused] You're not... worried? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95150,Kyle,[annoyed] They're for our teachers. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95152,Kyle,It's not like that. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95154,Kyle,"Dad, please don't- "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95156,Kyle,[closing his eyes] Please don't say it. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95158,Kyle,[lowers his phone] Shit. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95180,Kyle,[panicked] I'm just getting things ready to go. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95182,Kyle,"Alright, Stan, look. It's just the pressure of everything, okay!? My dad called and... I don't want my mom to die. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95185,Kyle,"[he and Stan look away] Nothing, Kenny. Everything's fine. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95205,Kyle,Butters? [points to Butters] You're a part of this too? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95219,Kyle,"Oh no! Oh, Jesus, look! [a crowd of adults are running towards South Park Elementary school] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95246,Kyle,[angry] What was that!? You know we can't get into the school! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95248,Kyle,You didn't even try! [looks to Stan]. He didn't try because he wants to sell the vaccines for money! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95251,Kyle,"Wow. Okay. I thought we had gotten past that, but -- "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95253,Kyle,Are you seriously saying what I think? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95261,Kyle,[lifts the cooler with the vaccines] We still have a bunch of vaccines here. What happens now? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95292,Kyle,Uh huh. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95294,Kyle,Do we really have to do this? That- that all seems overly confusing. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95298,Kyle,"Aw, come on. What about sleepovers? We can't take those away from Kenny. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95306,Kyle,I don't even know what to say... 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95321,Kyle,We set out to do something. I'm not letting our broship fall to the pandi just yet. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95339,Kyle,Mrs. Nelson? We're here! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95343,Kyle,"We got your vaccination for you, Mrs. Nelson. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95357,Kyle,I guess it is what's best for everybody. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95360,Kyle,"And I'll come pick you up on Thursday, Kenny. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95388,Kyle,We didn't even do anything wrong! 
25,1,Pajama Day,95502,Kyle,Dude! 
25,2,The Big Fix,95638,Kyle,[he answers] Hey Stan. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95640,Kyle,Not gonna believe what? 
25,2,The Big Fix,95642,Kyle,"Yeah, I know it's Tolkien. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95644,Kyle,"Yeah, I know. J.R.R. Tolkien. What did you think it was? "
25,2,The Big Fix,95646,Kyle,Everyone knew it was Tolkien. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95648,Kyle,"Yeah, dude, ‘cuz Cartman's a fuckin' moron. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96243,Kyle,"Dad! Dad, there's this new place and you can actually go and shoot each other, only it's soft BBs and they're biodegradable, and the guns are, like, totally real except you don't actually get hurt, and it's like paintball except for there's no mess, and the stuff all looks totally real, and it's called Airsoft and can I get one? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96245,Kyle,"There's an airsoft field where everybody plays on teams, and I promise I'll take good care of the equipment, and if you think about it, it's a really great hobby for team building and learning communication and – "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96247,Kyle,"I was just thinking if you could come to the Airsoft store with me – [clasps his hands together] please, please, please, all my friends already bought their stuff, and it's totally a way for us to play outside like you always say – [rushes out to the door] come on, please only we can't tell mom cuz she won't understand, but it's totally safe cuz you wear eye protection. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96250,Kyle,Here it is! Isn't this cool?! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96252,Kyle,"Come on, dad! You gotta check it out! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96255,Kyle,"No, dad! It's Airsoft. It's like paintball, only it's way cooler and it just looks totally real. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96257,Kyle,"Dad… please. I'm not a baby anymore. The other guys – they already got their stuff. We're playing today! Can I please just get, like, an AK-47 and maybe a glock? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96259,Kyle,"[excitedly] Yeah, yeah! It really is! [he walks away to check out other merchandise] "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96296,Kyle,"I got you, Cartman! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96298,Kyle,I totally got you! I heard it hit your jacket. Say hit and and go back to respawn. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96307,Kyle,"Ow, oww! [he raises his hand and walks off] Hit! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96310,Kyle,That was so cool! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96315,Kyle,That was seriously the best time I've had in forever! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96318,Kyle,I know! My teenager said he's gonna come over and show me how to clean my gun! [he notices Cartman crying] Cartman? Are you ok? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96324,Kyle,"I took a BB right to the face with a sniper rifle. It was so great, dad! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96326,Kyle,"I'm not a baby anymore, dad! [the doorbell rings] Ooh! Oh, that's probably my teenager! See ya, dad! I love you! [he makes his way to go open the door] "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96328,Kyle,[the doorbell ring is being constantly rung] I got it! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96333,Kyle,Yeah! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96335,Kyle,"Yeah, that's right! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96341,Kyle,"Cool, dude, so, uh, you wanna, like, clean our Airsoft guns? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96343,Kyle,"Well…Like, what kind of food do you want? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96345,Kyle,Okay! Okay! Okay! [he walks away from Trevor] 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96369,Kyle,"Dude, Kenny, the weirdest thing just happened. My teenager showed up at my house and he's acting really strange. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96371,Kyle,Yours did too? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96375,Kyle,What the hell are these things? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96391,Kyle,"Yeah, I know! My teenager asked me to take him shopping for hair gel. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96393,Kyle,"Just do your best, I'll be there as fast as I can! [hangs up the call] Okay, here it is. This is the health care aisle. Could you go a little faster? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96395,Kyle,"Okay, here's all the hair product stuff. Which one would you like to use? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96397,Kyle,What? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96400,Kyle,"Ugh, nothing, I'm… I'm just shopping with my teenager. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96402,Kyle,"Okay, but you asked me if I could buy you some hair gel. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96406,Kyle,"Your guy wants hair gel, too? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96408,Kyle,I just wanna get to the Airsoft field. Stan says your team is killing them. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96410,Kyle,"Yeah, we'll see when I use my sniper rifle! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96443,Kyle,"Well, you're lucky. At least your teenager doesn't threaten to kill you. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96450,Kyle,And we love it. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96452,Kyle,"Well, apparently a lot of people are in the same situation we're in. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96454,Kyle,"I've been reading this book—""Help, My Teenager Hates Me"". "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96456,Kyle,Yeah…and… it has some interesting ideas. It says we're basically just dealing with an age difference and we need to try and connect with them. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96458,Kyle,It says…we should take them camping. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96464,Kyle,"Yeah, check 'em out! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96466,Kyle,There's a lake over there where we can rent kayaks! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96477,Kyle,No… I don't think I'm gonna go… 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96479,Kyle,"You wouldn't understand, Dad. I just can't deal with teenagers. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96481,Kyle,"You know, I just [Kyle starts to get teary eyed]—I just wanted to have fun—and shoot my friends. [Kyle reaches closer to Gerald, crying] I-I just wanted to shoot my friends, dad. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96483,Kyle,"We did! They said they hate the teenagers just as much as anybody, but they can't get rid of them. And we've got no one else to partner with. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96518,Kyle,"We got new partners, guys! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96551,Kyle,"[to the parents] Hey, thanks, you guys. We couldn't have gotten rid of the teenagers without you. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96558,Kyle,"Come on, guys! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96597,Kyle,"Hey, Butters. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96815,Kyle,"Hey, dudes. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96817,Kyle,Just wondering if you guys have seen me and Tolkien's latest TikTok? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96825,Kyle,"Well, anyway you guys gotta check it out when you get a chance. See ya later! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96864,Kyle,"Hey, Stan. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96869,Kyle,"Oh, no sorry. I was actually just seeing if you had a phone charger I could borrow. Me and Tolkien are making another TikTok video and my stupid phone died! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96872,Kyle,"Thanks, dude! [walks away] Tolkien, I got one, dude! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96888,Kyle,"Wow, that's so cool, Tolkien! Look how many likes we're getting for this one. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96891,Kyle,"Yeah, what's up? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96893,Kyle,What? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96895,Kyle,"[angrily] I'm not even going to justify that with a response. Because repeating a derogatory slur, even for the purpose of refuting it, can make stupid people think it's valid! [he storms off] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96906,Kyle,Lots of people run Hollywood!! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96943,Kyle,"Hey, I didn't see you at the playground. Thought we were doing that morning TikTok. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96945,Kyle,Everything okay? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96948,Kyle,"Good, Jimmy. How are you? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96951,Kyle,"Is there something you wanted, Jimmy? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96953,Kyle,Anything like what? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96955,Kyle,"[frustrated] Jimmy, I do not run Hollywood! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96957,Kyle,[louder] Everyone! I do not run Hollywood! Get a fucking clue! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96959,Kyle,God dammit! This thing has gotten out of control! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96961,Kyle,"It's a huge deal! It's an attack on my ethnicity, Tolkien! You don't understand! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96963,Kyle,"Yeah, Tolkien. There's lots of Black people in the NBA, but nobody says, ""The NBA is run by Black people!"" "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96965,Kyle,"Okay, yeah good point. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96967,Kyle,"Yeah, sure. We still have time. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96985,Kyle,[Kyle walks into the kitchen angered.]God dammit! I do not fucking run Hollywood! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96988,Kyle,He’s just being an idiot and listening to what fucking Eric Cartman said! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96990,Kyle,Who?! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97007,Kyle,"[With a high pitched playback voice.] What is it, Caillou?   "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97009,Kyle,"[With a high pitched playback voice.] Sure thing, Caillou, as long as it’s free.   "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97011,Kyle,"Okay, wait, wait, cut. Hang on. [Out of the TikTok interface.] Let’s try again. I think you forgot the words. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97013,Kyle,"Nah, you do the kid part. It’s funnier. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97015,Kyle,What’s that supposed to mean? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97017,Kyle,"Oh, I’m in charge. Like I, control things? Huh, are you gonna start saying I run Hollywood now too? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97019,Kyle,You’re sick of hearing it? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97021,Kyle,"[Cartman creeps up from the bushes.] Oh my God, are you listening to yourself? You of all people should have some compassion! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97023,Kyle,"[Cartman smiles at the fight from behind the bushes.] You seriously don’t know why? You know that Jews have stood alongside Blacks since the Civil Rights movement began, right? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97025,Kyle,I’m just saying I thought you’d be a better friend. ‘Cause you’re like… 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97028,Kyle,"Whatever, Tolkien. Now you’re gonna act like I somehow did something wrong to you. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97030,Kyle,"You people?! No, it works that way for you people! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97032,Kyle,[Kyle takes the tripod and prepares to leave.] I don’t wanna make TikToks with you anymore! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97034,Kyle,Good! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97095,Kyle,W-What do you mean? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97100,Kyle,Tolkien? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97104,Kyle,Holy shit! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97123,Kyle,"My message is, we can't control what people say, so we have to be smart about what we choose to believe. If one idiot says that a certain group ""runs Hollywood"", look into it. With very minimal effort, you will find that ""Hollywood"" is a multi-tiered industry run by tens of thousands of people from all over the world. In the past, Jews were shut out of most professions, so they came to dominate vaudeville, which back then was considered too low-brow for good Christians. Those Jews eventually moved West and started the first movie studios when movies were also considered work for the underclass, and their descendents are now a decent percentage of the thousands of people of all races that make Hollywood run. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97128,Kyle,"Woah, woah-- wait, what? Woah. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97132,Kyle,God dammit! 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97139,Kyle,"Ike -- Ike, come on, dude, you can't keep doing this. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97141,Kyle,"Ike, the Queen died like four months ago. You gotta let it go. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97146,Kyle,"Okay, it's 7:00, it's my turn to use the computer. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97148,Kyle,"Ike, me and my friends are playing ""Darktide"" right now. Get off! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97154,Kyle,"Ike, I'm playing ""Darktide"" with my friends! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97156,Kyle,"Ike, goddamn it, get off!! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97158,Kyle,"Hey, guys. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97161,Kyle,"Look, I know you think I haven't been showing up for things, but -- but I got screwed by my little brother. He just keeps crying about the Queen. And then there's this Prince and his wife and they're bashing the Canadian monarchy. [The rest of the boys exchange glances at each other as Kyle continues talking] I guess it's like people don't even know why they showed up to the funeral. But anyway, I'm really sorry I ruined game time for everyone. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97163,Kyle,"What? Y-You guys, we -- we said we'd all level up together. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97167,Kyle,"But this isn't fair, it wasn't my fault. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97175,Kyle,What stinks? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97177,Kyle,[confused] My brand? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97180,Kyle,I'm just -- I-I'm just me. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97182,Kyle,"Butters, this seems very out of character for you. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97184,Kyle,Brand management? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97231,Kyle,Yeah. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97233,Kyle,I-I don't think that's really me. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97235,Kyle,I'm not -- I'm not that outdoorsy. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97247,Kyle,What the hell? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97249,Kyle,What? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97251,Kyle,"You guys, I am so sorry. I totally was going to play with you guys online but the Prince of Canada and his wife moved in across the street from me. They have this huge jet parked in front of my house and then they kept trying to get me to buy their stupid book and -- and, anyway, I'm sorry I messed up another game night. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97254,Kyle,"Well, I just want you guys to know that I am a reliable, fun-loving, punctual victim. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97256,Kyle,I'm really working on myself! You're gonna like what you see! [His smile drops] 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97268,Kyle,"God, fuck these people! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97273,Kyle,"Yeah, the neighbors across the steet are setting off fireworks and it's 10:30 at night! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97275,Kyle,"Yes. They're being super loud, and I'm trying to work on my brand! [he checks his window] Oh, god damn it. Now, the Prince is playing polo on the lawn![The Prince is shown playing polo, continuing to be very loud along with his wife.] "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97278,Kyle,"Hey, can you two fucking keep it down?! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97280,Kyle,"Yeah, nobody gives a shit! Will you two just shut up, and go away?! [Another ball hits Kyle's window, smashing it.] "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97282,Kyle,"It seriously is driving me crazy! The prince plays drums all day. I don't think he even has a job. And I don't know what the hell she does. Why they even left Canada is beyond me. And, like, she seems to just boss him around, and make him do whatever she wants. I mean, why did they even leave Canada and move to South Park, anyway? "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97285,Kyle,Say what? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97287,Kyle,I don't care about them either! 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97289,Kyle,[He stutters and isn't able to come up with anything] 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97291,Kyle,I'm sick of hearing about them! But I can't get away from them! They're everywhere! In my fucking face! 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97293,Kyle,"Fine, I won't talk about them anymore. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97296,Kyle,"Ok, just one last thing -- did you know the Prince sleeps- "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97298,Kyle,I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97301,Kyle,But I just don't feel like my brand is who I really am on the inside. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97303,Kyle,I guess so. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97305,Kyle,I want them to think I'm not gonna complain about things. I'm more thick-skinned. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97307,Kyle,"And I want people to think I'm stronger, mentally, than I probably already am. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97309,Kyle,I just don't know if I can-- 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97312,Kyle,I don't care. Don't care. [he goes inside] 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97321,Kyle,"Hey, guys! How you doin?! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97323,Kyle,"I'm great! Got some good sleep last night. Just letting things roll right off my back, you know? 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97325,Kyle,"Hey, you guys want to play ""Darktide"" after school? Or if not, whatever. I'm cool either way. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97327,Kyle,"Cool, whatever. I'm care-free and unflappable. I'll catch you guys at lunch! [he walks away, Jimmy approaches him] "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97329,Kyle,Do you like it? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97331,Kyle,"Thanks, Jimmy. But you know, I really need to thank a good friend. He introduced me to a way of becoming a more stable person. Have you seen Butters? "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97333,Kyle,What?! 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97336,Kyle,"Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is going on?! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97341,Kyle,"Butters, what are you doing?! This isn't you. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97343,Kyle,"Okay, that does it -- come on, Butters. You're going back to CumHammer. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97356,Kyle,"Come on, Butters. Hello? "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97358,Kyle,"Uh, no. This is an emergency. We need to talk to -- "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97361,Kyle,What the hell are you doing here?! 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97364,Kyle,"I'm not obsessed with you! It's this stupid place! Don't you see, Butters? Teaching people to think of their brand just makes people more like them. This whole thing is wrong. They're telling you guys to reduce yourselves into products instead of people to be truly understood and loved. Don't you guys want people to like you for you instead of who they want you to be? Look, we all have our faults. God knows I do. But if we just try to present and control an image of us for people to see, then, we're just performers instead of human beings. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97368,Kyle,"Come on, Butters. Time to go home. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97379,Kyle,"Ike, I need to use the -- Oh no, not again... "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97381,Kyle,"Ike, I have to get on the computer. The Queen's been dead a long time. [Ike continues to cry] Ike! I have to get on with my friends! If I don't, they're gonna think I'm... "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97383,Kyle,It's okay. Things get to you. It's who you are. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97385,Kyle,"Oh. Hey, guys. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97387,Kyle,Really? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97389,Kyle,"Yeah. Yeah, I have. [he smiles a bit] Thanks, guys. I'd love to play. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97935,Kyle,"Dude, did you hear what happened to your girlfriend? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97937,Kyle,"Dude, she got caught cheating on her essay. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97983,Kyle,"You wouldn't last four hours on a job, fatass. "
