21,4,Franchise Prequel,87984,Kenny,He just likes this plan because he gets two movies in Phase 1. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87987,Kenny,Yeah! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87992,Kenny,"We'll make WAY more money on OUR franchise! [Tolkien and Tweek leave, then Kenny leaves] "

22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90221,Kenny,(What?) 
22,5,The Scoots,90670,Kenny,"(Oh wait, you guys. See, I don't have a phone.) "
22,5,The Scoots,90688,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) [runs to Cartman's house] (Hey dude, check it out! I got my pail!) "
22,5,The Scoots,90690,Kenny,(Yup!) 
22,5,The Scoots,90694,Kenny,(But we always trick or treat together) 
22,5,The Scoots,90696,Kenny,"(Guys, please.) "
22,5,The Scoots,90719,Kenny,"(Hey dude. Uh, look. I was wondering, do you think I could trick or treat with you guys this year?) "
22,5,The Scoots,90721,Kenny,"(Oh, you know, I just thought I'd switch it up this year, hehe) "
22,5,The Scoots,90723,Kenny,(Oh I won't slow you guys down. I swear!) 
22,5,The Scoots,90731,Kenny,"(Hey guys!) [silence. He chuckles and says] (So listen, I was thinking, maybe I'd trick or treat with you guys this year!) "
22,5,The Scoots,90733,Kenny,"(Oh, you know! Just trying to be gender-neutral, hahahaha!) "
22,5,The Scoots,90773,Kenny,"(I, I just... It's Halloween and I should be happy, but I'm not happy at all.) "
22,5,The Scoots,90775,Kenny,(Yeah! What should I do? I'm gonna miss trick-or-treating. It sucks.) 
22,5,The Scoots,90777,Kenny,(I can't use one. I don't have a phone.) 
22,5,The Scoots,90779,Kenny,"(No. It sucks. Halloween was a night without phones, man.) "
22,5,The Scoots,90781,Kenny,(I don't know. I guess if you-) [snaps his fingers] (Wait a minute. Take down the cell phone tower. Then nobody has a phone on Halloween!) 
22,5,The Scoots,90783,Kenny,"(Yeah! I just have to ride thirty minutes outside of town! Oh, wait. I can't. I don't have a scooter.) "
22,5,The Scoots,90808,Kenny,(Let's just hope to hell this works.) 
22,5,The Scoots,90811,Kenny,"(Yeah, people don't even care if shit's dumped everywhere. Everyone just loves technology) "
22,5,The Scoots,90834,Kenny,(Find a way inside. I'll climb the tower.) 
22,5,The Scoots,90836,Kenny,"(Oh, fuck!) [the guard is dressed as Jason Voorhees] "
22,5,The Scoots,90841,Kenny,"(Dude, relax. It's okay.) "
22,5,The Scoots,90855,Kenny,"(Okay, that's got it!) "

22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91221,Kenny,"(Yeah, are you in or not?) [Kyle stays silent] "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91225,Kenny,(Sounds like a fuckin' werewolf!) 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91227,Kenny,(What the fuck is that?!) [points to something. Satan jumps into the beam of light with a display of might] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91289,Kenny,(No...) 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91310,Kenny,(Yeah!) 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91313,Kenny,(Oh shit!)

22,9,Unfulfilled,91654,Kenny,(Bike parades ARE stupid.) 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91662,Kenny,(Yeah!) 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91718,Kenny,(No. Nothing.) [the other three sigh] 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91723,Kenny,(Well I don't know.)

22,9,Unfulfilled,91780,Kenny,"(Yeah. Shit, let's get the fuck out of here.) "
22,10,Bike Parade,91861,Kenny,"(No, Dad. These are all for the bike parade.) "
22,10,Bike Parade,91947,Kenny,"(Guys, listen to me. I'm not gonna do the bike parade.) "
22,10,Bike Parade,91950,Kenny,(It's complicated. I talked to my father and he says it's all a bunch of commodity fetishism.) 
22,10,Bike Parade,91952,Kenny,"(Yes, it's stupid, but I'm out.) [turns and walks away] "
22,10,Bike Parade,91955,Kenny,"(I can't do it, guys! I quit.) [walks off] "
22,10,Bike Parade,91958,Kenny,(You guys don't understand! My dad is one of the strikers!) [walks away]

23,8,Turd Burglars,93725,Kenny,(Yeah. He'll do anything.) [Kyle did not appreciate that] 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93736,Kenny,(TO-MORROW!) 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93741,Kenny,Got it. [brings it over] 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93743,Kenny,[a few seconds later] She's not flushing. 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93849,Kenny,"[thinking, ""Why did I agree to this? I don't even have a machine to play Fallen Order on.""] "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94222,Kenny,[after a few seconds] (What's that?!) [a snow mobile is heard in the distance and it gets louder] 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94864,Kenny,(You can talk.) 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94883,Kenny,"(What do you mean, dude?) "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94981,Kenny,"[sighs] (I've been having a lot of problems with my friends. It just seems like the pandemic exposed problems we didn't even know were there. To be honest, I'm not sure that I even see a future with these guys.) "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95093,Kenny,[steps in between them to calm them] (You guys stop it! Stop it!) [outside Cartman's window a man is heard singing] 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95127,Kenny,(We're actually gonna sleep here?) 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95134,Kenny,(Yeah?) 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95184,Kenny,"[walking into the doorway] (Hey, guys, what's going on?) "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95187,Kenny,(Okay.) [he walks away] 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95255,Kenny,"(What? No, I wanna hear this!) "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95257,Kenny,"(Yeah, okay.) [he takes the iPad and walks away] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95302,Kenny,"[he looks up from his iPad] (Yeah, what's going on?) "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95304,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's fine, but I --) "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95358,Kenny,(What are you guys talking about?) 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95361,Kenny,(Huh?) 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96303,Kenny,(Yeah!! Woo-hoo!) 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96312,Kenny,(That was fucking great!)

25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96465,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's really beautiful.) "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96505,Kenny,(And completely insensitive! What's going to happen when you grow up?! You have to learn responsibility!)

26,1,Cupid Ye,96866,Kenny,(Woah.) 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96877,Kenny,"(Well, not this time.) [walks away] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97077,Kenny,"(Aaaaghagaah!!!) [Kenny runs away from the bathroom, scared.] "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97166,Kenny,"(Sweet drip, dude!) "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97172,Kenny,"(Haha, yeah, sweet drip, dude.) "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98084,Kenny,"(Jesus Christ, dude!) "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98086,Kenny,(You had a job?) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98088,Kenny,(Why the fuck would we open a restaurant?) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98090,Kenny,(Whoa.) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98100,Kenny,(The fuck?) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98106,Kenny,(Yeah!) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98114,Kenny,[laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98117,Kenny,[laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98120,Kenny,[laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98124,Kenny,"(Uh, let me see. Where did we put those?) "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98133,Kenny,[laughs] 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98184,Kenny,"(I don't know, dude.) "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98196,Kenny,(Whoa!) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98198,Kenny,(Sorry to hear that.) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98202,Kenny,(What?) 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98216,Kenny,"(Hey, guys.) "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98240,Kenny,(Alright!) 
13,2,The Coon,62473,M,"[this hero wears an M on his shirt and a ? on his hood] I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs. "
13,2,The Coon,62475,M,Nuh uh. 
13,2,The Coon,62477,M,I am Mysterion. 
13,2,The Coon,62479,Mysterion,"I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know. "
13,2,The Coon,62481,Mysterion,"I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat. "
13,2,The Coon,62483,Mysterion,I really don't care who you are. 
13,2,The Coon,62485,Mysterion,Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman? 
13,2,The Coon,62487,Mysterion,I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. [leaps off the roof and out of view] 
13,2,The Coon,62527,Mysterion,"[voice over] I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime. [a shot of City Hall. Mysterion appears on the roof by the dome] I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe. [he leaps off the roof and soon climbs up a rain gutter] Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. [climbs in through a window ...into the police station.] "
13,2,The Coon,62530,Mysterion,There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again. 
13,2,The Coon,62534,Mysterion,This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will- 
13,2,The Coon,62537,Mysterion,I don't have time for this. [brings out some fireworks and lights the fuse. He drops the fireworks on the ground and leaves. They pop up and deter the Coon from following him. When the smoke clears the Coon looks around and doesn't see anyone.] 
13,2,The Coon,62579,Mysterion,[on Kyle's bed] Hello Kyle. 
13,2,The Coon,62581,Mysterion,Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm. 
13,2,The Coon,62583,Mysterion,Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity. 
13,2,The Coon,62585,Mysterion,"[turns away from Kyle] I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating. "
13,2,The Coon,62587,Mysterion,Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. [looks over his shoulder. Kyle just stands there.] 
13,2,The Coon,62614,Mysterion,"Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos! "
13,2,The Coon,62640,Mysterion,What next time? 
13,2,The Coon,62643,Mysterion,"Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself. "
13,2,The Coon,62649,Mysterion,"No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. [the camera zooms in on him as he gets ready to remove his mask. As soon as he shows his eyes and nose, the camera stops] "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68627,Mysterion,Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends? 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68629,Mysterion,"Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68647,Mysterion,My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf! 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68709,Mysterion,Agreed. 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68713,Mysterion,"We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk! "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68719,Mysterion,Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways. 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68763,Mysterion,He means we need to discuss things with you! 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68765,Mysterion,"Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him! "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68772,Mysterion,But we get the headquarters and all the equipment. 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68774,Mysterion,We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? [she walks in and approaches Mysterion] 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68776,Mysterion,Please escort the Coon out of our secret base. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68811,Mysterion,"I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school. [the book opens to a random page. On that page he is defeating Professor Chaos] For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone. [a picture of the oil rig, updating every few seconds to show the spread of the oil slick] The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68813,Mysterion,"But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68815,Mysterion,"Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68817,Mysterion,"I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! [a swarm of ?'s flies around the screen, and the name of the episode appears] "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68820,Mysterion,"Thank you, ma'am. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68823,Mysterion,We believe that every little bit helps. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68827,Mysterion,Mysterion! 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68834,Mysterion,"Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that [chuckles] extremely funny. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68859,Mysterion,"I don't know, but I think we'd better find out. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68865,Mysterion,Not Cartman. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68867,Mysterion,Whoever did this to our base was looking for something. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68877,Mysterion,Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?! 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68880,Mysterion,"Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you! "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68882,Mysterion,"Please sir, put down the gun. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68886,Mysterion,"Then do it! [walks right up to the pistol and places himself at the end of the barrel] Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy! "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68888,Mysterion,You guys go! I'll deal with this prick! 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68891,Mysterion,I said it's fine! Just go! [the other boys leave] 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68897,Mysterion,"People need you, Hindsight! [Hindsight takes a swig of Macallan] Without you they feel helpless and stupid. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68899,Mysterion,"You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker! [turns around. Hindsight, curious, turns to face him] Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68901,Mysterion,"[turns around] I can't die. [pauses] I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes. [turns away] And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, ""Oh hey Kenny."" Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes. [faces Hindsight] You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68907,Mysterion,[voice-over] What should I do? [shown getting a massage] Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers? 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68911,Mysterion,[in a familiar alley] Maybe I should just... disappear. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68923,Mysterion,"[away from the group, in deep thought] I'm fine. "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68925,Mysterion,So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68927,Mysterion,"Uhh, what? [goes to see. He looks at the screen and his expression changes to one of dismay. His parents are pictured getting arrested along with the creepy man and Mr. Adler, shop teacher, among others. In his normal voice] What the fuck?! I m-I mean, [going into his superhero voice] Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! [takes over as Human Kite leaves the chair] "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68940,Mysterion,I'm not here about that. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68942,Mysterion,Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68945,Mysterion,Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! [the parents look at each other] 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68947,Mysterion,What happened at those meetings? 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68949,Mysterion,I don't find that hard to believe at all. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68951,Mysterion,These people still meet? Where? 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68961,Mysterion,There must be clubs like this all over the world. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68967,Mysterion,Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth. 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68981,Mysterion,"[jumps off the roof and lands on the alley floor, on one knee] What does it mean? ""That is not dead which can eternal lie""? "
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68983,Mysterion,What does it mean?! 
14,12,Mysterion Rises,68986,Mysterion,[rises and walks towards them] You're going to tell me everything you know! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69034,Mysterion,[with his back to the group] I can't die! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69036,Mysterion,"No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die! "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69038,Mysterion,"[turns to face them] Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed ""Oh my God,"" and you called him a bastard! "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69040,Mysterion,All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69042,Mysterion,Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69045,Mysterion,[turns away] I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys. 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69047,Mysterion,[confronts him] Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69049,Mysterion,"It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me! [walks away, then turns around] Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! [pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head] "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69075,Mysterion,"You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you? "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69077,Mysterion,What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from. 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69082,Mysterion,Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69104,Mysterion,What are you doing with that thing?! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69114,Mysterion,"I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. [huge butterfly-like creatures pop up from behind some plants] "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69124,Mysterion,"Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. [moves away from the cliff] "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69127,Mysterion,"I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. [runs towards the cliff] "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69129,Mysterion,Ow! That fucking HURTS! [moans a few times and dies.] 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69145,Mysterion,How to I fight him? [the Goth kids look at the window and see him there] 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69147,Mysterion,That god you pray to just took away all my friends. 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69149,Mysterion,How do I fight him?! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69151,Mysterion,Tell me what that means! [the bedroom door opens and Henrietta's mom appears] 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69162,Mysterion,Old Ones? 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69165,Mysterion,That's it! That's the place I just was! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69169,Mysterion,And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die? 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69176,Mysterion,Wherever Cthulhu is! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69178,Mysterion,"Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers. "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69180,Mysterion,You don't understand! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69191,Mysterion,"Hey, fat boy! "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69193,Mysterion,To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars! [approaches him] You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69195,Mysterion,"You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU! "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69197,Mysterion,For you! You're making it a better place for you! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69199,Mysterion,No! This is what superheroes do! [walks up to Cthulhu] You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?! [that gets Cthulhu's attention] Bring back my friends! Take me! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69201,Mysterion,"[to Mintberry Crunch] Only an immortal can kill another immortal! [to Cthulhu] Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy! "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69203,Mysterion,"Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss! "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69205,Mysterion,No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back! 
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69207,Mysterion,"Come back, you fat piece of shit! [notices something in the sky. Others notice too. A bright object descends onto the parking lot and dims enough to reveal a giant oval shaped light that serves as a holograph. An image of a man appears inside and begins to talk. Mysterion is puzzled] "
14,13,Coon vs. Coon & Friends,69229,Mysterion,"Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. [takes a gun out and just shoots himself in the head. The other boys jump back in shock.] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72806,Mysterion,"You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that! "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72808,Mysterion,"[thinks a moment] Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72810,Mysterion,"You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand? "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72812,Mysterion,"Don't try, Karen. Do. [the bedroom light comes on] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72891,Mysterion,How about you find another little girl to pick on? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72893,Mysterion,[pulling Jessica's head up by her hair] Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! [drops some Chinese fireworks as a distraction while he takes Karen up to the roof.]
