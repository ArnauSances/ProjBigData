5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32171,Butters,"A drive? Oh, boy! [puts his fists together twice] I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too? "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32173,Butters,"[hops off his dad's lap] Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad. [walks out after his mother] Oh boy, a drive! "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32175,Butters,"Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along. "

5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32179,Butters,"Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself. "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32181,Butters,"Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? [begins searching] It's cold out here. "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32183,Butters,"Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then. [she moves the gear shift to neutral, releases the emergency brake, opens the driver-side door, and exits. She walks away from the water, and the car starts to move forward] You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom. [cut to a view of the water from the dock] Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water. "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32185,Butters,"[a view of the dock from the water] Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water! [she turns away as the car leaves the dock] Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! [she walks away] "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32188,Butters,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me! 
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32213,Butters,"Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now. [the car floats down some more and crashes into some boulders. The passenger-side door flies open] Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt. [unfastens it and lets it go. He scrambles out and over the boulders] Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home. [before him are some low hills and the Rockies in the background.

5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32229,Butters,"And so then my friend started hollerin' at me, sayin' ""you took my rubber bands."" Well, I didn't take 'em, Craig, did. I saw Craig take 'em. Anyway, boy, I sure am lucky you came along, Mister. "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32231,Butters,"Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now. [dream sequence: the doors open and the family walks in] We'll walk in the front doors, [a smiling waitress welcomes them and leads them to their booth] and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth [Butters focuses on the booth bench, runs to it, and climbs on] Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers. [a waiter brings the dish over] Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers [he gets a tie, she gets the paint brush, and they smile at the gifts] Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing  Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's [the entire staff sings at the table as the family listens] Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's [the sequence is cut short as the driver gets annoyed] Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's [the truck stops and the driver exits to make his way to the passenger side] Happy Ha-   Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk? [the driver opens the door, plucks Butters out, set him by the side of the road, closes the door, and heads back for the driver's side. He gets in and drives off. Butters watches him go, then turns to face the receding truck...] He must like TGI Fridays "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32236,Butters,"Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this? "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32238,Butters,"Uh, is this the Stotch residence? "

5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32304,Butters," ...Bennigan's. You'll love all our... shenanigans. [the eerie sound is heard again, and three red dots are aimed at his forehead - he has been targeted by someone, or something... He turns right again and looks into the trees. Someone looks back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is shown. Butters turns left and start walking again. The three dots remain trained on his forehead] Oh, nutsack [moves his hands to his mouth and gasps a bit] Oops.   "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32307,Butters,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!

5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32332,Butters,"Now gosh darn it, you! [steps in between his parents] You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble! [Chris and Linda listen] Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here [puts his right hand to his chin, palm down] with you two! [a few seconds of silence follow] "

Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay. "

5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32364,Butters,"Wuh comin', Dad! [goes inside the house] "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32366,Butters,[returns to the doorway and points to himself with his thumb] That's me! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32380,Butters,"Uh, hey, fellas. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32382,Butters,"[upset] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32386,Butters,"[excited] Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32389,Butters,"[angered] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32391,Butters,Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. [follows the other three. The phone remains on the floor] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32404,Butters,"Wow, Jared! "

6,1,Jared Has Aides,32436,Butters,"Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32441,Butters,"But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32443,Butters,You mean like Jared? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32445,Butters,[angrily] Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32451,Butters,[beaming] Wow. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32476,Butters,"Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32478,Butters,"[self-conscious] Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32481,Butters,"Ugh. [sets his plate down] Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more. "

6,1,Jared Has Aides,32492,Butters,No! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32515,Butters,"W-well, k-kinda like Cartman. [Cartman slaps Butters and shakes him] Aw! "

6,1,Jared Has Aides,32571,Butters,Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.

6,1,Jared Has Aides,32579,Butters,"Uh, I don't know about this, fellas. "

6,1,Jared Has Aides,32610,Butters,Yes sir. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32612,Butters,"Four times, mom. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32614,Butters,"Yes, sir. [rises and... struggles. He falls off the coffee table to the floor. Stephen isn't fazed, but Linda is affected] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32629,Butters,Uh- go where? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32631,Butters,"I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. [lifts his shorts to show the bandage over the scar] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32633,Butters,"Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32635,Butters,"[counts off] Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?! [moves his hands palms down to wash his hands of any more trouble] Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32639,Butters,"Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32641,Butters,No- but you don't sound like me. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32730,Butters,"Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded. [gasps] Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! [rushes away] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32732,Butters,"Huh. Huh, uh, uh. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32734,Butters,[nervous] Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32736,Butters,"Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32738,Butters,Hu-oh! Goody!

6,2,Asspen,32811,Butters,"Hey, do you guys smell that? "
6,2,Asspen,32813,Butters,"Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. [Cartman chuckles] "
6,2,Asspen,32816,Butters,"Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo. "
6,2,Asspen,32821,Butters,So where's the part where we have a good time? 
6,2,Asspen,32823,Butters,"Wuh, that's my face, sir. "
6,2,Asspen,32825,Butters,"Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas? "
6,2,Asspen,32915,Butters,"Do you think Stan has a chance? [the countdown begins. The chutes open and Tad takes off. Stan moves along allowing, sticking to the basic moves] Uh go Stan! [Tad flies down the hill, banking and weaving throughout. Stan appears a few seconds later, going down carefully] "
6,2,Asspen,32919,Butters,"U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you. "
6,2,Asspen,32952,Butters,"Let's dance. [begins to dance. Cartman watches with dismay. Butters does a bunch of dance moves, including the Moonwalk and some break-dancing] "
6,2,Asspen,32977,Butters,"Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan? "
6,2,Asspen,33038,Butters,"Come on, Stan! [Tad is shown zipping down the hill, Stan is still at the summit making his way down] "

6,3,Freak Strike,33079,Butters,"And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither! [takes off the coat and tosses it away] I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33081,Butters,"Oh, all right, then. [takes a seat on the sofa between Kyle and Cartman] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33109,Butters,"Oh, that'd be awesome! [Cartman dials the number] "

6,3,Freak Strike,33173,Butters,"[hesitant] Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. [heads for the gate, then turns around. The boys wave at him. Butters looks down, then walks into the plane.] "

6,3,Freak Strike,33223,Butters,"[forgetting why he's supposedly made of] They sure do. They always say to me, ""Butters, you're not Kenny."" But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that- "
6,3,Freak Strike,33225,Butters,"I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it. "

Slowly, Stan reaches up for the knob and turns it. The door flies open and a torrent of blood gushes through the door, flooding the boys back into the street.] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34153,Butters,I'm sure! There's no way! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34155,Butters,"Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter. "

6,6,Professor Chaos,34204,Butters,"[joining the three] Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34206,Butters,"Wuh well, sure. [They all go before Cartman's desk. Cartman takes a seat behind the desk. Stan helps Butters to his seat, then takes a place at Cartman's right side Kyle is on Cartman's left.] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34208,Butters,Wull what is it? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34210,Butters,"Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34212,Butters,Not working out? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34216,Butters,"Well, but ah I can get better. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34219,Butters,Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34221,Butters,"Please, fellas, uh don't fire me. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34230,Butters,"[angrily] The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them. [turns around and sits on his bed, wistfully] And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others. [the shadow on the wall turns into that of an old humpbacked man] Fine! [hops off the bed determined to do something about it] If I am to be an outcast, so be it! [walks towards the camera] I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it! [moves to his left] From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me! [an image of a nuclear blast going off as people run from it] I will become the greatest supervillain [people run as danger comes from the sky] the world has ever seen! [a tsunami takes over a harbor town as a woman and baby flee it] Where I go, destruction will follow! [exults at his new destiny, raising arms and face towards heaven as lightning strikes. A shot of the exterior with more lightning] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34232,Butters,"Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! [grins devilishly] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34234,Butters,"Hu-uh, okay Mom. [waits a few moments, then gets that devilish look again.] Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now. [turns and faces the camera out side once more] Tomorrow, the chaos begins. [begins to laugh softly, then harder, than more maniacally, then in full maniacal laughter] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34244,Butters,"I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! [cackles once again and runs out of the restaurant. The diners resume their eating after a few seconds.] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34263,Butters,Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! [the dog slowly kneels and Butters walks off cackling at his success] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34265,Butters,"Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos! [walks up to his dresser drawer and messes up some shirts in there, then closes the drawer and laughs] And that's only the beginning! [laughs evilly] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34281,Butters,"[takes a a seat at the table] It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order at Bennigan's. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34283,Butters,"Yeh, you didn't? [leaves his seat and walks to the living room] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34285,Butters,"Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick? "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34287,Butters,"[getting mad] Nothing. [turns the next page] Nothing! [closes the paper and stands up] It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to step it up a notch! [makes two fists signaling his stepped-up efforts] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34299,Butters,"[thinking] Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth. [a shot of Butters using a shovel to bury the eraser] And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser. [Butters' desk moves around so the camera can see the kids looking for the eraser] And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! [the times table floats behind Butters and gets all jumbled up as he speaks, finally ending in a kid whose brains blow out of his head] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34301,Butters,"[thwarted, begins to think again. The people around him take on their picture-negative counterparts] So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34303,Butters,Ms. Choksondik? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34305,Butters,"Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34307,Butters,"[opens the door, then looks back] Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34314,Butters,"[enters cackling] The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! [approaches Ms. Choksondik] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34316,Butters,"I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! [turns, takes the other eraser, and walks out cackling, closing the door. The class just looks at the door] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34318,Butters,"Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34320,Butters,"Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow. [raises his right elbow] Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look. [as Ms. Choksondik looks at the elbow, the shadow and sneer return to Butters' face. He begins to think] Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34329,Butters,"It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world. [puts glue on some aluminum, puts the aluminum on a hamster] There we go. [the hamsters will be armored, as he is. He places the hamster back in the cage] Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos. [the hamsters begin to make noise] Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon. [the door opens and Butters quickly throws a blanket over his hamster cage] Aaahhh! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34331,Butters,A note? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34333,Butters,"Okay, Mom. [takes a look at the envelope, spins around in his chair, and opens the envelope. He reads the letter within: ""I know who you are. The South Park Docks. 7:30. Tonight""] So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions! [pulls off the blanket] We haven't much time! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34354,Butters,"[drops his guard and steps out] Oh, hey Dougie. [gets into character] Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34356,Butters,"Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise! [pulls out two hamsters from his pockets and sets them down] Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down! [the hamsters head back towards shore] Aw minions, naw, not that way. He- [turns to see them leave] come back minions. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34358,Butters,Join me? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34360,Butters,But why? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34362,Butters,"Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34364,Butters,"Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34366,Butters,"Now let us go look for my minions! [softly] They ran away here, now to find 'em... [the new villainous duo search the docks for the hamsters] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34391,Butters,"People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos, [Dougie comes into view] and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my final Labor of Loathing! I am going to... flood... the world! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34395,Butters,"Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth! [Dougie goes to the faucet by the porch and turns it on, then brings the hose to Butters. Butters addresses the world] You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! [points at the pool of water now forming on the ground. The crowd watches in silence] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34400,Butters,"Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle! [the two of them watch the hose yield its water, seemingly slowly] Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? [Dougie goes to look, then returns] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34402,Butters,"Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die! [cackles and dances around, then resumes watching the puddle grow. Day fades to night] Boy, this sure is takin' a long time. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34425,Butters,"Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34427,Butters,"Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer. [the sound of vehicles screeching to a stop outside the yard] Hey, who is that? [on the street, two Water Department vans come to a stop. Four men, two from each van, step out and get their tools. They enter the yard and approach the hose] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34430,Butters,"Heeyyy, what are you doin'? [Worker 1 finishes and the workers leave, climb into their vans, and drive off. Professor Chaos and General Disarray look on in sad disbelief. Suddenly, Butters flares up] Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34432,Butters,"[softly, pensive] Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but- [with anger growing] but now they have left me with no other choice! "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34438,Butters,"This is it, General Disarray. My final solution. [cut to a view of the town from said hill. ] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34440,Butters,"Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays! [reaches into the box and withdraws a spray can] Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos! [begins spraying away. The can empties without discernible effect, and Butters tosses it down] Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. [Dougie reaches in the box and takes out three cans. He gives one to Butters and keeps the other two. Butters quickly opens the can and sprays away, cackling all the while. Dougie opens his two cans and begins spraying as well, cackling along with Butters. The camera begins to zoom out] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34451,Butters,"[happens by and waves] Hey, fellas. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34453,Butters,How are things... going with your new best friend? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34458,Butters,"Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. [takes his leave, screen left. Stan and Kyle resume work on the snowman] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34478,Butters,"[in the doorway] Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework. [he enters and closes the door behind him. His evil face shows] Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT... [runs to his closet and opens the sliding door, then steps inside] nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside... [slides the door shut and changes clothes. He slides the door open and comes out dressed as] Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! [runs to his window, opens it, and jumps out. He skulks through the woods nearby with an easel. He reaches a clearing and sets up the easel. General Disarray shows up pulling a wagon of firewood] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34480,Butters,"Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34482,Butters,"Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. [EVIL PLOT #4-B] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34484,Butters,"Simple, my dear general. [flips the page over to show a drawing of the town with a huge shade over the town, held up by a tall pillar] We are going to block out the sun! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34486,Butters,"Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide [a hamster peers from the wood and drops back down again], precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34488,Butters,"Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! [laughs with evil glee] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34490,Butters,[tilts his head forward] Huh? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34492,Butters,"He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34494,Butters,"Aww, I don't wanna do it now [drops his hammer], not if they already did it on the Simpsons. [walks off dejected] I have to think of something else. [they walk through the woods] Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34522,Butters,"General Disarray, are your parents home? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34524,Butters,"Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34526,Butters,"You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head! [pulls the cover off and laughs maniacally] Hahahahaa, yeah! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34528,Butters,"Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! [turns on the TV] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34530,Butters,Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34532,Butters,"I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34537,Butters,"Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34539,Butters,Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34541,Butters,[walks away hanging his head] Stupid Simpsons... 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34578,Butters,"Wokay, how about this, Dougie? [backs up to the easel. On it is the schematic to plan #123-D] I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money. [Dougie just looks back] No? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34580,Butters,"Wokay [flips to the next page to show #124-A], then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumors about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their- "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34582,Butters,[flips to plan #129-E] I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen- 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34613,Butters,Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the- 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34615,Butters,[flips to plan #125-E] Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that- 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34617,Butters,[seethes for a few seconds] Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! [sits down next to Dougie] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34619,Butters,Dwaah!! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34658,Butters,"I've done it, General Disarray. I've watched all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold! [pulls the sheet off] This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise. [grins] People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey! [begins to cackle. Dougie fiddles with the machine] You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34660,Butters,Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34662,Butters,"Nnno [turns and faces the TV], uh no, no, it can't be. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34664,Butters,No! No! [begins hallucinating] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34666,Butters,Aaaaah! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34668,Butters,Oh sweet Jesus! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34687,Butters,"Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34689,Butters,"Waaaah! [starts to run again, and the school bus pulls up. Butters hails it down.] Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! [the door opens and Butters steps on] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34691,Butters,[jumps backwards] Haaah! [ends up on his back on the sidewalk as the bus pulls away] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34694,Butters,[runs back the other way] Aaah! Nooo! [Chef and Garrison look at each other] 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34719,Butters,[spots their altered appearance] Haaa! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34721,Butters,Cartman? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34729,Butters,[sensing a chance to retort] Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34731,Butters,"They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it starts to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34738,Butters,"Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter. [smiles. Everything before him is back in South Park-style] Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34741,Butters,[heads for the door] I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! [runs out of the room. Dougie stays behind] 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34788,Butters,Compassionate. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34793,Butters,"You mean, like a goldfish? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35387,Butters,"[pipes up behind Annie] Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? [Bebe continues writing] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35406,Butters,"[Stan and Kyle part a bit for a better view] Wuuhh, it's really fun. You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35429,Butters,Cool! [close up] That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35447,Butters,[points] Uh there comes an SUV. [Tolkien throws a rock and hits the SUV] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35456,Butters,Me too! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35552,Butters,[puts his fists on his hips] Stupider than Bebe! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35555,Butters,"Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35557,Butters,Yeah! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35559,Butters,Uhyep! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35602,Butters,[moves forward] Then we gotta work on your campaign. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35739,Butters,"[steps up and touches the left breast] Oooo, they're all hard and oogey! "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35999,Butters,"Huh, I'm over here, Dad. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36371,Butters,"[rushes up to meet his parents] Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36373,Butters,"Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36375,Butters,Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. [the video begins to play. A man and a woman are heard] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36377,Butters,"Whoa. [more sounds from the video] Neat-o. [more sounds, a few spankings] Well, this is good. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36399,Butters,"Oh golly. [his legs part and he points to his crotch] Hey, what's happening down there? [the basement door is heard opening and closing. Butters is fascinated by his body's reaction. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come down the stairs. Butters reaches for his crotch for tactile inspection] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36401,Butters,"[walks up to Kyle] Wha-wha, what are you doing?! [Kyle removes it and puts it into the LotR case it came in] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36403,Butters,"But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36406,Butters,"Bwaagghh! [falls on his face, then quickly gets up and retreats] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36408,Butters,"Well, then... then let me go with you. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36410,Butters,"Wuh, okay. [Butters jumps on Kyle's left arm and starts making love to it] Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36412,Butters,"[a bit surprised] Playing Lord of the Rings. [resumes the love-making] Ugh, wegh, oh yeah. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36414,Butters,"[on hands and knees, with renewed determination] Let me have the tape! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36416,Butters,My movie! [sorrowfully reaches out for it with left hand] My awesome cool movie. My... precious. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36451,Butters,"[peeks out from behind the sofa, in the shadow, then speaks in a raspy voice] The precious? [his parents turn to see him] Could you bring back my precious? "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36453,Butters,"[crawls out into view] They took his precious, took it away to watch without him. [sits up and puts his hands on his knees] He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36484,Butters,[pops up outside and taps on a window] Precious. [the adults turn to see the window] Let me see my precious. [slides down the window and out of view] Plee-ee-ee-ease! [the adults just look on] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36586,Butters,The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36614,Butters,[crawls up to them] The Butters knowses.

6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36618,Butters,"First, just let Butters sseee the precious. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36622,Butters,[puts up his arms to shield himself] Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters. [squats with his arms hanging over his knees] We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. [walks forward in a squatting manner] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36649,Butters,[now moving] Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! [jumps on Kyle and runs off with the tape] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36651,Butters,[now in the middle of the parking lot] Now wees hases it! [the sixth graders close in]

6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36687,Butters,[rises from the batch of videotapes that buried him] Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it... 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36717,Butters,"Where is Mr. Hat, sir? "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36772,Butters,[sees a third exhibit] W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. [walks over to it. The others follow] 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36808,Butters,It evaporates. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36812,Butters,Sure. [smiles and goes to get Lemmiwinks] 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36816,Butters,[realizing what just happened] Lemmiwinks? NO! 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36866,Butters,[still distraught] But they killed Lemmiwinks!

6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37431,Butters,"Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37433,Butters,"Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37435,Butters,"I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37437,Butters,"I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. [Stan is surprised by this account] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37439,Butters,Oh. I guess it's been about four months now. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37441,Butters,Nobody asked. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37443,Butters,Probably watching Becker. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37446,Butters,"See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,- "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37450,Butters,"Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school. [an air of determination appears] I need to learn to behave myself! [Stan crosses his arms and gets mad, then bolts for the door] Hey! Where are you going, Stan? [follows Stan out.] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37453,Butters,"Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37455,Butters,"Well we both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37457,Butters,I don't follow. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37459,Butters,[excitedly] Oh! Are we out for an adventure? [follows Stan out] 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37462,Butters,"[turns away. Stan stops right at the entrance] I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37464,Butters,"Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? [follows Stan in and closes the door.] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37482,Butters,"Yeah, I can't believe it! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37484,Butters,"This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this? [thinks about this a minute. Stan lowers his eyelids to half-closed as he realizes Butters is still clueless] Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37486,Butters,"Eh, but then why did they come back to the past. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37488,Butters,Oh... Oohhhh. [Stan rolls his eyes] But that's like they're lyin'. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37490,Butters,"Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37492,Butters,"You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37494,Butters,"Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! [heads off. This time, Stan follows] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37496,Butters,"Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. [slides his closet door open, steps inside the closet, and slides the door shut] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37498,Butters,[jumps out of the closet and cackles] Now you know my terrible secret! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37500,Butters,"Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37502,Butters,"[walks downtrodden to the mirror and looks at himself] Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37504,Butters,How about this? Winter Park. It looks kinda nice. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37506,Butters,"Wow, look at this, Stan. [reads from the paper] ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."" "

6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37512,Butters,This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37514,Butters,"[rises on his knees] Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37516,Butters,"Hooray! [follows him out] And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37526,Butters,You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37535,Butters,Yeah!

6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37638,Butters,"Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37640,Butters,"Uh but Cartman! Wait! [once Cartman and crew leave, Butters faces the front door] Oh Christmas! [the door opens and Stan enters] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37642,Butters,"Oh, Stan! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37644,Butters,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37646,Butters,We are? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37650,Butters,"[squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his hands] Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now. "

7,11,Casa Bonita,41410,Butters,"[rises, catches his breath, and dusts himself off] Finally I can breathe a- [looks at the apparent devastation around him] Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left. [walks forth] Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello? [rustling sounds are heard and he tenses up in fear, then softly] Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals. [more loudly] Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am? [he watches, and a dog emerges from the rubble] Oh. Aww, it's a little dog. [approaches the mutt] Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. [walks into the rubble and begins his work] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41421,Butters,"[off-screen] You take away the biggest part of me. [the worker listens, then goes to the source of the sound] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go. [hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan... "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41423,Butters,[quickly arms himself with the broom] HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41425,Butters,"You're not a cannibal, are you? "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41427,Butters,"Oh. [drops the broom and smiles] Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41429,Butters,"I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look. [moves off to his left, she follows. They pass a row of makeshift buildings that he built overnight] This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this [a statue that reads Cartman under it] is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh? [promptly unzips and drops his pants, then steps forward.] I'm ready whenever you are. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41431,Butters,"Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best! "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41433,Butters,"[looks at her for a long time, then looks towards the town] Oh... [realizes he's been tricked, he looks down and pulls up his pants.] Ma'am, can I use your phone? "

7,14,Raisins,42171,Butters,[approaches] Lexus! [she takes a few steps back] 
7,14,Raisins,42173,Butters,I waited all night for you to get off work. 
7,14,Raisins,42175,Butters,I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you. 
7,14,Raisins,42180,Butters,"Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present. "
7,14,Raisins,42182,Butters,"It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. [tries to get closer, but Maury holds him back] "
7,14,Raisins,42184,Butters,"[tries to get closer, but Maury him back] Well yeah, but, but, hey, [tries to get closer, but Maury him back] hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime. "
7,14,Raisins,42186,Butters,O-kay! 
7,14,Raisins,42188,Butters,"Bye, bye darling! [Maury turns and goes back to the restaurant. Butters holds his hands over his heart] Wow... a real-life relationship. "
7,14,Raisins,42215,Butters,Hi! Is Lexus here? 
7,14,Raisins,42217,Butters,Darling! 
7,14,Raisins,42219,Butters,[hugs back] Oh God. I missed you so much. 
7,14,Raisins,42241,Butters,"[seated on his bed in his room. A picture of Lexus is taped to his wall next to the window. The action switches back and forth] Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. [Lexus happens to walk by, and Porsche hands her the phone.] "
7,14,Raisins,42243,Butters,Hey Lexus. 
7,14,Raisins,42245,Butters,"Wuh it's me, Butters. "
7,14,Raisins,42247,Butters,"I'm fine. I miss you though. [lays on his back, getting comfortable] Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz. [shot of Lexus pouring lemonade into a pitcher] Sometimes I think our classes are too hard. [back to Butters' room] But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going? "
7,14,Raisins,42249,Butters,"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD. "
7,14,Raisins,42251,Butters,"Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times. "
7,14,Raisins,42253,Butters,"Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money "
7,14,Raisins,42255,Butters,"Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say. [Lexus has hung up and is walking away with her pitcher] Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you. [hangs up quickly and nervously] Heeheee, heh, Oh my God. "
7,14,Raisins,42257,Butters,"Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again. "
7,14,Raisins,42259,Butters,Uh but I spent it all. 
7,14,Raisins,42261,Butters,On my girlfriend. 
7,14,Raisins,42264,Butters,"[bashfully, puts his hands behind his back] Yeah. "
7,14,Raisins,42266,Butters,Yup! 
7,14,Raisins,42269,Butters,"Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone. [holds a cautionary finger] But don't embarrass me or nothin'. [lowers it] I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you. "
7,14,Raisins,42271,Butters,Okay. [walks off] 
7,14,Raisins,42298,Butters,"Here we are, Mom and Dad! [they enter, but his parents are immediately troubled by the setting] "
7,14,Raisins,42300,Butters,"Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her. "
7,14,Raisins,42307,Butters,"Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! [runs off. Stephen and Linda take their seats] "
7,14,Raisins,42319,Butters,Mom? Dad? This is Lexus. 
7,14,Raisins,42322,Butters,Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me [holds on to Lexus] you can say in front of Lexus. 
7,14,Raisins,42324,Butters,Huh? 
7,14,Raisins,42326,Butters,"Oh, I see. [gets angry] You don't approve of my girlfriend! [Lexus looks off and smiles at somebody] Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad! [walks away from the table with Lexus] Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint! "
7,14,Raisins,42328,Butters,"... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore? "
7,14,Raisins,42330,Butters,So that's it? We're broken up now? 
7,14,Raisins,42332,Butters,Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over. [walks off dejected] Our relationship is o-over. 
7,14,Raisins,42338,Butters,"Oh [sniff, wipes away his tears] Uh hey, hey Stan. "
7,14,Raisins,42340,Butters,"[sobbing] Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me. "
7,14,Raisins,42342,Butters,Yeah. [sniff] It sure does hurt. 
7,14,Raisins,42345,Butters,"Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life. "
7,14,Raisins,42347,Butters,"Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, [sobs] it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid... "
7,14,Raisins,42350,Butters,"Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. [walks off] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42742,Butters,Hey fellas. What's happenin'? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42744,Butters,"Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42748,Butters,"I think I'd make a really good ninja. [turns right and walks off towards home, rejected] Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. [opens the front door and enters] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42750,Butters,I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person- 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42752,Butters,"Hi Mom. [walks upstairs] -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude. [enters his room and heads for the closet] And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil. [enters the closet] Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time! [one swoosh of his cape and he transforms] Professor Chaos! [he holds his hands some distance apart and a ball of energy appears. This electrifies his whole body] Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! [cackles. Now transformed, he makes his way downstairs. The stairs crack under his weight. He smashes his left fist into the wall, leaving a small crater in it. His mom looks on from the couch] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42754,Butters,"[in a gravelly voice] Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42756,Butters,"Well, o- okay Mom. [sees the pie on the small end table by the foot of the stairs and carries it off] Bah! Gah! [in his mind, he's big and powerful. Every step he takes affects the house. The first dislodges the family portrait, the second dislodges it more, the third knocks it to the ground. He opens the front door, goes out and slams it shot, knocking it off its hinges] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42769,Butters,Haaa ha ha ha ha! [he appears with energy bristling all around him] Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42772,Butters,[strikes a ground pose] Fools! [jumps into the air and more energy surges from him. A fireball appears between his hands] I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom! [closeup] Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42777,Butters,Nuh uh! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42779,Butters,Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42782,Butters,"Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding! [leaps up into the air and jumps back down, strikes the ground with his right fist, and the ground cracks towards the boys, ending with them being tossed into the air. The boys land on the ground again and look up at Butters] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! [two spiderwebs drop down and trap Stan and Kyle] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42788,Butters,Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42795,Butters,It hurts! It hurts! [continues to cry] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42798,Butters,"[trying to catch his breath] But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! [Butters continues to shriek in agonizing pain while Stan looks around nervously, with gritted teeth] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42807,Butters,[Stan tugs again] Ah. [Stan tugs harder] Hwa! [Stan tugs even harder] Hwaaaaa! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42810,Butters,You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! [whimpers] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42815,Butters,"Whoa, I'm getting woozy. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42823,Butters,"[sniffling] But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42829,Butters,"[between whimpers] Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42833,Butters,"Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42838,Butters,"[practices his bark unprompted] Wuhuff, woof, woof. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42843,Butters,"bu- but fellas, I gotta- [Cartman closes the door. Craig and his boys appear] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42879,Butters,"Hello? Anybody-eh. [the driver appears again and slows down to observe Butters. His right eyebrow rises] Woof. Woof. Woofwoof. [his voice softens] Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. [the drives speeds up and drives off. Butters turns and continues his lonely walk. Back near Skid Row the eight boys walk along searching for Butters.] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42906,Butters,"[moans, then opens his eyes] Woof woof. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42932,Butters,[in a gravelly voice] Woof woof. [babbles incoherently. The veterinarian leads him towards a cell] 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42934,Butters,Gaaaah! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42960,Butters,"[wanders on stage] Haba, haba! Habahoaha! [babbles some more, then falls flat on his back again] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43742,Butters,"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've- "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43744,Butters,"[turns around] Oh well, hi there everybody. [his mom leaves] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43746,Butters,"Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43748,Butters,...No. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43750,Butters,"No. [hops off the chair and runs away] No no no no no no, no! [runs into the living room and up the stairs] No! No no no no! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43755,Butters,[from his room] Waaaaah! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43762,Butters,"Aaaaah! [quickly throws the shoes and clippings away, then goes to cry into his pillow] Aaaaah! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43777,Butters,Two years ago. Two years ago! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43782,Butters,Whoops. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43786,Butters,Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [a man is trampled to death underfoot. Butters watches the auditorium empty out] No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43800,Butters,What do you want? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43802,Butters,"Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore. [leaves his chair and walks up to his Lego box] I gave that up. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43804,Butters,[rummaging for Lego blocks to take back to his desk] Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43806,Butters,"Yeah well, you tell that to their families. [returns to his desk with a new batch of blocks] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43808,Butters,"[whirls around] I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43810,Butters,What? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43812,Butters,[cups his hear so he hears no more] Aaaah! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43814,Butters,"Get out of my room, Stan. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43843,Butters,Hey! Can I still dance with you guys? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43854,Butters,"Waaah! [the spectators follow the shoe's arc. The shoe hits a stage light, which comes down and kills the OC leader. The OC coach comes forward] No! Jesus, not again! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43868,Butters,No! No! Noooooo! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43870,Butters,What the heck? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43872,Butters,"Whoa! What a huge package! [finds it, the shipping label reads] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43873,Butters,To Butters Stotch. Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me! [returns to the crate's label] 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43874,Butters,"Who is it from? ""Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."" [skips around] Wow! A package for me from Japan!! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43876,Butters,"Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43878,Butters,Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43881,Butters,[dazzled] Whoa... 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43883,Butters,[approaches AWESOM-O] You... you're my robot? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43885,Butters,Oh wow! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43887,Butters,Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43889,Butters,"Well I gotta go, Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43891,Butters,"Heheh, they're all so jealous! [He hops onto the bed next to Cartman.] I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43893,Butters,"Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh? [strokes his chin] Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesitated colon, which means I sometimes can't control my sphincter. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43895,Butters,"Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school. [Cartman begins to chuckle] You okay, AWESOM-O? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43897,Butters,"Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43899,Butters,"Hm, okay. Let's see [strokes his chin] Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43901,Butters,"Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43903,Butters,"Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43905,Butters,"No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play a trick on me ever again! [hops off and walks towards his desk.] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43907,Butters,"Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43909,Butters,"When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43911,Butters,Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43913,Butters,I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43915,Butters,"Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43917,Butters,"Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43919,Butters,How come? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43921,Butters,"Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. [leaves the room] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43924,Butters, Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43926,Butters," He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all. He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.   "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43928,Butters, My robot friend.   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43930,Butters, I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43932,Butters, He's smart as can be and emotion-free   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43934,Butters, And he's computed his way to my heart. My robot friend.   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43936,Butters, My robot friend.   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43938,Butters, My robot friend.   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43940,Butters, My robot... friend.   
8,5,AWESOM-O,43944,Butters,[leading Cartman to the stairs] That's great AWESOM-O! [Cartman carries a pile of clothes] You can carry all my laundry in one trip! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43946,Butters,"Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43948,Butters,"Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43951,Butters,"Yeah! Don't you know nothin' about robots? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! [Cartman follows Butters upstairs] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43955,Butters,"I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night! To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!  "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43957,Butters,Oh. Yeah. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43959,Butters,"[turns around carrying a box of suppositories] Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository. [takes one out and puts the box on the cabinet] Can you help me? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43961,Butters,Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on. 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43963,Butters,"[hops down from the stool] Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43965,Butters,"AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43967,Butters,"Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43970,Butters,"All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep. [POV changes from outside to bedroom overhead] Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo... "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43972,Butters,"Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye, [turns off the light] or what, or whatever robots have. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43976,Butters,AWESOM-O?! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43978,Butters,"AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43980,Butters,"Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43982,Butters,"Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43984,Butters,"Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43987,Butters,"Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together. [Butters and AWESOM-O are walking in a field] Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. [walks off] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43989,Butters,"[tickled] Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'. [tickled, turns away] Uh, heehee. [the doorbell rings] Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,43998,Butters,"[appears behind Cartman holding his glass of Sunny Delight] Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44001,Butters,"Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44003,Butters,"Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny quickly look to Cartman] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44005,Butters,"He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44009,Butters,[cheerfully] He's made in Japan! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44020,Butters,"[enters] AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! [Cartman moves to the refrigerator, Stephen and Linda enter] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44022,Butters,[overjoyed] Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44024,Butters,"Oh boy, [shakes Cartman's hand] AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! [hugs the ""robot""] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44029,Butters,Hi Aunt Nellie! [runs up to her and they hug each other] 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44031,Butters,"It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44033,Butters,"Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44037,Butters,"There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. [Cartman drops the suitcases] "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44044,Butters,"Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat. "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44047,Butters,[knocks on the door] AWESOM-O? 
8,5,AWESOM-O,44049,Butters,"Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go sightseein'! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44052,Butters, I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun We're two of a kind- That's me! And my robot friend. My robot friend. My robot friend.   
8,5,AWESOM-O,44054,Butters,"Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?! "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44056,Butters,"Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary. [Le Catamount Bistró] That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? [moves off] "

8,10,Pre-School,45485,Butters,"Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it- [stops and turns around. He's face to face with Trent. Butters begins talking nervously] Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while. "
8,10,Pre-School,45487,Butters,"Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids. [Trent is unmoved] Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it! "
8,10,Pre-School,45489,Butters,"Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'. "
8,10,Pre-School,45491,Butters,"No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through. "

8,11,Quest for Ratings,45759,Butters,"Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45761,Butters,[enunciates each word as he writes it] Lie about celebrities. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45767,Butters,"Oh, boy! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45771,Butters,"Sexy Action School News Team, ho! [the boys leave their seats and head out the doors. Cartman stops Tolkien] "

8,11,Quest for Ratings,45884,Butters,"Hey! Let's run naked through the street! [Butters rips off his clothes, except for his wig and runs away happily. Kyle, Tolkien, and Cartman stand around with goofy grins on their faces doing nothing.] "

8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46172,Butters,"Before what happens? [gets no answer, so looks around and sees her ""MY PETS"" photo album. He picks it up and leafs through it] "
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46174,Butters,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [throws the book away, gets out of the limo as fast as he can and runs away.] "

9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48378,Butters,"This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48381,Butters,"He says, he love you. [Cartman sobs] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48384,Butters,He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48386,Butters,"He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48389,Butters,"Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew. [Cartman sobs. Kyle looks, then gets annoyed] He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48393,Butters,He can't! Don't you understand?! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48395,Butters,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48397,Butters,"Uhh alright then. [Butters turns to follow, and Kyle is left looking puzzled] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48408,Butters,"[shuffles his right foot out of modesty] Aww, that's okay, Eric. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48410,Butters,So I won't see you again? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48412,Butters,Wow. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48414,Butters,Yeh you're still here. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48416,Butters,"Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48418,Butters,"Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48420,Butters,Did you ever do anything really bad? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48424,Butters,[writing] Broke fence... 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48426,Butters,"Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48428,Butters,"Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48433,Butters,Does this mean... you have to go now? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48435,Butters,Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48437,Butters,Eric! Calm down. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48440,Butters,I-I-it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48449,Butters,"[nervous, tries to look back] Lu lu lu, lu lu lu [the anal probe enters and shakes him violently] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48453,Butters,So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48455,Butters,Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48458,Butters,[relaxing and sleeps...] Ahhh. [...but Cartman appears at the foot of the bed] 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48460,Butters,AAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48462,Butters,"Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48464,Butters,"Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48466,Butters,Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48468,Butters,"[still with heavy eyelids] Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you? "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48470,Butters,"Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48474,Butters,Really? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48476,Butters,"Well, he's sittin' next to me right now. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48478,Butters,"Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48491,Butters,"Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48493,Butters,"Eric. [Cartman turns around] Well, be careful, ghost pal. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48509,Butters,"Hurry. Go, go! [the hostages leave quickly, quietly. They exit the Red Cross.] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48517,Butters,"Boy, we sure did. "

9,7,Erection Day,48600,Butters,"Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk. [they sit next to the boom box] You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina."" [fans his fingers out] Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady. "
9,7,Erection Day,48602,Butters,"That's right, Jimmy. "

10,12,Go God Go,54039,Butters,"Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later? "

10,13,Go God Go XII,54251,Butters,Eric? Is that you? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54253,Butters,"[looks around unsure what to make of this strange call] Eric, are you playing a joke on me again? "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54255,Butters,But... [notices Cartman entering through the front door] but you're here right now. [Cartman walks into view] 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54258,Butters,Huh?? 
10,13,Go God Go XII,54260,Butters,"But, you're telling me not to go with you. "
10,13,Go God Go XII,54270,Butters,"Oh, all right then. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54724,Butters,A midget? 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54839,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! [Butters runs off. Stan and Tolkien look at each other silently then shrug, as they turn to follow Butters] "

11,2,Cartman Sucks,54939,Butters,"[singing] Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... [continues howling the tune] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54941,Butters,"[stops playing and gets up] Whoa, hey Eric. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54943,Butters,[a little excited] A surprise? What is it? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54945,Butters,[really excited] Oh boy! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54947,Butters,Y-yeah! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54949,Butters,"[closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and gets on his knees] Oh, okay! [Cartman grabs a handkerchief from his back pocket and makes a blindfold from it, then puts it on Butters] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54951,Butters,"How come uh, I can't see? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54953,Butters,"Oh uh, ho yeah. "

11,2,Cartman Sucks,54965,Butters,[looks around] Hey. Where'd Eric go? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54967,Butters,Like what? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54969,Butters,What's... bi-curious? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54972,Butters,"Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. [smiles] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54976,Butters,"...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54979,Butters,Really? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54983,Butters,Whoa boy! Camp! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55011,Butters,Because I'm bi-curious? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55015,Butters,I'm bi-curious. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55037,Butters,He's bi-curious too? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55061,Butters,"Well sure, I guess. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55064,Butters,"Well yeah, sure. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55069,Butters,Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55071,Butters,"Yes, it's all very confusing! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55091,Butters,...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55093,Butters,"Awww, that's okay, Bradley. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55095,Butters,"Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55097,Butters,Wuh-what's the matter? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55099,Butters,"Well I like you too, Bradley. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55101,Butters,Well yeah! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55103,Butters,"Sure, I like like you a lot lot. [laughs] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55105,Butters,"[gives chase, but isn't fast enough] No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy! "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55125,Butters,"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55127,Butters,"Oh no, my Dad? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55129,Butters,"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55152,Butters,"[approaches the bridge] Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55155,Butters,"You're perfectly normal, Bradley. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55157,Butters,[gets angry] All right. All right that does it! [turns around and faces the crowd] I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was! [Bradley listens] You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!

I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along. "

11,14,The List,58214,Butters,"I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. [turns around and looks at them. The other boys look as well. Nearby, the girls chat among themselves, notice the boys, then laugh. Bebe holds up a notebook] "
11,14,The List,58226,Butters,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me. "
11,14,The List,58236,Butters,"[disappointed] Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls. "
11,14,The List,58240,Butters,[happily taking notes] Neat-o! 
11,14,The List,58242,Butters,[cheerfully] Okay!

12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58516,Butters,"[Walks over to Cartman, putting an arm around his shoulder] How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. [Smiles and kisses Cartman on the cheek, much to his horror] "

12,7,Super Fun Time,60193,Butters,Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60197,Butters,"No! [remembering how Cartman swung him around at Super Phun Thyme, he swings Cartman around and knocks Vosky down. He and Cartman sprint across the field and manage to avoid the barrage of bullets Wilskey sends their way] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60199,Butters,AAAAH! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60236,Butters,"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! [all energy leaves him and he passes out too] "

12,8,The China Probrem,60274,Butters,"Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60276,Butters,Why are they gonna kill my parents? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60278,Butters,I don't want my parents to die. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60280,Butters,Well sure. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60282,Butters,"Yeah, [pounds his left fist into the water] fuck 'em. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60306,Butters,Well I thought it was pretty good. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60311,Butters,"I'm scared, but I know my country needs me. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60313,Butters,"But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60315,Butters,Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60318,Butters,"[leans over] Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese. "

12,8,The China Probrem,60329,Butters,"Stay calm, Eric. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60331,Butters,"[bows a bit] Herro, prease. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60333,Butters,Fing fong ting tong. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60363,Butters,"Okay, okay. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60365,Butters,"Huh, invasion pran. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60373,Butters,We're busted! Uh what do we do?? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60376,Butters,A gun? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60378,Butters,"I don't want a gun, Eric! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60380,Butters,Oh jeez... 
12,8,The China Probrem,60386,Butters,No! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60388,Butters,"Waah! [looks away with his eyes shut and shoots at the patron. The bullet hits the patron in the groin, which splatters all over his clothes. The patron puts his hands over his crotch in pain] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60391,Butters,Huh? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60393,Butters,"But I was just trying to stop him, and you said- "
12,8,The China Probrem,60426,Butters,Uhwhat? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60433,Butters,What? What happened? [looks outside the window] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60435,Butters,"Aw, I did it again? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60437,Butters,"[finally speaks up] Well okay, I'm sorry! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60468,Butters,They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60470,Butters,"Uh, not exactly. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60472,Butters,"Well it's not where I aimed, honest. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60474,Butters,I seriously didn't mean it. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60476,Butters,"What? Uh where are you going, Eric? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60478,Butters,"By, by my, by myself? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60510,Butters,So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60512,Butters,[just stands there for a while] ...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. [walks off in a different direction] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60522,Butters,I don't wanna get killed by boobs. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60549,Butters,"Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey, everybody! [goes forth to spread the news. He walks by Stan, Kyle, and Bebe] Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60560,Butters,"Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60566,Butters,"Yeah, heh. [grabs his milk carton] If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. [takes a sip of milk through a straw and sets the carton down. Cartman begins to panic, looks around, and looks again at Wendy. Her face becomes the only thing he sees] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60590,Butters,"[walks into view] Ah, I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! [performs some punching moves] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60635,Butters,Almost time. [smiles] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60641,Butters,[cocks his head to his right] Huh. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60645,Butters,"[a door opens and his voice is heard] Eric. Hey Eric. [the camera shows Butters motioning Cartman over. Craig and Jimmy are behind him. Cartman looks over at them, then leaves his seat and walks to the door] Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60647,Butters,"But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh, to get out of the fight. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60651,Butters,"That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"". "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60656,Butters,That way it won't matter if you get detention. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60683,Butters,Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60692,Butters,"Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60696,Butters,She chickened out! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60730,Butters,[runs up to Cartman smiling] She's coming! She's coming! 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60732,Butters,But Wendy's coming to fight you. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60735,Butters,"All right! [other kids chatter around them. The Goth kids find some good spots along the brick wall. Red Goth and Kindergoth sit atop the wall, Tall Goth and Henrietta remain on the ground next to it] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60746,Butters,"Fuck him up, Wendy! "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60758,Butters,"Well, yeah. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61134,Butters,"Hello, heh. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61314,Butters,We lost? 
12,12,About Last Night...,61317,Butters,"Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61565,Butters,"Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61592,Butters,"Why that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61655,Butters,"Awww jeez, you're no fun. [turns right and walks away. At the other end of the hall, Bridon rounds a corner and dances down the hallway in Stan's direction] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61798,Butters,"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. [the girls congratulate her and Wendy says something in reply] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61800,Butters,"No surprise there. It's Bridon. [the boys and a few girls congratulate Bridon, who stays quiet] I get to be a stand-in! [moments later Wendy catches up to Bridon. Stan looks on from a distance] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61872,Butters,"[runs into the lab and hides behind the wall] Oh my God, oh my God! [runs up to Stan] Stan! Stan, we have a big problem. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61874,Butters,There's vampires in the school! 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61876,Butters,Vampires. I've seen 'em. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61879,Butters,"Ugh. [goes over to Kenny] Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61881,Butters,"[goes over to Kyle] But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61883,Butters,Really? Do you think that's best? 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61885,Butters,"All right! [runs to the entrance, then turns around] If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. [turns back and runs out] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61894,Butters,[pulls out a tiny tape recorder and starts dictating into it] 12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61896,Butters,[into his recorder] Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61899,Butters,That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61903,Butters,"Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're- [clock] uhn... [he's run out of tape. It rewinds to the very beginning and plays back] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61906,Butters,[jumps away and whips out a golden cross] Get back! You stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you! [runs away without his tape recorder] Hwaaaahh! 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61933,Butters,"Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61935,Butters,"Oh no, what'd I do this time? "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61937,Butters,[hangs his head and goes in] Oh jeez... 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61940,Butters,"I have no idea, sir. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61942,Butters,"Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-It's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were- "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61944,Butters,A well-organized pantry. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61946,Butters,"Well, okay, but, Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting- "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61948,Butters,"[hangs his head] Yes, sir. [Stephen walks away. Butters turns to the task at hand and begins putting stuff away] Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. [stops and thinks] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61952,Butters,"[walks towards them with hands outstretched] Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing? [pulls out the crucifix he used on them a few days before and sets it down on the snow, then continues towards them, hands outstretched] I- I'm Butters. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61954,Butters,"O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61956,Butters,"Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61958,Butters,"Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61960,Butters,"Yes! Yes, anything else? "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61962,Butters,"Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61977,Butters,"I have done what you've asked. [sets down the goods] A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61979,Butters,"Yeah, I guess. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61981,Butters,"Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61983,Butters,Whoa. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61985,Butters,"Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. [the Vamps leave Hot Topic] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61991,Butters,"I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61994,Butters,You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. [smiles knowingly. His parents are perplexed] 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61997,Butters,"I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. [his parents are stunned and just look at each other.] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62021,Butters,"Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee. [he jumps down from the window and hops onto Cartman's bed, ready to pounce on his throat. He wiggles his fingers, then relaxes them and grips Cartman's head and back] Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. [rears back and bites into Cartman's neck, making sucking sounds. Cartman wakes up and looks at him] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62023,Butters,"I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62025,Butters,"I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... [he vomits on Cartman's floor] "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62028,Butters,"[advances and hisses at Liane, then runs out through the window and crashes to the ground outside.] U-huh. [bumps into something] Ow. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62061,Butters,What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62063,Butters,Hey Dad. [he's crouching on top of his bookcase and startles Stephen] 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62065,Butters,I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62067,Butters,"Dahhh. [hops down from the bookcase and tries to hop onto his toy box, but he trips and lands on the floor. He gets up, climbs onto the toy box and crouches on the window sill, and hisses at them] I know now what I have to do! [hops down to the ground outside] Myah! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62082,Butters,Maybe not. [hisses. He's on all fours on the ledge behind the booths] Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires? [crawls closer to the Goths] I want to help you. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62084,Butters,"Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62086,Butters,I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. [the Goths look at each other] 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62089,Butters,Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62100,Butters,They're putting an end to it! [the clerk runs out of the store] 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62103,Butters,"[enters the living room happily] Mom, Dad! [closes the front door, runs to the sofa, and stands on the sofa between them.] I changed back! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62105,Butters,"Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again! "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62108,Butters,"What's that, Dad? "
12,14,The Ungroundable,62110,Butters,Uh oh. 
12,14,The Ungroundable,62112,Butters,"Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.] "
13,1,The Ring,62126,Butters,"[runs up to the boys' table] Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem! "
13,1,The Ring,62128,Butters,"[panting softly] Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend! "
13,1,The Ring,62130,Butters,"Um, does Kenny like her? "
13,1,The Ring,62132,Butters,"Oh, no. Oh, geez! "
13,1,The Ring,62134,Butters,"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's. "
13,1,The Ring,62136,Butters,"It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. ""Tammy Warner is a total slut!"" "
13,1,The Ring,62140,Butters,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.? "
13,1,The Ring,62269,Butters,[runs up to the boys] Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner. 
13,1,The Ring,62271,Butters,"Uh, what's that? "
13,1,The Ring,62273,Butters,[gets pensive] Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? [Stan and Kyle look at each other] 
13,3,Margaritaville,62689,Butters,"[waves to the camera, but his face is blocked by the 9 News logo] Hi, Grandma! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62742,Butters,"Well, [Kyle looks back at him] why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle? "
13,3,Margaritaville,62744,Butters,Well Eric did. [Kyle glares at Cartman again] 
13,3,Margaritaville,62828,Butters,Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62877,Butters,The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62892,Butters,This is gonna be great! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62894,Butters,Oh boy! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62899,Butters,"Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62921,Butters,"They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show? "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62945,Butters,They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip! [crosses his arms] They replaced it with the Queef Sisters! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62961,Butters,[writing left-handed] Robbed us of our innocence... [the girls return] 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62964,Butters,"Oh God, oh my God no! [runs down the hall and out the front doors of the school, still screaming and trying to get the queef off, then runs all the way home. He runs in, leaving the front door open and his father puzzled. He runs upstairs and into his room, slamming the door shut.] "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63057,Butters,Ohhhhh ohhhhh. [Cartman enters leading the other boys in class. He's carrying a box] 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63059,Butters,Oh. Hey fellas. 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63061,Butters,Aw thanks. 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63063,Butters,Ohhhhh ohhhhh! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63065,Butters,"My, my picture? "
13,5,Fishsticks,63170,Butters,"Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63175,Butters,Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63181,Butters,"[runs up to Cartman and Clyde] HA you said you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! [Cartman laughs. Butters soon joins him. Clyde just smiles sheepishly, knowing that's a good joke. Tolkien walks into view and Cartman runs to him. Clyde grins] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63188,Butters,"Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley! [runs towards the unseen voice] Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? [A hot new joke is born.] "
13,5,Fishsticks,63322,Butters,"[looks through the window] Hey look, Eric killed a dragon. "
13,5,Fishsticks,63388,Butters,"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! [outside, everyone scatters as robots march down the street firing off semiautomatic weapons. Cartman runs out to see what's happening. Butters and Jimmy follow right behind. Officer Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels look on helplessly] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63661,Butters,We can? 
13,7,Fatbeard,63666,Butters,[in thrall] Whoa. 
13,7,Fatbeard,63685,Butters,"Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates. [only four kids showed up - Kevin, Ike, Clyde, and Gordon Stoltski] Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! [blows into a whistle. To his left, by the stairs, is a door with a sign, ""Captain"" on it. Cartman enters the room though that door.] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63691,Butters,Yeah! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63695,Butters,Neato! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63697,Butters,Pirates ho! [holds up his own small sword. The others follow suit with daggers] 
13,7,Fatbeard,63706,Butters,[has second thoughts and turns around] Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this. 
13,7,Fatbeard,63708,Butters,"It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63711,Butters,"Huh, who, you mean you? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63713,Butters,"No, I'm sick of it! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63715,Butters,"He's right, lads. To adventure! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63718,Butters,Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons? 
13,7,Fatbeard,63720,Butters,"Uhh, [mumbles a bit] mahjey burazi? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63723,Butters,Oh. He-he says they're in there. [points to his left. A mustard-colored building is being defended by two guards.] 
13,7,Fatbeard,63765,Butters,ARRRRRRGH! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63794,Butters,Okay! [runs off to plunder] 
13,7,Fatbeard,63800,Butters,Have a good day! [the lifeboat is safely on the water. Cartman quickly begins to make changes. The French flag comes down and the skull and bones one goes up. Cartman walks up to the the ship's bow] 
13,7,Fatbeard,63803,Butters,"[at the wheel. Ike stands on a stool next to him] What's ""port""?! "
13,7,Fatbeard,63866,Butters,"One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63868,Butters,"Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63870,Butters,"Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63872,Butters,And our parents hollered at us! 
13,7,Fatbeard,63874,Butters,So we wanted to come here and be pirates. 
13,7,Fatbeard,63877,Butters,Huh? 
13,7,Fatbeard,63880,Butters,"Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63882,Butters,"Yeah, me too. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63889,Butters,"[runs up to Eric with Ike in tow] Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63891,Butters,"Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. [Clyde begins to cry again] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64166,Butters,"I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me. [Cartman hits the ball and it wraps around the pole, finally hitting Butters on his right temple] Ow. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64168,Butters,"Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! [Craig grabs the ball] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64170,Butters,"Uyeah, I guess I deserve it. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64173,Butters,Uugh! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64175,Butters,So what?! [the ball returns and Craig catches it] So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64178,Butters,Sellin' kisses? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64180,Butters,You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64183,Butters,"Oh boy, I sure am nervous. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64186,Butters,"Uh, how come? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64189,Butters,I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64191,Butters,"Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64194,Butters,"I'm going! [walks towards the back of the temp building] Ohh... [finds Sally and talks to her nervously] Oh, hi. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64196,Butters,"So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64198,Butters,"Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. [puckers up and steps closer to Sally] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64200,Butters,"Oh, money... Rrright. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill, then hands it to her] There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. [smiles, but that turns into surprise when she whips out her wad of bills and adds the five dollar bill to it. She puts the wad back away] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64202,Butters,"Thank you! [turns right and walks back to the playground. As he approaches the boys, he raises his arms up and smiles] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64208,Butters,"[thinking to himself] Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now. [frowns, thinking of what being a man entails] Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money. [aloud, smiling] Hey, I know. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64210,Butters,"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars! "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64212,Butters,"Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes! "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64216,Butters,"[taking his cut] Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64218,Butters,"Aww nuts! [walks off a bit] Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64220,Butters,"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64222,Butters,We could have our very own... [puts out his hands and frames an imaginary plaque] kissin' company. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64224,Butters,"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64226,Butters,"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64228,Butters,"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets [puts up a smiling sun sticker on Sally's row on the work schedule] a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64254,Butters,Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon? We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64256,Butters,Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. [pulls out his stack of bills and shows it off] 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64258,Butters,"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64260,Butters,...A pimp. Huh... 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64262,Butters,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. [smiles] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64264,Butters,"Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64266,Butters,"[addressing the pimp] Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64268,Butters,"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64271,Butters,What's the game? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64273,Butters,[taking notes] Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64275,Butters,I know what you're saying. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64277,Butters,[getting pleased] Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64280,Butters,Hey Dad! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64282,Butters,"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch. [walks past his parents and up the stairs, but stops for a moment and looks at them.] Do you know what I am saying? [they're left speechless as he continues up the stairs] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64320,Butters,"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64322,Butters,"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch [places his left hand on Sally's right shoulder], and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school! [walks away] Do you know what I am saying? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64325,Butters,"[sees an opportunity...] Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64327,Butters,Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64329,Butters,"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64331,Butters,"Oh, alright then. [copies some problems down, then looks at Wendy. Softly...] Hey Wendy. Wendy! [loudly] Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64333,Butters,"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64335,Butters,What? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64337,Butters,Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all. [turns to Wendy] Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64340,Butters,"[whips out a bill] Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64343,Butters,"Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64345,Butters,"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money! "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64347,Butters,"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie? [she gives him a freebie] Ohwoah, [twirls around] whoopie! [walks away, leaving Annie at her new post. As he re-enters the playground, Kyle meets him] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64349,Butters,"Sure, Kyle. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64351,Butters,"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there. [Kyle turns to see Stan, who's listening to Wendy over at the merry-go-round] He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64353,Butters,"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up! [storms off, but turns once more to ask] Do you know what I am saying?! [turns and continues walking towards the main building] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64374,Butters,And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. [looks up at her over his left shoulder] 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64376,Butters,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another... [looks for the right cell to place the sticker on and finds it] sunshine sticker for you. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64378,Butters,[gets excited] Mmmwhoa boy! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64380,Butters,"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64382,Butters,It's a kissing company. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64384,Butters,"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late. [puts his hand over the right side of his mouth and whispers so Charise doesn't hear] You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64386,Butters,"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64388,Butters,Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64390,Butters,In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64392,Butters,Huh? Why? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64394,Butters,But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64398,Butters,"Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. [Mr. Daniels' jaw drops, and Mrs. Davis looks at him] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64400,Butters,"Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64407,Butters,"[rushes in to keep the hos from fighting] Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches! "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64409,Butters,"Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64412,Butters,What's that? 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64418,Butters,"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64421,Butters,Wha? Awww. 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64427,Butters,"[moved to tears] Oh, oh. [feeling remorse] Oh jeez. [closes the front door softly] "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64429,Butters,"Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee. [the girls come and genuflect] Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64451,Butters,Yes! Yehhehehes! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64461,Butters,"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64467,Butters,Let's do this! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64478,Butters,Triceratops! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64492,Butters,"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! [throws his headgear on the floor and walks away glaring back at the coach] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64498,Butters,Okey doke. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64501,Butters,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64507,Butters,"Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64514,Butters,Now hold on! I am stopping the fight! [Stan headbutts him] Eoh! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64521,Butters,"That's because your mother betrayed my mother, Juggernaut! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64583,Butters,Yeah! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64608,Butters,No way! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64615,Butters,I'm freaking out... 
13,10,W.T.F.,64626,Butters,Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64690,Butters,"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64705,Butters,Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64707,Butters,[after Jimmy says something] Are you sure? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64714,Butters,He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64813,Butters,Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64815,Butters,"Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64817,Butters,"I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers. "
13,12,The F Word,65063,Butters,What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato! 
13,12,The F Word,65065,Butters,"I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider! "
13,12,The F Word,65067,Butters,It does? 
13,12,The F Word,65069,Butters,Okay. [walks out] 
13,12,The F Word,65209,Butters,"[voice only] That's because you guys never understood! [walks through the crowd of bikers and past the lead biker] You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom. "
13,12,The F Word,65211,Butters,"I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65277,Butters,Oh jeez! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65303,Butters,Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65305,Butters,That you hate Smurfs? 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65307,Butters,Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65310,Butters,[gasps and points] It is true! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65315,Butters,What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65325,Butters,Hey Eric! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65327,Butters,"Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65329,Butters,"Cool, thanks. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65331,Butters,"[a bit disappointed] Oh, okay. [hands him a five-dollar bill] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65340,Butters,"[showing up with his Melvins] Yeah, and she hates Smurfs! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65365,Butters,Whoa... [this time Kyle is the one who has his head in his arms] 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65381,Butters,That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65383,Butters,"We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65387,Butters,"I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it! [the Melvins cheer] So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! [the Melvins cheer again, and follow him out the side gate and on to Wendy's house] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65389,Butters,Let us not forget what happens this day! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65391,Butters,"We are here, Wendy Testaburger! [walks up to her front door, drops his pants and briefs, and pees on the front door.] "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65394,Butters,I am. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65396,Butters,The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65398,Butters,"Wah! [turns and waddles down the steps without pulling his pants up, then across the front yard] Smurfkiller! [runs down the street with the other Melvins] Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65416,Butters,"Ohhh, he's got her now! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65422,Butters,She's speechless! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65438,Butters,All right! Cartman's president. We did it. 
13,14,Pee,65462,Butters,What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide. 
13,14,Pee,65481,Butters,"[stops] Hey fellers, fellas hang on! I've gotta go to the bathroom. [Kenny continues across the pool without the other boys] "
13,14,Pee,65483,Butters,"Okay, thanks. [goes to the bathroom right there, no stepping out of the pool or nothin'] "
13,14,Pee,65487,Butters,"You said ""go ahead"". "
13,14,Pee,65491,Butters,"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do. "
13,14,Pee,65507,Butters,You bet! 
13,14,Pee,65530,Butters,The who? 
13,14,Pee,65533,Butters,"Whoopie! [Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny take their leave] "
13,14,Pee,65555,Butters,"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again! "
13,14,Pee,65593,Butters,"Come on, Kyle! "
13,14,Pee,65606,Butters,"Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! [the sign drops further into the yellow urine] "
13,14,Pee,65609,Butters,Do you need to wash your hands? 
13,14,Pee,65649,Butters,"You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle. "
13,14,Pee,65654,Butters,"Well yeah, seeing all that running water always makes me need to pee. "
13,14,Pee,65690,Butters,"Please, Kyle, I wanna go home. "
13,14,Pee,65719,Butters,"You can do it, Kyle! "
13,14,Pee,65722,Butters,[points to them] Hey look! [the helicopters are shown. Randy looks out from one of them] 
13,14,Pee,65729,Butters,"Hawww, you lived? "
13,14,Pee,65737,Butters,What's this? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65794,Butters,"Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65796,Butters,[pointing] I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they?? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65798,Butters,[to Clyde] Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that?? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65800,Butters,"Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button! "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65807,Butters,Oh no! 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65812,Butters,It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65818,Butters,Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume. 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65835,Butters,"There! It was like that! It looked just like that! [stands on his chair and points to a bush, then walks over to it] Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right.. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65837,Butters,[fights Kyle off] But this is what I keep seeing in my head! 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65839,Butters,"[fights Kyle off again] No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65841,Butters,Haah! Leave me alone! [reaches for the bush again] 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65873,Butters,"Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65875,Butters,"I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65923,Butters,"Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65973,Butters,"Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again! [swats the reporter's hand away and walks towards the camera] I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66011,Butters,"Kill John Lennon... [leaves his chair and walks across the kitchen] Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon... [reaches into a bottom drawer and pulls out a large steak knife] Kill John Lennon! [walks by his dad's study and stops to look in] Hey dad, where does John Lennon live? "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66013,Butters,[lowers the knife instantly] Aww. Dangit. [drops it and walks away] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66058,Butters,Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66060,Butters,Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66062,Butters,I am? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66064,Butters,Oh no. Which book was that? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66066,Butters,I don't even remember that. [gasps] But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66073,Butters,"Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66075,Butters,Huh? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66078,Butters,"[brightens up] Oh, thanks. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66085,Butters,I wrote that. [the adults begin to murmur amongst themselves] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66097,Butters,Thank you! [clasps his hands together and congratulates himself as he walks down the hallway] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66099,Butters,"That's nice. [waves to everyone and walks on, but runs into Stan and the boys, who are mad at him] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66101,Butters,"Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric? "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66103,Butters,"But, you told me I did! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66107,Butters,"Yeah, I'm broooding. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66113,Butters,"No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66126,Butters,I have to come right to my room after school. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66129,Butters,"Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66131,Butters,"Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66134,Butters,"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh. [gets into a trance] Kill Ronald Reagan. [hops off his bed and heads for the door] Kill Ronald Reagan. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66136,Butters,"Oh really? [goes back to his bed] Oh yeah, gosh dangit. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66162,Butters,"Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66164,Butters,"Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66166,Butters,"Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. [walks out of view] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66227,Butters,I know. 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66229,Butters,[lifts his head up. He's been crying. The Boys' smiles disappear] You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And now she's gone and it's because of me! [The Boys quickly showed sympathy for what they did] 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66232,Butters,"Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get through this. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66234,Butters,What? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66236,Butters,What?! Oh no! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66238,Butters,"Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. [leaves his desk and follows the other boys downstairs] "
14,5,200,66797,Butters,"Hey, Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise? "
14,5,200,66801,Butters,"How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise? "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67375,Butters,"[cries, taking a tissue from the box next to him] Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore! "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67424,Butters,"[in studio, sobbing] The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked. [a picture of the couple is shown, but her face is blurry. The picture was taken at a restaurant booth] And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth. [A picture of the three of them at the hospital. She shows off Washcloth, but her face is still blurry] Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67498,Butters,"[in studio] I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance. [at the Supply Max parking lot, walks up and kicks the door on Towelie's car] Towelie! Open the door! "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67500,Butters,"Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important! "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67537,Butters,"Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67544,Butters,"[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67547,Butters,"You're not the towel you used to be. [sniffles] Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today? "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67592,Butters,[emotional] Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you! 
14,7,Crippled Summer,67614,Butters,"He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. [resumes crying] "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67617,Butters,You will? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67673,Butters,Hey Eric. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67675,Butters,Ahhh well oh-[pumps his right fist] kay. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67677,Butters,"Eeyeah, I'm psyched. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67679,Butters,[starts pacing back and forth with energy] I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67681,Butters,NASCA- NASCAR? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67683,Butters,You're givin' away all your money?? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67685,Butters,You sure you want to do this? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67696,Butters,"[appears, hauling a cart] Hello! 'Scuse me! [the crowd quiets down and looks] I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all [shows off his haul] fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome! [turns around and skips away grinning] Heh! I helped the needy! [Kenny watches him leave] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67699,Butters,Hey Eric. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67701,Butters,Yep. You don't have a penny left. [points] You're poor as shit. [looks him over] How come you're hangin' upside down? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67705,Butters,Feel stupid yet? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67712,Butters,All those ladies have stinky vaginas? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67718,Butters,"Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67720,Butters,Wuh- uh I'm buyin'? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67722,Butters,"But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67724,Butters,"No, you're good. [behind them a woman and her daughter walk by and stop to look. Cartman chugs down another bottle of feminine wash] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67728,Butters,Really? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67730,Butters,That was fast. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67734,Butters,"Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir? [Dale looks over to his left. Butters is in the pit stop] Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67736,Butters,"Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67739,Butters,"[now on the walkie-talkie] Eric, are you sure you can do this? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67743,Butters,I think you gotta press the gas pedal. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67745,Butters,There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67750,Butters,[on the walkie-talkie and mortified] Eric? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67753,Butters,"Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67755,Butters,Eric! Don't ever talk like that! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67758,Butters,"How bad is it, doctor? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67760,Butters,Well at least there's that. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67767,Butters,"Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67769,Butters,"It has to be, Eric. [Cartman moves his right leg out of the sling and gets out of bed.] Eric, where are you going? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67813,Butters,"You seemed really stupid, Eric. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67819,Butters,Obama's fuckin' gay. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67821,Butters,Pissin' me off! 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67835,Butters,"Yeah, he's a champion alright. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67856,Butters,"Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side. [Danica Patrick finally comes out of her car] You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side. "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67860,Butters,That's fuckin' gay as hell. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67862,Butters,There you go. You're back on the track. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67867,Butters,"Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? [the #14 car is getting its wheels changed when Cartman barrels into it, causing it to flip over and land on its pit crew, killing them] "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67883,Butters,I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay. 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67895,Butters,[flabbergasted] Huh? 
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67897,Butters,"Uh, but- but you- you said I had to [begins to stammer, both walk off, as Kenny stares in confusion] s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- [unintelligible] "

14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68093,Butters,Kyle did that? Gee whiz. 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68095,Butters,Are you being serious? 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68097,Butters,"Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68148,Butters,Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh! 
14,10,Insheeption,68178,Butters,"Hey, Stan, I have a note for you. "
14,10,Insheeption,68180,Butters,"Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this. [hands him the note] I'm like a mailman. [walks away. Stan reads and Kyle notices] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69531,Butters,You didn't read them? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69537,Butters,"Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it? "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69611,Butters,"""You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."" "

15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69749,Butters,The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff. 
15,2,Funnybot,69837,Butters,[runs up breathless] Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us? 
15,2,Funnybot,69904,Butters,Not again. 
15,2,Funnybot,69924,Butters,"Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it. "
15,2,Funnybot,69927,Butters,Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Tolkien says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70163,Butters,"And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70165,Butters,[jumps up on the bench] Skeletor is real?? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70167,Butters,Skeletor's a lady?? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70169,Butters,Hey Eric. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70185,Butters,Is that really all our wiener sizes? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70188,Butters,"Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70194,Butters,A conspiracy? 
15,4,T.M.I.,70202,Butters,"Whoa, it's a little chilly in here. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70204,Butters,"Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70206,Butters,"Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70208,Butters,I'm hung like a horse! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70369,Butters,"Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! [throws down his pencil and notepad in disgust] "
15,4,T.M.I.,70371,Butters,"I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! [kicks his bed] "
15,4,T.M.I.,70373,Butters,"[begins to vent, pacing back and forth] Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me!

15,6,City Sushi,70647,Butters,Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. [hands him a flyer] 
15,6,City Sushi,70649,Butters,An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials. 
15,6,City Sushi,70651,Butters,"You can count on Postman Butters! [salutes and leaves. As he does so, the cashier makes a ball out of the flyer and tosses it away. Butters doesn't notice, but instead sees a woman coming up and hands her a flyer] Special delivery, ma'am. [sees a man coming up and hands him a flyer. The woman crumples up her flyer and tosses it away] Here you are, sir. [the man balls up and tosses his flyer away] Brand new sushi restaurant in town. [Butters sees another man and hands him a flyer] A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! [the man crumples up his flyer and tosses is away. Butters ends up in front of City Wok and enters. He approaches the counter] "
15,6,City Sushi,70653,Butters,"Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you. "
15,6,City Sushi,70655,Butters,It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town. 
15,6,City Sushi,70657,Butters,"Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers. "

15,6,City Sushi,70710,Butters,Oh hey Dad. 
15,6,City Sushi,70712,Butters,"I love you too, Dad. "
15,6,City Sushi,70733,Butters,Sure. 
15,6,City Sushi,70735,Butters,"Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver. "
15,6,City Sushi,70737,Butters,Sure. 
15,6,City Sushi,70739,Butters,"Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun. "
15,6,City Sushi,70741,Butters,"Uh, well, to solve mysteries. "
15,6,City Sushi,70743,Butters,"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil! "
15,6,City Sushi,70745,Butters,What? Why would I do that? 
15,6,City Sushi,70747,Butters,"Me, Butters. "
15,6,City Sushi,70749,Butters,"Sir, I'm confused. "
15,6,City Sushi,70751,Butters,Really? 
15,6,City Sushi,70754,Butters,Pardon me? 
15,6,City Sushi,70765,Butters,Yes! 
15,6,City Sushi,70767,Butters,"[a recording] This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping. "
15,6,City Sushi,70768,Butters,"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal. "
15,6,City Sushi,70769,Butters,"[a recording] Well goodnight for now. [leaves the desk and goes to bed] Goodnight, Butters. "
15,6,City Sushi,70770,Butters,"Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward. [fast-forwards three hours and then gasps. At normal speed, his bedroom door opens slowly. A second later, Dr. Janus enters] Dr. Janus? [nothing happens for three more hours, so Butters fast-forwards to 3:32 in the morning, when Dr. Janus unzips his pants, pulls out his dick and urinates all over Butters, puts his penis away, zips his pants up, and punches Butters HARD several times before running out of the bedroom. Six seconds later, Butters is fully awake] "
15,6,City Sushi,70771,Butters,[a recording] Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again! 
15,6,City Sushi,70772,Butters,"Oh, sweet jumping Jesus! "
15,6,City Sushi,70786,Butters,"[nervous] Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem? "
15,6,City Sushi,70788,Butters,"Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face. "
15,6,City Sushi,70790,Butters,Huh? 
15,6,City Sushi,70792,Butters,"Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a- "
15,6,City Sushi,70796,Butters,This is illegal. We could get arrested. [Dr. Janus breaks into some display cases and swipes the jewels into a satchel that Butters is carrying] Oh Jesus! 
15,6,City Sushi,70798,Butters,"I'm trying, sir! [this changes Dr. Janus' behavior] "
15,6,City Sushi,70800,Butters,What? 
15,6,City Sushi,70802,Butters,"But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh... "
15,6,City Sushi,70819,Butters,"That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more- [a bicycle horn stops him, and he holds on to his Professor Chaos mask. He looks over and sees Dr. Janus on a child's tricycle glaring at him] Waaahh! [runs away. As he does, he tosses the Professor Chaos mask back into the cardboard box. Butters runs into the neighborhood park. Dr. Janus chases him down and tackles him there.] "
15,6,City Sushi,70821,Butters,"[sees a couple walking by] Um, excuse me? "
15,6,City Sushi,70823,Butters,Wahh! 
15,6,City Sushi,70825,Butters,"Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you. "
15,6,City Sushi,70827,Butters,What?? 
15,6,City Sushi,70829,Butters,No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters! 
15,6,City Sushi,70837,Butters,"It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this. "
15,6,City Sushi,70839,Butters,"Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here! "
15,6,City Sushi,70841,Butters,Hah? 
15,6,City Sushi,70843,Butters,Aw man. 
15,6,City Sushi,70845,Butters,"Oh, come on! "
15,6,City Sushi,70847,Butters,AAAAAAAAAAA! [runs away. Dr. Janus follows him upstairs] AAAAAAAAAAA! 
15,6,City Sushi,70849,Butters,"Waaaa! [runs to the end of a hall and knocks on the door found there. The door opens and he falls into a room. He looks up and gasps at what he sees: walls covered in newspaper headlines about City Sushi and its chef, and one word written in blood: KILL. Dr. Janus reaches the room and Butters looks over his shoulder. Dr. Janus squints his face and combs over his hair: it's...] "
15,6,City Sushi,70868,Butters,Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.

15,8,Ass Burgers,71175,Butters,Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?

15,8,Ass Burgers,71183,Butters,Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71262,Butters,"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71287,Butters,"[approaches Kyle] Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. [Kyle leaves to see who it is] "

15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71412,Butters,"[saddened] Oh, what, I'm not a good Meheecan? "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71443,Butters,"[thinking to himself] Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71445,Butters,"[wanders around] Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border! [walks further away, and finds a road. He walks along the shoulder and shivers as he sings]  Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work.  [A couple in a car drive up behind him] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71450,Butters,"Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. M-mis amigos, my a-, my amigos are waiting. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71452,Butters,"I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71476,Butters," Work, Mexican, Work. [hums some more] Work, Mexican, Work   "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71481,Butters,Wow! A present just for me? [starts to unwrap it]

15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71510,Butters,"Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone? "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71513,Butters,"So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! [the workers all stop in shock and look at him, a utensil can be heard hitting the floor] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71518,Butters,"Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco! "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71522,Butters,Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border? 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71524,Butters,"All my amigos are there, waitin' for me. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71528,Butters,Viva la Meheeco! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71535,Butters,We're crossin' the border! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71537,Butters,Olé! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71562,Butters,"Oh uh, I'm sorry, [opens his arms wide] I don't really- "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71564,Butters,Wow. 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71579,Butters,"Thanks everyone. [hops onto the table] It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos. [gets sad] It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71581,Butters,[aside to the Mexican sitting at the table with him] ...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish. 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71591,Butters,[looking back at him] Game on! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71593,Butters,[dodging the bullets] AAAH! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71596,Butters,AAAAH! [falls and gets up] I'll get over! [runs farther away from the tower] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71598,Butters,"[sees a gray burro and jumps up on him] Giddy up! [gallops away. Cartman gets on a pale gray burro and whistles, and gallops after Butters] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71612,Butters,[taunting] Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71614,Butters,Base! [dances around with his arms outstretched] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71618,Butters,"So then, so then the fireman says ""That won't even fit in my scrotum!"" [the boys laugh again] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71621,Butters,"Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71636,Butters,Eavesdropper? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71648,Butters,[moves off] Hey! Pete Melman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71680,Butters,It's megasuperhilarious! [a girl is putting her books away when Cartman approaches her] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71787,Butters,NO Wikileaks! Bad! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71812,Butters,Biggest story about who? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71850,Butters,There he is! [the kids go to the cage] It's Lemmiwinks! [climbs the chair beside Lemminwink's cage] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71867,Butters,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71890,Butters,Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! [Indeed. Lemmiwinks had bit Wikileaks on the jugular and Wikileaks is bleeding. Wikileaks soon stops moving and Lemmiwinks gets off him] 
15,12,1%,72257,Butters,"Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon. "
15,12,1%,72259,Butters,"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? [the doors burst open and Cartman steps in and looks around. No one says a word] "
15,12,1%,72261,Butters,"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club. "
15,12,1%,72268,Butters,"Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair. "
15,12,1%,72274,Butters,"Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is. "
15,12,1%,72311,Butters,I sure hope this works. 
15,12,1%,72411,Butters,"Hey, what are you fifth graders doing? "
15,12,1%,72414,Butters,"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72462,Butters,"Oh neato, huh fellas? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72466,Butters,[innocently] Thanksgiving is about murder? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72523,Butters,Okay Dad. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72773,Butters,"Yep. To find out who the poorest kid is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72775,Butters,So then I cross-referenced all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72777,Butters,"Well actually, Eric, it's you. [Cartman keeps his smile for a few seconds more, then frowns.] "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72779,Butters,"Now that Kenny's gone, [points to Cartman] your household actually has the lowest income. [Cartman is stunned, then dejected. Butters consoles him] I'm sorry, pal. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72781,Butters,"Uh, I won't tell anybody. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72986,Butters,"[laughs] Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out? [looks around] But I thought you sit on the toilet this way. [demonstrates by sitting backwards on his chair] So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No? [turns around] Oh jeez, that's embarrassing. "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72996,Butters,My grandma is from Virginia. [smiles] 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73213,Butters,A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you! 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73314,Butters,[loses control of the sign] Whoops! [it lands face up on the snow] 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73316,Butters,"[winces, then massages his right arm] Sorry. My arms hurt. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73366,Butters,"[looks around at his fellow sign twirlers] We aren't makin' that much, fellas. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73395,Butters,"Oh sorry, sorry. [looks back at his seat and pulls out the sign. then points it at Cartman. Cartman then hops out and proceeds to the plant, with Butters following] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73400,Butters,Sorry! [catches up to him] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73440,Butters,"[going through a hallway with a trolley] Equipment is flying in, ten seconds. "

16,3,Faith Hilling,73491,Butters,AAAA!!! 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73496,Butters,AAAA!!! 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73507,Butters,What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw? 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73509,Butters,"Well, count me out. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73511,Butters,"Well, I'm scared. [Craig shows up] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73547,Butters,"Oh, that's okay. I think... "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73551,Butters,HA?! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73737,Butters,[at the middle of the line] Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73745,Butters,"You mean it's like, like a monster? "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73751,Butters,"AAAAAAHHH! [scared as hell, flees] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73759,Butters,"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up. [a loud peal of thunder] It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73761,Butters,AAAAAHHH! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73763,Butters,"No, it's a school night! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73767,Butters,You think Jewpacabra is here? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73769,Butters,Oh good. Maybe we scared it off? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73771,Butters,"Oh God, I'm scared. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73773,Butters,"Eric, stop it! "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73775,Butters,I'm not saying Jesus is a lie! 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73777,Butters,Jesus is a lie? 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73779,Butters,Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality. 
16,4,Jewpacabra,73781,Butters,"Oh, hamburgers. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73844,Butters,"It's all quiet out front, Eric. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73846,Butters,"He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. [a boom breaks out. The three boys take to their heels, screaming] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73848,Butters,"[though the radio] Hey, Eric. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73850,Butters,"Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. [he is definitely at Wingstreet, and Craig and Tolkien are buying some meal] "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73852,Butters,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide. "
16,4,Jewpacabra,73933,Butters,"[angrily] Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you... You heathen! [the crowd agrees, then resumes their hunting] "
16,5,Butterballs,73942,Butters,"[walks in with a black right eye] Heh, h-hey fellas. [takes the remaining spot. Stan, Kenny, and Craig look at each other.] "
16,5,Butterballs,73944,Butters,"OH. [looks around nervously] Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways. "
16,5,Butterballs,73946,Butters,...Yeah. [looks down at the table] 
16,5,Butterballs,73948,Butters,"Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale. "
16,5,Butterballs,73950,Butters,"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy. "
16,5,Butterballs,73952,Butters,"Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin. "
16,5,Butterballs,73962,Butters,My Grandma? 
16,5,Butterballs,73967,Butters,"Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second? "
16,5,Butterballs,73969,Butters,Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone? 
16,5,Butterballs,73972,Butters,"I just... [holds his hands up in self-defense] don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma. "
16,5,Butterballs,73974,Butters,"Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma. "
16,5,Butterballs,73976,Butters,"No, you took it all! "
16,5,Butterballs,73999,Butters,[quickly slams his locker door shut] My grandma?? 
16,5,Butterballs,74001,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! [runs off to the closest restroom, runs in and closes the door] "
16,5,Butterballs,74003,Butters,[startled at first] HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma. 
16,5,Butterballs,74005,Butters,"Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me. "
16,5,Butterballs,74007,Butters,"Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! [he holds her off] "
16,5,Butterballs,74011,Butters,[looks at the floor] Yes... 
16,5,Butterballs,74039,Butters, Trapped inside the darkness of my mind. I try to break free. The words are so unkind.   
16,5,Butterballs,74044,Butters,"Can I, can I not do this, please? [the video stops and the hallway lights come on] I don't wanna do this. "
16,5,Butterballs,74046,Butters,"Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me. "
16,5,Butterballs,74065,Butters,"Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. [Grammy jabs him again, and he winces in pain] "
16,5,Butterballs,74067,Butters,"Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. [the doorbell rings] "
16,5,Butterballs,74075,Butters,HAAAAA! [pounds the table fiercely to relieve the pain from Grammy's fork] 
16,5,Butterballs,74089,Butters,"[having a conversation with himself] We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself! [switch] Oh, but violence is never the answer. [switch] But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is! [switch] You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice! [goes into his closet and pulls out a box] Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself! [unpacks his Professor Chaos costume and puts it on] It's time you met... Chaos! [he bursts into the hallway] I've been pushed around for the last time! [runs to the guest bedroom, where Grammy is staying] Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! [bursts into Grammy's room, but is suddenly surprised at what he sees - Grammy in a supervillain outfit] "
16,5,Butterballs,74132,Butters,"Oh uh, nothin'. "
16,5,Butterballs,74134,Butters,Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show. 
16,5,Butterballs,74136,Butters,"[feeling cornered] Please, leave me alone. "
16,5,Butterballs,74138,Butters,No it doesn't. 
16,5,Butterballs,74140,Butters,Stop it! 
16,5,Butterballs,74152,Butters,"Grandma? I did it, Grandma. [she opens her eyes] I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the snot outta Dr. Oz. [she frowns] I can't lie, it felt kind of good. [she smiles] At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time. [her smile fades] Poor old Grandma. You know, I-I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die. [the anger leaves Grammy's face] Someday pretty soon. [he approaches Grammy] And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you. [walks back to the door] 'Night Grandma. [exits and closes the door] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74441,Butters,"[runs across the hallway] Fellas! Fellas! Fellas! [spots them in another hallway and runs to them] AAAAH, fellas! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74443,Butters,"[stops and catches his breath, then jabs his right index finger at the floor] Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?! "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74445,Butters,[jabs his finger again] Guess! 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74447,Butters,There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad. 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74453,Butters,"Look, look, there she is. [near the bleachers opposite the doors are five girls: Red, Wendy, Bebe, Lola, and Jenny. Between Wendy and Bebe are two pompoms waiting for a sixth cheerleader, who arrives shortly. It's a black girl. The other five girls begin talking to her all at once] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74520,Butters,How come? 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74522,Butters,"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74525,Butters,"Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. [hands her the towels] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74641,Butters,"[holding Cartman's right hand] It's gonna be okay, Eric. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74643,Butters,They'll find love somewhere else. 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74645,Butters,"Yes, they will. "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74649,Butters,"In... In who, Eric? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74741,Butters,"Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74743,Butters,"That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74767,Butters,"I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Err, what should I do with it? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74769,Butters,"Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh, [passing Clyde and Kevin] you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74786,Butters,"Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing! [silence] We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74788,Butters,"This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met! [walks up to Tolkien] Well Tolkien, you're nicer than anybody I know. [walks up to Clyde] And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74790,Butters,"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us? [stands on a bench] Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74792,Butters,"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74794,Butters,"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the gooey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74825,Butters,Huh? 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74828,Butters,"Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74830,Butters,"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74832,Butters,'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. [sticks out his tongue a bit] 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74839,Butters,"[stops his car and looks at the girls] I love you too, ladies. [blows them a kiss] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74843,Butters,Woohoohoohoohoo! 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74845,Butters,"Wuh wuuuhhh wuh! [sits up] Wha? Wha? Oh. [smiles, Then looks under the covers] Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again. [the door opens and Stephen steps in] More of my creamy goo came out. [Stephen sits on the bed] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74847,Butters,"[excitedly] I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74849,Butters," Okay Dad! [Stephen gets up and walks out, and Butters opens up the top drawer of his night stand. He pulls out a small bottle, gets comfortable again, and collects up all the cream] Oh! Save that, for later. [puts a cap on the bottle] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74874,Butters,"Wuh sure, Eric. [Cartman walks in and Butters closes the door] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74876,Butters,"Uh-uh oh, no E-Eric, you're, why you're a great player. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74878,Butters,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74880,Butters,"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out. [remembers looking at his groin and saying ""Oh jeez, there's a lot this time.""] But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74883,Butters,"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. [before them is a wall of semen samples that Butters has been collecting for over a year now. Another shot shows that he's going on two years' worth of semen, with shelves of it on the other two walls] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74885,Butters,"I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. [Cartman takes a bottle and chugs it down, then analyzes the flavor] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74887,Butters,Do you feel warm and compassionate? 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74905,Butters,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Tolkien! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. [Cartman approaches North Park's #7 and knocks him down. A referee sees this, blows his whistle and walks over to the two players] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74908,Butters,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up! [the team cuddles up and Butters continues.] Now what is goin' on out there? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74911,Butters,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. [Butters passes bottles of his semen around to the other boys, and they all drink the bottles down] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74927,Butters,Like me! 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74934,Butters,"42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT! [Cartman tosses the balloon back at him, and the players move forward. Butters backs up for a pass and throws the balloon up. The other team's player, #9, is ready] Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it! [#9 catches it and grins] Good job, kid! [an SUV rools onto the field, crushing #9 before it stops. The balloon bounces away unscathed. Randy is shown driving the SUV, with Sharon in tow] "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74948,Butters,"[walks up and stands next to Stan] Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74957,Butters,What's sarcasm and what's cum? 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74961,Butters,"[wakes up and gasps] DAD! Hey, Dad! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74963,Butters,My wiener is all stiff and pointy! 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74965,Butters,"Thanks, Dad. "
16,11,Going Native,75450,Butters,Leave me alone! 
16,11,Going Native,75452,Butters,"Get out of here, all of ya! [Stan turns to the other boys and shrugs] "
16,11,Going Native,75454,Butters,"[runs out of the restroom up to Kyle and points at him] You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because [walks to Stan and points him out] your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image! [runs back inside the boys room, then turns around and runs to Cartman] You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up [moves over to Jimmy], and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny! [moves over to Kenny] The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! [runs back into the restroom and locks himself in. The other boys are stunned and silent] "
16,11,Going Native,75456,Butters,[runs out of the restroom again and storms up to Cartman] AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! [Cartman looks stunned]Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! [runs back into the boys restroom and locks himself in] 
16,11,Going Native,75458,Butters,[opens the door and peeks out] Double wow! [slams the door and locks it] 
16,11,Going Native,75462,Butters,"[In a gruff voice] I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess! "
16,11,Going Native,75464,Butters,"I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn! "
16,11,Going Native,75466,Butters,"Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! [both parents look taken aback as a moment of silence follows] "
16,11,Going Native,75471,Butters,It's not?! 
16,11,Going Native,75473,Butters,Yeah? 
16,11,Going Native,75475,Butters,"[normal voice] Hey yeah, all the time. "
16,11,Going Native,75484,Butters,Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?! 
16,11,Going Native,75486,Butters,Uhbu-but I'm from here. 
16,11,Going Native,75488,Butters,We're from Hawaii? 
16,11,Going Native,75490,Butters,But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period? 
16,11,Going Native,75505,Butters,"They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right! [Kenny takes one suitcase and Butters' right hand, Butters takes the other suitcase, and Kenny attempts to lead Butters out. Suddenly Butters stops and yanks his hand away] No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! [Kenny sighs, then takes Butters to the teller] "
16,11,Going Native,75508,Butters,"I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua! "
16,11,Going Native,75512,Butters,Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?! 
16,11,Going Native,75515,Butters,"[slowly, as he looks around] Well, we're here. Now what do I do? [Kenny points to the information officer nearby, and they walk to him] "
16,11,Going Native,75517,Butters,"Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go? "
16,11,Going Native,75519,Butters,"Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. [the officer just looks at him. A group of Americans approaches him] "
16,11,Going Native,75521,Butters,Yeah? 
16,11,Going Native,75523,Butters,"Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny. "
16,11,Going Native,75525,Butters,"Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come. "
16,11,Going Native,75528,Butters,You folks are all native Hawaiians too? 
16,11,Going Native,75533,Butters,"What's ""saimin""? "
16,11,Going Native,75547,Butters,"[turns right and coughs, then] Whoa, it's like gasoline! "
16,11,Going Native,75549,Butters,"[finishes the rest of the drink, then stumbles just a little bit and smiles] Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better. "
16,11,Going Native,75566,Butters,I've never done this before. [gets into position] 
16,11,Going Native,75568,Butters,"Aim... my anger! Stupid [swings successfully] Ben Affleck! [the golf ball sails through the air and enters the bridge, smashing through the window and the captain's binoculars. The first mate shrieks] Waaah! [the captain stumbles onto a controller and breaks it with sheer momentum. The ship begins to pitch back and sink. Passengers begin to tumble towards the water. Butters is dumbfounded. The ship breaks in two] "
16,11,Going Native,75585,Butters,"[jumps in front of Kenny to shield him] No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks! "
16,11,Going Native,75589,Butters,"He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?! "
16,11,Going Native,75597,Butters,"Kenny, be careful! "
16,11,Going Native,75604,Butters,Kenny! 
16,11,Going Native,75617,Butters,"Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything! "
16,11,Going Native,75620,Butters,"Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh! "
16,11,Going Native,75635,Butters,[he has six golf balls in front of him and he hits each one towards the Coast Guard] Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All! 
16,11,Going Native,75640,Butters,"[runs onto the plaza] Surrender?! No, the heck with that! "
16,11,Going Native,75642,Butters,"Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes! "
16,11,Going Native,75644,Butters,"No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director! [turns around and walks away] All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH! "
16,11,Going Native,75655,Butters,"[he thinks for a moment] Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez. "
16,11,Going Native,75658,Butters,"What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. [smiles with relief] "
16,11,Going Native,75660,Butters,"Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology. [he and Kenny walk off into the sunset] Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75718,Butters,Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75722,Butters,"I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75725,Butters,Come on! What are you guys goin' as? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75887,Butters,"That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf. [a giant stops by] Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75889,Butters,"Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. [Gangnamstein turns left and runs into a man] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75925,Butters,Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. [Kyle knows what this means and walks over to his iPad] 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75972,Butters,"Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?"" "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75974,Butters,"And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."" "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75978,Butters,"Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76008,Butters,"[turns around and lift up his right arm] Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! [Stan is surprised to see Butters with a brown bracelet. Butters turns around and walks to his locker] "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76011,Butters,Well yeah. [points to it with his left hand] It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. [switches folders] 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76017,Butters,I donno. I got mine down at 7-11. [takes Stan down to the store] See? Right here. [a small rotating stand stocked with Stanground Bracelets is shown] 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76041,Butters,He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76047,Butters,Who? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76053,Butters,"Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76056,Butters,Go Stan! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76058,Butters,"...A little unnecessary, but go Stan! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76061,Butters,Prostitute! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76145,Butters,"[approaches Stan] Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76147,Butters,Yeeah. Is it true? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76149,Butters,"Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole, [pokes Stan in the belly] but n-now I think you're a cute sneaky little butthole. [smiles, turns and walks away] "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76175,Butters,Wu-what sound? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76294,Butters,"Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76296,Butters,"Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76298,Butters,"He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think. [glances over his shoulder and gasps] Uh, don't make me say any more! "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76300,Butters,"I can't! Don't you see?! [feels around his body for something, and finally finds it: a small bottle. He opens it up and pulls out a blue M&M.] Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76302,Butters,"[his voice trembles] It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Please, just leave me alone. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76304,Butters,Well... hah... HWAAAH! [quickly swallows the pill and makes sure he doesn't throw up] 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76309,Butters,Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. [passes out] 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76328,Butters,[hard to understand with his face puffed up] What's up fellas? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76330,Butters,"Bleh, ogayedmi. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76332,Butters,AGH! No! Please! You can't! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76334,Butters,Okay! Okay! He's helping the Chinese get something they want. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76336,Butters,Because the Chinese actually want to protect something that's important. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76338,Butters,At Red Robster. [Kyle looks at Kenny] 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76341,Butters,[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76344,Butters,[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76348,Butters,[stressing] Red Lobster! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76392,Butters,I didn't say anything. I promise. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76394,Butters,"Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76505,Butters,Ww-ww-what's the N-S-A? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76507,Butters,The government watches everything we do? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76509,Butters,"Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Tolkien, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government. [smiles, then walks to his bed and goes under the covers, then gasps] Oh yeah. [gets out of bed and goes to his mark] Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble... [a little softly] I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year. [normal] 'Night, Government. [goes back to bed] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76541,Butters,"Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. [ding] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76543,Butters,"Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, ""If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness."" Are these people nice? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76545,Butters,"Oh Jeez. [The monitor displays ""TICKET #403 WINDOWS 15"" and a small bell dings. Butters gets off his seat...] Oh God, huh... Here we go. [...and walks up to a clerk, but has no idea what to do] I yelled at a midget. [a few seconds pass by] I was, I was watching MTV and-and this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"" [no reaction] And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76547,Butters,"Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! [begins to walk away and launches into the song]  Livin' in America! Eye to eye! Hand to hand! Across the nation! Smokestack, fatback, Many miles of railroad track Ow! I said Ow ow! [exits]   "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76564,Butters,"Sure, I love the Truth. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76566,Butters,Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76568,Butters,Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76570,Butters,"Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76576,Butters,Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76578,Butters,"Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature? [goes and gets some booklets he picked up at the DMV. He hand them the booklets and they leaf through them] This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! [smiles and closes the door, then walks towards the kitchen] "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76608,Butters,"Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76610,Butters,We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76614,Butters,"You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76616,Butters,"Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama. [hands him a booklet] Could you read this part out lout? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76618,Butters,Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76620,Butters,"Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76622,Butters,"Uh huh. [looks at Craig] Did you follow all that, Craig? [his eyes dart around] Uh, I don't think I really followed all that. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76643,Butters,"Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76647,Butters,[takes a few steps away from the group] I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance. [the group turns to face the flag] I pledge allegiance. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76683,Butters,Hello. How would you like to know the Truth? 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76685,Butters,"It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76687,Butters,[steps in and approaches Cartman] It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. [gives him a DMV booklet] 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76689,Butters,"Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes. "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76691,Butters,Yes. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76693,Butters,Yes! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76695,Butters,That's right. 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76698,Butters,"We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?! "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76700,Butters,Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?! 
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76702,Butters,Hallelujah! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76721,Butters,Murder porn? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76749,Butters,"I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76835,Butters,"[through his tears] I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76837,Butters,Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well! [Mr. Mackey happens along] I was trapped down there all night! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76841,Butters,I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76869,Butters,Huh? 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77122,Butters,Yes. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77148,Butters,Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse! 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77150,Butters,Holy Moly. 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77220,Butters,"Well, at least I'll bet Tolkien's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Tolkien? [Tolkien just stands up, looks at the other guys, and walks out. Butters' smile fades] "
17,5,Taming Strange,77544,Butters,"Heheh, yeah. [chuckles to himself. Kyle is now annoyed and embarrassed] "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77809,Butters,"Whoa, look at it! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77817,Butters,"Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77820,Butters,Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! [leaves. Only Kyle remains with Cartman] 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77829,Butters,"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77831,Butters,Busted! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77991,Butters,"Just stop, please. "
17,7,Black Friday,78073,Butters,"Woo, spooky. "
17,7,Black Friday,78089,Butters,"[runs up with a sheet of paper and hands it to Cartman] Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! [salutes with his left hand] "
17,7,Black Friday,78091,Butters,"[lowers his hand] Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet. "
17,7,Black Friday,78106,Butters,"Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones. "
17,7,Black Friday,78108,Butters,"Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay? "
17,7,Black Friday,78110,Butters,"Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers? "
17,7,Black Friday,78112,Butters,"Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all. "
17,7,Black Friday,78173,Butters,"Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. [closes his case by crossing his arms] "
17,7,Black Friday,78175,Butters,I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78299,Butters,"[not sure what to do next, then swats Scott on his back] Yeah! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78345,Butters,"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78347,Butters,They don't! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78349,Butters,"Yeah, I finished it! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78351,Butters,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78353,Butters,Wha-what do you want me to do? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78355,Butters,Who's George R. R. Martin? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78375,Butters,"Well come on, Scott. You're lagging. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78377,Butters,"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. [Butters and Scott stand in front of a mansion gate somewhere in the Southwest. Cacti abound on either side of the high fence. Butters reaches up and presses a buzzer] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78379,Butters,Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78381,Butters,"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up? [two seconds of silence] Hello? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78383,Butters,We're not fans! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78385,Butters,"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78387,Butters,"Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! [the buzzer sounds again and the gates open. Butters and Scott go inside and towards the front door. George R. R. Martin steps outside to greet them] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78389,Butters,"Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78391,Butters,When? 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78393,Butters,[sternly] Please. It's urgent. 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78395,Butters,"No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78397,Butters,"Uh what's the matter, Scott? "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78399,Butters,He's diabetic. 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78401,Butters,"Oh. Okay, thanks. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78464,Butters,"OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78466,Butters,But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! [Scott had said he needs to eat every two hours] 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78502,Butters,"[gets off the sofa] Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78504,Butters,What kind do we want?! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78507,Butters,"Come on, Scott! We're leaving! [helps Scott off the sofa, and they're about to leave] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78509,Butters,"NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78511,Butters,Whatoyou mean? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78644,Butters,Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78646,Butters,"What's that? [looks around, than below, his horse] Awww! [horse is shown with a huge semi-hard penis.] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78747,Butters,"Hey, fellas. What did I miss? [smiles] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78775,Butters,The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78788,Butters,"[pops up onscreen] Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78815,Butters,"So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""- "
17,10,The Hobbit,78817,Butters,"[confused for a moment, then looks over his left shoulder] Oh. Yes? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78819,Butters,"Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78821,Butters,"See ya, Lisa! [Esther overhears the conversation from the next table and looks over her shoulder at Butters] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78826,Butters," Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da.  [Wendy comes to view at the end of the hall and spots him, then walks up to him] Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day. Oh-   "
17,10,The Hobbit,78828,Butters,"Oh. Hey, Wendy. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78830,Butters,Am I just an asshole? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78832,Butters,"Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78834,Butters,"Ah, I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78836,Butters,Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78838,Butters,"I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women. [opens his locker again. On the door are several pinup posters of Kim Kardashian] I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect everything. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78840,Butters,You're a liar! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78847,Butters,"You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78851,Butters,"Oh, she said it again! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78862,Butters,"Oh no, you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up! "
17,10,The Hobbit,78864,Butters,"Well, alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! [she goes back inside, and Butters follows her in] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78866,Butters,Okay. 
17,10,The Hobbit,78868,Butters,That's Lisa Berger? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78870,Butters,She's pretty! 
17,10,The Hobbit,78872,Butters,Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78874,Butters,"And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this [sends it off] and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. [runs out of the lab] "
17,10,The Hobbit,78877,Butters,"Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger? [walks over to Cartman] Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78879,Butters,"II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78881,Butters,What?! Well since when? 
17,10,The Hobbit,78955,Butters,No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! [Craig flips back to her] 
17,10,The Hobbit,78958,Butters,"I do love water balloons. [the boys fall silent and continue viewing the pictures. Stan gets sad and leaves; viewing all those pictures, not one of them of Wendy, disheartened him] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79033,Butters,[pops up out of his seat and looks behind it] Rotten boobie turds! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79055,Butters,Man this sucks! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79061,Butters,"Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79087,Butters,[at the computer] We already got a dollar! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79089,Butters,One dollar pledge! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79092,Butters,Another two dollars! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79112,Butters,"[next to the phone, answers it. Stan is on his iPhone] Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79136,Butters,[gasps] Oh no! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79147,Butters,"Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79200,Butters,Happy Deadline Day! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79202,Butters,"Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79204,Butters,It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79206,Butters,Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79208,Butters,Somebody killed Kickstarter! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79225,Butters,"Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times! "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79262,Butters,We finally did it! 
18,3,The Cissy,79597,Butters,"[at the urinal, pants down] Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more. "
18,3,The Cissy,79599,Butters,[looks over] I think someone's in there. 
18,3,The Cissy,79712,Butters,That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom. 
18,3,The Cissy,79714,Butters,"He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. [turns around and walks away.] "
18,3,The Cissy,79739,Butters,Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom] 
18,3,The Cissy,79777,Butters,"[walks past Stan, then stops] Hey! Everything okay, Stan? "
18,3,The Cissy,79779,Butters,"Just hold it. That's what I do now. [continues on his way. Stan walks towards the girls room, but veers left to look at the boys room. Then he spins round and walks to the Other room, whips out his key for it, and goes in.] "
18,3,The Cissy,79802,Butters,"Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?! "
18,3,The Cissy,79804,Butters,Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy! 
18,3,The Cissy,79818,Butters,Hey! Where do you think you're going?! 
18,3,The Cissy,79820,Butters,"Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom! [points to the Cissies bathroom, which used to be the Other bathroom] Well go on, cissy! [Stan walks over to the cissies bathroom and goes in. Butters smiles and walks away. The cissies bathroom is just the Other bathroom with a new plaque on it. Stan claps twice and the lights go down. Vivaldi's ""Spring"" plays] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80080,Butters,"Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80082,Butters,"Hey, Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80084,Butters,"I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80086,Butters,My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80088,Butters,You can see the momma bird fly in. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80090,Butters,We took all kinds of video with his drone. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80092,Butters,"[looks over his shoulder] You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere, and shoot video, and stuff. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80096,Butters,It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80098,Butters,Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80100,Butters,My dad said it's not for spying on people. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80102,Butters,"Oh, he'll know. You can hear it take off. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80104,Butters,"[goes to take the drone back] No, Eric. I don't wanna d- "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80108,Butters,"Comin', Dad! [leaves the garage through the side door into the house] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80111,Butters,"Yes, it's me. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80113,Butters,Of course not! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80115,Butters,What?! You said nobody would know! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80117,Butters,Be careful! The powerlines! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80120,Butters,"Okay, uh, maybe that's enough. [the drone approaches Craig's window] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80123,Butters,[gruffly] Let me see! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80126,Butters,Jeeeeezz! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80130,Butters,What do I do?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80132,Butters,[begins to panic] I don't know what to do! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80148,Butters,"[already in his PJs and in bed, but clearly panting] Oh, heh-hey, Dad. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80150,Butters,"[panting throughout] Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80152,Butters,"I love you too, Dad. [Stephen leaves and closes the door. That was close.] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80184,Butters,What the heck are you doing?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80186,Butters,When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80188,Butters,You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80190,Butters,Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80192,Butters,WHY?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80194,Butters,I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80258,Butters,Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80260,Butters,"Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80262,Butters,Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80264,Butters,Why?! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80266,Butters,That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80309,Butters,Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80311,Butters,I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll- 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80313,Butters,"I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses! "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80315,Butters,I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80317,Butters,I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does! 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80319,Butters,You do? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80321,Butters,What? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80323,Butters,NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna- 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80325,Butters,...Okay. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80330,Butters,"If this doesn't work, we're dead. "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80340,Butters,Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80342,Butters,"No! No, no! I'm sorry. Thank you, Eric! I screwed up everything, but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass! "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80358,Butters,"Congratulations, Kyle. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80361,Butters,"Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. [Kyle taps on the button and coins pop out at him] "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80366,Butters,We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80613,Butters,"WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there! [Craig turns to watch] I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands, I can see them too. Whooaa... [He and Stan bump into each other and Butters begins to run his hands over him] Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80615,Butters,I feel Stan! He looks totally real! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80617,Butters,"More of the school. [Clyde talks to Bebe, who then leaves] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80619,Butters,The school and all the kids. [Clyde walks away] I still can't hear any sound except for your voice. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80621,Butters,"[beginning to wobble] Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- [about to take off the fake headset] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80623,Butters,What what what? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80625,Butters,"[turns so that he's facing away from the camera] Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80627,Butters,I'm sorry! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80629,Butters,Yeah. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80631,Butters,[begins to run] Oh Jesus! [Cartman looks on from around the corner] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80633,Butters,"Okay, I'm back in your room! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80635,Butters,"[drops a shield over the glasses] Suppornity window dropped. [Cartman enters his room, locks the door and turns on the lights, then walks over to Butters and removes the fake headset. Butters wipes his eyes] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80637,Butters,Wow! That was cool! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80639,Butters,I touched Wendy's boob. [smiles] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80648,Butters,Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period? [in a knowing voice] Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? [chuckles] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80650,Butters,"You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said ""Well, technically I was in school."" Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80652,Butters,Yeah. [runs off with his food tray] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80656,Butters,"Well, not a hundred percent... "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80658,Butters,"Okay, subject is ready. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80660,Butters,Interim status is go. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80662,Butters,It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80664,Butters,"Going now! [bumps into the door frame, then goes downstairs. A second or two later Cartman comes out of the closet, turns on the light, goes to his computer and sits on his chair] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80666,Butters,Okay. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80668,Butters,How much more of this am I supposed to clear up? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80670,Butters,"Okay. It's so realistic. [a shot of Stan watching from across the street.] The snow looks kind of fake though. [Stan leaves the window] Alright, I think that's all of it. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80672,Butters,[rings the doorbell. A middle-aged woman answers the door with a dollar bill in her hand] There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80674,Butters,"Okay, I got it! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80676,Butters,Already? Oh no! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80678,Butters,"I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. [goes inside, leaving the front door open] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80680,Butters,"Hello, Dad! It's me, Butters! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80682,Butters,This is for all the times I got grounded! [makes a fist and fires it at Stephen's groin. Stephen doubles over in pain] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80684,Butters,"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist! [at the other end of the call, Cartman is shocked] Haha! How do you like that, Dad?! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80686,Butters,"Huh, that was incredible! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80688,Butters,"I feel amazing! [giggles] I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?! [starts throwing rocks] Eh take that, you stupid cars! [a hit car screeches to a halt] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80691,Butters,[knocks the driver out of the car] Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80693,Butters,Whoa! I'm in the car now. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80695,Butters,"Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80697,Butters,I'm gonna beat her up and take her money! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80699,Butters,"Take that, you dumb hooker! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80701,Butters,I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80703,Butters,"I can't [wheeze] I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80707,Butters,I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80709,Butters,Aw nuts! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80711,Butters,I wonder how long I'm grounded for? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80713,Butters,Ahhh! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80715,Butters,Eric! Uh what are you doing here? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80717,Butters,What? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80719,Butters,[looks around skeptically] Nuh uh! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80721,Butters,WHAT?? [Cartman puts on a couple of thumb lights and clicks them on and off in alternate order.] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80723,Butters,"[now on edge] Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80725,Butters,Ah how do you know that?! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80728,Butters,Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80731,Butters,NO! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80733,Butters,"[thoroughly scared, shuts his eyes] AAAAAAHAHAH! [he opens them moments later and Cartman is gone.] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80754,Butters,Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80757,Butters,...What? What do you mean? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80759,Butters,I don't know what you mean. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80761,Butters,"Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80763,Butters,"Oh really? Oh, that's a relief. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80765,Butters,Oh gosh! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80767,Butters,OH GOSH! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80769,Butters,Yeah. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80773,Butters,"Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80775,Butters,"No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80777,Butters,"I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80779,Butters,PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the- 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80781,Butters,Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- [Kyle looks concerned and hangs up] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80890,Butters,"[singing a spiritual] I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. [his door opens and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come in] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80892,Butters,[startled] Huh. But... [stands up] you guys can't be here. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80894,Butters,Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80896,Butters,"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember? [goes to the bedroom door] We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80898,Butters,YES. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80901,Butters,[really startled] AAaaghagh! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80903,Butters,Huh I'm sorry Dad! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80923,Butters,"[wakes up] Ahhh, huh? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80925,Butters,"You... you, you mean ih... [sits up] I'm not grounded? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80927,Butters,They did it! [hops off his bed] They figured it out! [heads out the door] Whoopie! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80937,Butters,"[hops in like a bunny] Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80958,Butters,Oh no! Kenny! 
18,8,Cock Magic,80960,Butters,But he's dying! [Kenny lays down a card] 
18,8,Cock Magic,81118,Butters,"Dangit, I wish I knew people. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81122,Butters,[chuckling] Yeah. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81203,Butters,"Wow, the cops came? "
18,9,REHASH,81237,Butters,What's a PewDiePie do? 
18,9,REHASH,81340,Butters,Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich. 
18,9,REHASH,81463,Butters,It's true! 
18,9,REHASH,81465,Butters,Heheyehah. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81501,Butters,"Hmmm, it's kind of gay. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81503,Butters,"I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know? "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81505,Butters,"Well, gay is wholesome. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81817,Butters,"No, he got brainwashed by a cult. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81819,Butters,What?? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81830,Butters,"[runs up to the other three] Did you guys hear? Cartman got four days' detention, for calling Heidi Turner ""clitty litter""! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81832,Butters,"But the thing is, Eric isn't even fightin' it. It's like he's all sad and scared. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81900,Butters,"Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81902,Butters,Yeah! 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81912,Butters,Well ohhh-kay! [walks off after Cartman] 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81961,Butters,What do we do now? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81963,Butters,[earnestly] Oh no! 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82009,Butters,"I'm here, Eric. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82011,Butters,Yes Eric. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82028,Butters,"Well they're fine. Everyone's just kind of keepin' their mouths shut. It's kinda nice. [smiles] So the PC guys are leavin' people alone. Well, except for... "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82030,Butters,"Well, well now they've made Kyle their main target. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82032,Butters,"Eric, what are you doing? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82034,Butters,"Oh, but I thought you agreed with them. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82036,Butters,Well ohhh-kay! 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82105,Butters,Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese! [sits back down] 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82120,Butters,Uhn-un. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82127,Butters,"Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either. [Kyle is left alone, bewildered] "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82147,Butters,What made Mr. Garrison do that? 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82149,Butters,You really think Kyle would do that? 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82154,Butters,Lion King II? 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82160,Butters,"No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT! "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82191,Butters,She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it! 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82193,Butters,Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something! [stomps his right foot down on the snow] Jeez! 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82195,Butters,"Well I don't want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric! "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82197,Butters,No! The one in the white shoes isn't that ugly. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82199,Butters,"Okay! [walks over to the bench with the girl in white shoes next to it] Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82201,Butters,"Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he's still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82213,Butters,Here you go. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82215,Butters,"What's ""sore-y""? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82217,Butters,"Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that's neato. [his cell phone rings] Oh. Eh, hang on Charlotte, one sec. [walks off a bit and picks up] What do you want?! "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82219,Butters,"No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82221,Butters,"If I'm gonna be with this girl, I don't want her someday thinking it was all super-rushed! "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82224,Butters,"Yeah, just some work-related stuff. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82226,Butters,"[getting nervous] Oh boy, yes I'd love to, here we go, oh God. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82235,Butters,"Well uh, well yes, sir. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82240,Butters,"W-wait, you don't wanna be here? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82242,Butters,"Wuh well, you know, 'cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82244,Butters,"But- so- then, why did you leave? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82246,Butters,"Jeez, how bad can a president be? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82255,Butters,"You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82257,Butters,"I wasn't supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don't even wanna be here. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82259,Butters,"There's really nowhere I'd rather be. [smiles] If it's okay with you, well I'd like to try a nice Slow Cosby instead. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82261,Butters,So do we. 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82291,Butters,Charlotte! 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82293,Butters,"Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby. "
19,3,The City Part of Town,82310,Butters,Well do you think it's true? Do you think we're really bigoted country bumpkins? 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82523,Butters,Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh? 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82525,Butters,Whoooaaa. [opens the bag and begins eating what's inside.] 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82527,Butters,"How do you do it, Eric? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82529,Butters,"Jeeeeezzz. [a second later, Kyle walks by with David] "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82560,Butters,"Well aren't you eatin' lunch, Eric? "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82568,Butters,"Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82611,Butters,"[noticing] Oh, hey Eric. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82613,Butters,"Oh I'm sorry, bud. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82615,Butters,"Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, you really started something. "
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82617,Butters,"Well if these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of, set the record straight and show them the way it's supposed to be done. "
19,5,Safe Space,82818,Butters,Do I gotta? 
19,5,Safe Space,82820,Butters,"Well, if I get detention, uh, I'll get grounded. "
19,5,Safe Space,82842,Butters,"[sounding quite tired] Eric, hold up. "
19,5,Safe Space,82844,Butters,"Yeah. Yeah, right here. [hands him the papers] I just finished this morning. "
19,5,Safe Space,82846,Butters,Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here. [points to the first comment on the current page] 
19,5,Safe Space,82848,Butters,It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness. 
19,5,Safe Space,82858,Butters,"But, PC Principal, I really don't have time. "
19,5,Safe Space,82860,Butters,Yes sir... 
19,5,Safe Space,82870,Butters,Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus. 
19,5,Safe Space,82872,Butters,Whoa my God. Wugh. 
19,5,Safe Space,82875,Butters,[startled] Yeah! 
19,5,Safe Space,82877,Butters,"Well, I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people. "
19,5,Safe Space,82879,Butters,"Well, I've got Demi Lovato [points to her] to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments. "
19,5,Safe Space,82883,Butters,"Okay, Eric. [Cartman walks away] "
19,5,Safe Space,82889,Butters,"[Butters is seated across from PC Principal with an entire row of plus-sized women in lingerie] Do I have to, sir? "
19,5,Safe Space,82891,Butters,"PC Principal, ah, I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through. "
19,5,Safe Space,82893,Butters,Vin Diesel too?? 
19,5,Safe Space,82947,Butters,"[reading through online messages] ""Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-"" [begins to gag] oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible [picks up a waste basket and vomits into it] Augh. [coughs] Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. [continues reading comments aloud] ""I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-"" [villianous piano music begins to play] Oh God! [Reality sneaks into his room and paces behind Butter's chair] Uh, delete! ""You aren't fat, but my dick is-"" Whoa, God. "
19,5,Safe Space,82949,Butters,GAAAHHH! 
19,5,Safe Space,82951,Butters,"What? [falls out of his chair. Reality tries to grab him, but misses. Butters runs to a night stand] "
19,5,Safe Space,82953,Butters,"I don't know you, sir! "
19,5,Safe Space,82956,Butters,"[panicked] Well-ll, the man! Uh, the man is gonna get me! [Butters points to where Reality was standing only for the shot to widen showing he is no longer there] "
19,5,Safe Space,82973,Butters,The man! The man the man the man the man! [runs around the corner completely naked] The man he's gonna get me! He shadows me everywhere! [stops another student and gets in his face] Do you see the man?! 
19,5,Safe Space,82975,Butters,"Well, he's gonna get me! "
19,5,Safe Space,82977,Butters,[breaks free and runs off] The world is darkness! The man is coming! 
19,5,Safe Space,82979,Butters,Aaaaa! Aaaaa! 
19,5,Safe Space,82982,Butters,"[runs into the classroom] Run for your lives, you little fuckers, the man is coming! [the kids scream as Kyle enters the room. Stan, Davíd and Kenny follow him in] "
19,5,Safe Space,82984,Butters,The man is gonna get me if I don't stop! 
19,5,Safe Space,82986,Butters,[thinks a moment and jumps through a glass window on the second floor] YEEAAAAAGGHH! [hits the snow hard] 
19,5,Safe Space,83010,Butters,Are you sure this is a good idea? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83028,Butters,"Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83211,Butters,Yeah! 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83349,Butters,Over this way! [they all go have a look] 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83380,Butters,"Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me? "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83382,Butters,OOF. Ow. Ahem. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83392,Butters,"We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-. "
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83432,Butters,Yeah? 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83434,Butters,Uh I thought you said it first. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83448,Butters,"Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys! "
19,8,Sponsored Content,83541,Butters,[runs into view towards the other fourth graders] PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! [turns right and runs down another hallway] 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83833,Butters,[runs up with Cartman] Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83889,Butters,What about Jimmy's? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83892,Butters,What are you doing now? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83897,Butters,"Wow that looks fun! [Kyle closes the popup and tries again. A couple of windows later, he gets a news article] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83911,Butters,"Wow, what kind of ice cream is that? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83913,Butters,"So Clyde said to Tolkien, ""Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?"" [the boys laugh] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83915,Butters,Well Tolkien was all like- 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83920,Butters,"We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer! [The boys split for the computer without their ice cream, except to Cartman, who takes his... and a couple of seconds later, Kenny's] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83961,Butters,"We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84019,Butters,Yeah. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84022,Butters,Nothin'. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84029,Butters,"Wuh huh, that's a good point. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84087,Butters,"[still in his halo, talking to Charlotte on his iPhone] Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84089,Butters,"I will, honey. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84100,Butters,"Heh, [sing-song] Kyle's got a girlfriend? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84110,Butters,Guns? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84116,Butters,I already feel a lot safer. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84119,Butters,[giggles] Yeah. 
20,1,Member Berries,84516,Butters,"Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth! "
20,1,Member Berries,84518,Butters,[shows the other boys] Look! There's Wendy's mom with a dick in her mouth too! [Jimmy laughs and takes a closer look] 
20,1,Member Berries,84523,Butters,Eric! What happened! 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84659,Butters,"They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84661,Butters,What are we gonna do about them? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84665,Butters,"He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84676,Butters,"It's him, or us! "
20,3,The Damned,84854,Butters,"[under his bed covers] It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us. "
20,3,The Damned,84856,Butters,It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us. 
20,3,The Damned,84886,Butters,[lets out a] Eeeaaaahhhh! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85026,Butters,"It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85028,Butters,"[becomes shocked] But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85030,Butters,"Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you. [starts shouting] Those sneaky snakes in the grass! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85032,Butters,"Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85034,Butters,So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every [slams the keyboard] last one of you! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85036,Butters,Oh Charlotte? [presses on the mouse] Are you there? [presses on the mouse] Honey? 
20,4,Wieners Out,85065,Butters,"Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? [talks while walking] All I've been hearing in a few weeks is how [stops walking]this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85067,Butters,"[turns towards and points at him] This is a war [walks from Kyle] on all of us. You want to listen to Uncle Kyle, we'll go ahead. Pretty soon [stops walking, and faces Tweek and Craig] they'll be locking us all up. And don't think you're safe either, Tweek and Craig. Just 'cause you're gay does not mean that you aren't looked down upon for being boys! [turns to his left] The world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with [points downwards] wieners! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85069,Butters,"No! [walks towards Kyle] We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us? "
20,4,Wieners Out,85071,Butters,"[turns around] Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85073,Butters,"I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind, [points at Kyle] or are you with Uncle Kyle. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85098,Butters,"[takes off his pants and underwear, pulls his shirt, and raises his fist causing people to be shocked] "
20,4,Wieners Out,85131,Butters,[speaks through a microphone while rallying a group of boys with their pants pulled out] We walk together in peace! We walk together in pride! We're not gonna feeling ashamed for who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85133,Butters,"Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow less because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85135,Butters,"What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry! "
20,4,Wieners Out,85138,Butters,Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85140,Butters,You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85271,Butters,"Good for you, Uncle Kyle! "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85287,Butters,"[is seen with his pants put down and shirt pulled up] Anytime anywhere, skank. "
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85290,Butters,Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man? 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85335,Butters,[with his pants down and dick out] Well okay. [pulls his pants back up.] 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85408,Butters,The bouncy ball? 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85503,Butters,[runs up with his boxes and throws then down] That's it! I am through with your stupid crap! Every house I've been to just rips on me and and says Denmark is stupid! 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85507,Butters,I told you fellas! This is what you get for working with a bunch of stupid girls! 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85825,Butters,What do you want?! 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85827,Butters,"Well I don't know, Eric. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85829,Butters,NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor! 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85831,Butters,"Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?! "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85833,Butters,"Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now! "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85835,Butters,"Oh God, listen to you! [mimics his last sentence] ""Please don't call her that I really like her."" You've changed, Eric! You've really changed! Now get the fuck out of my house! [Cartman is taken back, but closes his mouth and walks out the door. Butters slams it closed behind him] "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85955,Butters,"Traitor! [Stan, Wendy, and Bill Clinton see him outside with four other boys - Craig, Clyde, Tweek, and Francis] Fuck you, Stan! You're a traitor! [drops his pants to show his wiener and puts his fist high up in the air] "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85958,Butters,How dare you be ashamed of who you are?! [steps forward and presses his wiener onto the window] 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85986,Butters,[over his shoulder] What? 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",86014,Butters,"Well, I'm just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I'm tired of girls saying boys need to change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights! "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",86016,Butters,[suddenly tears up] No. 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",86018,Butters,The end? Of what? 
20,8,Members Only,86130,Butters,"Hey, Eric! [seen right near Cartman] "
20,8,Members Only,86132,Butters,"Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number. "
20,8,Members Only,86134,Butters,"[shows complete fear] No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse. "
20,8,Members Only,86190,Butters,"Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too. "
20,8,Members Only,86192,Butters,"No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect. "
20,8,Members Only,86194,Butters,Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton? 
20,8,Members Only,86196,Butters,Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great. 
20,8,Members Only,86199,Butters,"Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time. "
20,8,Members Only,86206,Butters,[laughs] That's already funny! [Cartman gets frustrated and makes a fist with his left hand] 
20,8,Members Only,86241,Butters,"Hey, that's me too. Yippee! "
20,8,Members Only,86279,Butters,"Mr. Musk, wait! [Musk turns around] Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. [Cartman flashes an angry face at Butters] "
20,9,Not Funny,86360,Butters,"[sits on chair, watching the conversation] He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot. "
20,9,Not Funny,86421,Butters,[talks to woman employee walking by] Hello. [enters the bathroom] 
20,9,Not Funny,86423,Butters,[talks to Cartman] Going pee! 
20,9,Not Funny,86425,Butters,Because you keep on telling everyone she is. 
20,9,Not Funny,86427,Butters,"Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! [walks closer to the toilets] I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart. "
20,9,Not Funny,86429,Butters,"That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop. "
20,9,Not Funny,86431,Butters,"Sure buddy, sure. "
20,9,Not Funny,86468,Butters,"Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us. "
20,9,Not Funny,86470,Butters,"The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86635,Butters,Yep. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86637,Butters,Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86669,Butters,Because Eric knows the future. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86691,Butters,[Whispering] Look underground. 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86783,Butters,"I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86829,Butters,"Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86832,Butters,What?! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86834,Butters,"Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you? "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86836,Butters,"Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it. "
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86838,Butters,Like enough to get humanity to Mars. 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86972,Butters,"Okay, [laughs, then faces the speaker] Alexa, add ""smelly tampon boogers"" to my shopping list. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87088,Butters,What was? 
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,87094,Butters,How do you change someone who's mentally abusive? 
21,2,Put It Down,87245,Butters,I thought you said you broke up with Heidi. 
21,2,Put It Down,87249,Butters,So then why did you take her back? 
21,2,Put It Down,87436,Butters,"Hey Craig, how come Tweek's not at school? "
21,3,Holiday Special,87498,Butters,"[runs up between Stan, Kyle, and Cartman] They can't do this! We made plans! [runs off] "
21,3,Holiday Special,87500,Butters,[returns] You can't take away a day off! We're just innocent children! 
21,3,Holiday Special,87528,Butters,It ain't right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you're a piece of trash! 
21,3,Holiday Special,87538,Butters,I love that movie. 
21,3,Holiday Special,87541,Butters,Dang it! There's nothing? 
21,3,Holiday Special,87646,Butters,"It's over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87760,Butters,"No Dad, I'm not looking at boobies. [Stephen closes the door and Butters waits a few second before cackling again] Waahahahahaha! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87763,Butters,"Oh, hey fellas. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87765,Butters,"Uuuuuuummm, nope. [turns around and walks off, the others wait a second or two before catching up] "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87767,Butters,"[turns around] Yes, fellas? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87769,Butters,You mean like Suicide Squad? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87771,Butters,[in Stan's face] Suicide Squad sucked! [turns around and walks off again] 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87773,Butters,"Look fellas, you have a right to be on Facebook and I have a right to be on facebook. And sometimes that's going to cause a little... [makes a fist and smirks] CHAOS. [looks mischievous and gets slick] Gotta get to classss. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87789,Butters,[as Professor Chaos] Who are you?! What do you want?! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87791,Butters,"Oh. Are you Adam? Well, come on in. [Adam walks in with Butters and Butters closes the door. Butters gives him a tour of the place] You're making a smart career choice, Adam. You see, what we do here is utilize Facebook not only to spread chaos, but to actually profit from it. You'll find the hours very reasonable and I'm working on getting full health and dental for all employees. [stops and gets a uniform off the shelves for Adam] Here's your company uniform. You see, what I've done, Adam, is build a completely self-sustaining Chaos machine [Adam exits the boys room as Chaos #28] - You look fantastic - doing nothing more than what Facebook was designed to do. I make money from Facebook for my fake content in order to pay Facebook to promote my fake stories. And thusly we're growing bigger every day. Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the other workers look towards them] We have a new agent in Chaos. Please welcome Adam Borque. [the others clap for him] Here you go. You can take this workstation, Adam. Just start writing horrible things about people and presenting it as reality on Facebook. Alright! Don't forget we have a Chaos quota, gang! Let's really fuck shit up! [the workers resume their work] "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87881,Butters,Attention employees. Kelly Shmidt has just written her 100th fake blog post that was shared over a thousand times on Facebook. Let's hear it for Kelly! [the staffers clap] Don't forget about those Chaos incentives! You too can benefit from pandemonium. [smiles. Coon and Friends show up and walk through the front doors] 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87885,Butters,"Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87888,Butters,"It's the 21st century, gentlemen! There's nothing illegal about what I'm doing. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87890,Butters,"Actually, that IS illegal. And besides, you can't do anything to me. [whistles. Zuckerberg emerges from the back of the store on the second floor, flips over the balcony, and lands in front of Butters] "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87897,Butters,It's the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal protection from Mark Zuckerberg. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87951,Butters,"What's goin' on? Hey everyone, keep working! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87955,Butters,What are you talking about? [a door is heard shut] 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87957,Butters,"Curse you, Coon and Friends! This isn't over! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87960,Butters,Uh oh. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87963,Butters,"Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87966,Butters,"Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn't break any rules. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88052,Butters,"[walks in and goes to the urinal] Hey fellas! [smiles and looks at them, then turns around and drops his pants and briefs, then lifts up his shirt and pees in the urinal] Boy, that Marcus kid is on the warpath, huh? Well, he's really motivated. I mean, screw that kid, but I guess it's good somebody's finally doing something about these goddamn drug dealers. [Butters finishes, flushes the urinal, zips up, and turns towards the other boys and looks at them again, smiling] Well, see ya, fellas. [turns left and walks out. The other boys haven't moved an inch the whole time he was there] "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88107,Butters,Drug dealer?? 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88141,Butters,Haw Jeez. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88147,Butters,"[trying to see the game] Get out of the way, dude! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88180,Butters, Insane in the brain   
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88213,Butters,"Hey, where are ya'll goin'? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88333,Butters,"[walks by with his pumpkin and his mom] Hey, where you been, Eric? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88374,Butters,"Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! [next to him, Cartman has an angry glare on his face] "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88377,Butters,"Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. [the camera begins to focus on Cartman's glare] "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88379,Butters,"Yeah, but what are we gonna do? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88383,Butters,"Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88385,Butters,We've got to do something to get rid of her! 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88415,Butters,"I knew Eric would come up with a plan! [Cartman puts up a drawing of his plan, which involves the boys luring Heidi to her death, burying the body, and celebrating her death with a pizza. He then brings out his retractable pointer and starts pointing] "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88475,Butters,"Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88483,Butters,"Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88485,Butters,"How uh, how is runnin' the country going? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88487,Butters,Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88489,Butters,Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88491,Butters,"N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88493,Butters,"Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88495,Butters,"Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88536,Butters,Okay! Where? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88538,Butters,Holy moly! [leaves his chair and follows the others out] 
21,7,Doubling Down,88602,Butters,"Well, it's not our problem. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88636,Butters,"Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88680,Butters,"[walks up to him] Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You're right, it's our moral obligation. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88682,Butters,"Oh, we're not? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88684,Butters,Oh. Okay then. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88772,Butters,"Fuck him up, Eric! "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88948,Butters,Whoa. [turns around] Uh hey. 
21,8,Moss Piglets,88950,Butters,"Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89122,Butters,Fight's over. Kyle ruined it. [Kyle is left all alone in the hallway] 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89430,Butters,"Well, should we order now? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89571,Butters,[raises his hand] Add together the three and the three. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89666,Butters,"Waaah! [startled, he almost loses the rifle, but gets control of it and aims it at Cartman] Ah! Uh-oh! [walks over to him] Hey Eric. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89668,Butters,"Oh, Jeez, want me to help you study? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89670,Butters,"Oho, Black Panther? Well that was a great movie! [smiles] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89672,Butters,"Well, what do you want me to do? I got hall monitor duty. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89674,Butters,"Okay, Eric. [turns around and walks away] "
22,1,Dead Kids,89770,Butters,Wull it's the entire glee club this time! 
22,1,Dead Kids,89772,Butters,Oh crap! The math quiz? It's already fourth period? 
22,1,Dead Kids,89774,Butters,Well okay! [slow motion effect as they run through the school] Waaaahahaaaaaagh! 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89862,Butters,"Father, can I talk to you? "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89864,Butters,"Well, what's troubling you? [sits down next to Maxi] You know, at school the kids used to all make fun of me sometimes. One kid would say something mean, a-and then the other kids would laugh. I know how lousy it feels. I learned to just walk away, not give 'em all the satisfaction. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89866,Butters,"I know it seems impossible. I thought I'd be a punching bag my whole life, but now, I'm one of the popular kids. I even get invited to board game night at Stan's house. My point is, sometimes, y-you just gotta put yourself out there. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89872,Butters,"[walks in] Oh hey, fellas. I hope you don't mind I brought a friend. Come on in. [steps aside for his friend to appear - it's Fr. Maxi] "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89876,Butters,"So, Kyle, did you know Father is a really good singer? You like to sing too, don't you? "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89883,Butters,"Aw, Father, wait a- "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89886,Butters,Father! [follows Maxi out and closes the door] 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89891,Butters,"Come on, Father, you can't give up so fast. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89893,Butters,Who cares? Who cares what people say? 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89895,Butters,"Aw, come on, you gotta be strong! "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89897,Butters,"Because I was you. Okay? I wasn't always this cool. I've been through it. But then one day, somebody told me something. He said ""life is full of love and light and bountiful things,"" and you know who told me that? You did! Two years ago, in church! You have a right to go and be happy! And if people wanna keep tryin' to knock you down, well, fuck 'em! "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89911,Butters,There's no church today! You all are just gonna have to find some'n' better to do! [slams the doors shut and locks them.] 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89919,Butters,"Isn't this great, Father? Fresh mountain air, a nice warm fire, a nice warm fire. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89921,Butters,"Yeah, the Lord is pretty cool. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89932,Butters,"Happy birthday, Clyde! [behind him is Fr. Maxi. They both have gifts for Clyde.] Hope you don't mind I brought a friend. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89940,Butters,That's it! You're doing great! 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89942,Butters,Nobody's staring. I'm gonna get us some soda pop. You just mingle with the other fellas![skates off] 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89988,Butters,"Wow! Sure, Kyle. Be right back, Father. [follows Kyle away] "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89991,Butters,Huh-what's up? 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89993,Butters,"What are you saying, Kyle? "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89995,Butters,"Well, of course, you don't. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89997,Butters,"Well I'm sorry for tryin' to help out somebody who didn't have anywhere else to turn. We'll both just leave. I thought you were better than that, Kyle. [walks out] "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90008,Butters,"Father! Father? Has anybody seen my priest? Father, where'd you go? [Maxi is sitting by a Dumpster and raises his head when he hears Butters approaching. Butters then sees him] There you are! I've been looking everywhere. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90010,Butters,But you're missin' the party! 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90012,Butters,"[follows Maxi through the parking lot] But, they just don't understand you like I do. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90014,Butters,But it's not your fault. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90016,Butters,Why?! 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90018,Butters,But... I thought we were pals. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90022,Butters,Sometimes I wonder. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90024,Butters,...No thanks. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90026,Butters,No. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90028,Butters,"[perks up] Well, okay! [the bishop takes him to the back and opens the doors. Butters frowns] Stan? "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90073,Butters,Father. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90075,Butters,What?? No! 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90082,Butters,No. He can't. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90087,Butters,"Father, you did it! "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90089,Butters,Does that mean you're gonna stay? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90394,Butters,"Oh, hey fellas! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90396,Butters,What are you guys doing? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90398,Butters,"Well, sure! Whatcha lookin' for? [opens his overcoat. Inside, there are labels and packets for grape, orange, tropical passion, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavors taped across his shirt and coat.] I've got strawberry, vanilla, tropical passion... "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90400,Butters,Tropical passion. It's like mango and kiwi. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90402,Butters,"Yeah, and at five bucks a pop, we're gonna be rich! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90404,Butters,Oof. [falls to one side and his vape pens fall out of his jacket] 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90423,Butters,"[yelling] Why'd you punch me, Eric?! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90425,Butters,I thought we were partners! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90427,Butters,You punched me in the face! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90429,Butters,Well what's that supposed to mean?! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90431,Butters,"Well, I don't know how this means you can go and punch me in the face- "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90456,Butters,"Hi, Kyle! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90466,Butters,You know they took away their nap time. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90485,Butters,"Yeah, I wish I had a little pick-me-up! Somethin' fresh and fruity to go with my lunch! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90536,Butters,[returns with a crowbar and swings it into the vape dealer's kneecap] There! [runs away with the crow bar] 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90561,Butters,"[on the other sofa, leans to his right into view] Hey Kyle! [Kyle is rendered speechless. Cartman and Butters go to the door and stand on either side of Mr. Mackey.] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90582,Butters,'Cause Eric told them! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90584,Butters,"Please, Kyle! We still gotta pay people off! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90586,Butters,Run! 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90603,Butters,"Wow! You're so smart to think of a siphon, Kyle! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90628,Butters,"Does this mean we're out of the vaping business, fellas? "
22,5,The Scoots,90736,Butters,We're gonna get a butt-load of candy! 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91612,Butters,"Oh, boy! This is looking so great. [Stephen enters and takes a safety vest from the coat rack by the door] Hey, Dad! The big bike parade is this weekend. How's it look? First prize is $50! "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91628,Butters,"[joyfully] Yeah! Yippie! [Stan and friends sit on the curb. Butters honks his horn as he passes by] Hey, fellas, what'dya think? [Cartman, wearing his Buddha Box, lifts it up and looks] "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91630,Butters,How my decorations are coming. The big bike parade is this weekend. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91632,Butters,"Well, you won't think it's dumb when I win first prize. I'm goin' all out this year. I'll finally beat Larry Zewiski. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91638,Butters,"[head lowered] Well, anyway... [looks at the boys] well, I'm gettin' some more things for my bike too. [lowers his head again] Um... I'll see ya, fellas. [walks away slowly. The boys watch him leave] "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91740,Butters,Dad! [drops his comic book and goes to Stephen] 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91747,Butters,"Mom, eh if I win the first prize in the bike parade, I'll give the money to you guys. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91911,Butters,"[pulls out a gold covered bicycle by its handle from a box] Look Dad, a whole new bicycle! I'll win the bike parade for sure! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91923,Butters,"[riding up] Hey, Larry. [his gold and diamond encrusted pentacycle is quite blinged out, and he wears a matching crown] You gettin' excited for the bike parade? [Larry and the girls are stunned] Yeah, I guess I'm lookin' forward to it.  "
22,10,Bike Parade,91925,Butters,I guess my bike could be in the bike parade. I... I hadn't really thought about it. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91927,Butters,"Oh yeah. [presses a button on the handlebars and busts out the peacock feathers, complete with the shake at the end for maximum spread.] I'll see you there, Larry. Later, girls. [turns the bike around and rides away while pressing his bike horn. The girls look at Larry, who is smiling nervously at them and they walk away.] "
22,10,Bike Parade,91929,Butters,"[riding along on the street] Yippie! [he passes Towelie, who is on an e-scooter on the sidewalk] "
22,10,Bike Parade,92050,Butters,"[walks up and stands next to the Christmas tree] Hey Dad? I don't need anything more. I mean, if I don't win that bike parade, I don't care. I have you guys, and... that's more important than a bike parade will ever be. "
22,10,Bike Parade,92052,Butters,No I don't Dad. 
22,10,Bike Parade,92095,Butters,"Hey, Mom. Hi Dad. "
23,2,Band in China,92390,Butters, Get me off this farm!   
23,2,Band in China,92409,Butters,Who are you? 
23,2,Band in China,92416,Butters,Wow wee! 
23,2,Band in China,92430,Butters,"Yeah. As a matter of fact, two and a half, three weeks ago, I'd say. "
23,2,Band in China,92433,Butters,"Yeah, and then Stan came to me, and then I said ""Well I can play the drums."" "
23,2,Band in China,92435,Butters,"Well, so yeah, I, okay, I'll play guitar. "
23,2,Band in China,92443,Butters,"Well, I always liked Winnie the Pooh. "
23,2,Band in China,92466,Butters,"Yeah. And, we're gonna be rich. "
23,2,Band in China,92471,Butters,"Oh, that's okay, Jimmy. "
23,2,Band in China,92477,Butters,Yeah! And what's wrong with homosexuality anyway?! 
23,2,Band in China,92527,Butters,So there's not gonna be a biopic movie for us? 
23,2,Band in China,92530,Butters,Stinks to say goodbye to all that biopic money and glory. 
23,2,Band in China,92541,Butters,"Yeah! Whatever it is, I got it too! "
23,3,Shots,92597,Butters,"So then I guess the school said Eric can't come here no more, and so he's been, like, kicked out. "
23,3,Shots,92599,Butters,"Yeah, and he was actually kind of upset about it, because he said on the phone that he has to do homeschooling with this really mean teacher. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92772,Butters,"Yeah, it's the best. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92778,Butters,"But, but this is Sloppy Joe day. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92781,Butters,The girls? 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92783,Butters,"Yeah, it's supposed to be sloppy Joe day! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92786,Butters,"It's okay, Eric. I- "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92788,Butters,"Eric, Eric! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92790,Butters,"Eric, Eric? "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92811,Butters,"Comin' through! Make way! [the stop by Tolkien, Jimmy, and Craig] "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92822,Butters,"The protesters are tryin' to kill Eric again, Mr. Mackey. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92849,Butters,I looove barbecue rib day. 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92858,Butters,"You gotta calm down, Eric. Remember your condition, Eric. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92860,Butters,"Okay. that's it, Eric. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92862,Butters,Eric! 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92864,Butters,Somebody help! 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92903,Butters,"[weakly] It's taco Tuesday... [turns and walks forward. He gets his lunch, looks back at Eric, and heads for the boys table] "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92935,Butters,...Teacher? [she lifts up a finger and mumbles a bit. The lunch bell rings] 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92941,Butters,[flatly] -bury Steak day! [looks dejected] 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92943,Butters,"Eric, I. I just hate lying to you. I mean, you've been in the hospital. Twice. I feel guilty. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92945,Butters,"It's our lunches, Eric. It's... Incredible Meat. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92947,Butters,"No, Eric. See, there was this guy. He's a goo man. "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92971,Butters," [concerned, following him away.] Oh, God, Eric! What are you gonna do?! "
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92986,Butters,"[Sitting with Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Craig, Clyde and Scott] Oh, God. Someone's gonna die. "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93015,Butters,[looks around] Whoa. Very impressive. [strokes his chin] Indeed. [walks up to a plaque and reads it with a loupe] 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93017,Butters,"One minute, Dad! Archeologist Butters just needs to get his stamp and sticker for his autograph book. [gets a sticker of Baster and a stamp] Aha! another rare find! "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93019,Butters,"Well wait wait, we can't leave yet! I got all the stickers and tamps except for one! "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93021,Butters,Can I just check around one last time? 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93023,Butters,Well o-kay! 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93036,Butters,Been there... Saw that... Where's that stupid last sticker stamp? [sees a hallway he missed earlier] What's this? [he sees something ahead of him that excites him and runs to it. The sarcophagus of Took-tan Ra] 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93037,Butters,"Whoa... [gets to the exhibit and reads through his loupe] ""Sarcophagus and mummified remains of Egyptian royalty."" This is it! My last sticker! [gets ready to stamp his sticker book...] "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93039,Butters,But this is my last one! 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93041,Butters,"[looks at his sticker book] Haha, that's okay. I'm no ordinary child. I am Archeologist Butters! [stamps his sticker book and runs off happily. He doesn't notice the brief glow the stamp gives off] Happy Halloween, Mister! "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93056,Butters,"M-Mon? [two knocks] ...Dad? [the door bursts open and a mummy walks in. Butters screams as the mummy trashes the room. The mummy then grabs Butters... and hugs him. Butters calms down] A little... Why. Oh. Okay. Oh. Okay. Okay. Oh that's okay. [softly] That's okay. There you go. [the mummy lets go and sits on the bed next to him, presenting him with a gift] Form, for me? Oh, thank you. [takes the gift and opens it] Oh wow! A Fitbit! [the mummy murmurs something] Why thank you. Thank you. I... actually already have a Fitbit, but I could- "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93058,Butters,"I could give this one to a friend. [the mummy growls and stands up angrily] I just... I have one, so... [the mummy goes into a rage and finishes trashing the room, then just turns around and leaves] "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93063,Butters,Yes sir? 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93065,Butters,what... happened in town? 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93067,Butters,"[nervous] Oh, uh, a mummy, huh? That's, that's weird. "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93069,Butters,What?? The mummy talked to you?? 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93071,Butters,There was no argument. I just said I already had it and I'd give it to a friend. 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93073,Butters,"I, I just goh- "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93076,Butters,"No! I didn't throw the mummy out of the house! The mummy got all pissed off at me and left! [the officers look at each other, and Brown whips out his own notepad and starts writing] "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93078,Butters,"But I didn't do anything wrong! Okay, look officers, I think [cups his hands together nervously] I'm under some kind of curse. "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93092,Butters,"...and that's all that happened. I put that stamp in the sticker book, and now this mummy is destroying everything around me. I need help. "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93094,Butters,"Wuh-what, what do you mean? "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93096,Butters,"Wait. The mummy talked to you, too? "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93098,Butters,Why is it talking to everyone?! 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93100,Butters,No it doesn't! This is crazy! 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93102,Butters,"First of all, I don't have fun at school! And secondly... the mummy can do whatever it wants; I don't care! "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93115,Butters,"I have to end this curse, fellas. It's getting worse every day. Last night the mummy attacked my parents, and it said I was being narcissistic. It has no reason. No logic! One minute it's destroying everything, and the next it's sending me selfies like nothing ever happened. Look! [sure enough, there are several selfies of the mummy - in a park, in bed, working out - on his phone] This whole thing is so crazy it's starting to make me think I'm crazy! "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93117,Butters,"[jaw drops, then] It's a freaking mummy! Wouldn't you talk about it?! "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93120,Butters,"I would love that, but I don't have a choice! I swear, you guys. Mummies can smell fun! Whenever I'm somewhere, and I actually start havin' a good time, I get a call or a text from the mummy sayin' ""Hey, what are you doin'?"" Like it knows. "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93122,Butters,"Yeah. It is fun to get away and just talk to you guys. [the mummy pops up outside their window and throws its arms at it three times. The boys are spooked for a bit, then calm down] Oh, gosh darnit. [leaves the table] Hang on a second, fellas. [the mummy's eyes follow him] "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93145,Butters,What are you in for? I'm in here because *apparently* I'm a passive-aggressive controlling and manipulative psychopath whose narcissitic behavior drives other people crazy. 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93157,Butters,"So I said, ""Okay, fine. You don't ever do anything wrong! It's all me! You've got no problems, only I have problems! Alright, uh I'll lock my own ass up! Then we'll see who's got issues!"" "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93159,Butters,"I'll be in here, and something will go horribly wrong tonight, and then the monster will have to accept what it is, and finally work on changing, right? "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93181,Butters,[listening from his cell] The mummy! I told you! 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93203,Butters,I'm... [cups his hands together] I'm sorry? 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93205,Butters,"I'm so sorry. You're right. I can be selfish and narcissistic. Ah I'm gonna work on myself and... and try to make this curse work somehow. [the mummy rreaches into a back pocket and gives Butters a parting present, sighs, and walks over to a red car, opens the trunk, packs his suitcase, closes the trunk, gets into the driver's seat, puts on some sunglasses, and drives away. Butters open the present and reads the letter inside, which is just Egyptian hieroglyphics] "
23,6,Season Finale,93298,Butters,Oh Jeez. We should have never played football that close to the road. 
23,6,Season Finale,93300,Butters,"Wu-where are you going, Eric? "
23,7,Board Girls,93440,Butters,[quickly sits correctly] No sir! 
23,7,Board Girls,93449,Butters,"Okay. I jump up to the bugbear! And I yell ""FOR WATERDEEP!"" and I kick it in the balls! "
23,7,Board Girls,93490,Butters,In D&D they killed the dungeon master. [points to Cartman] Well we didn't even think it was possible to kill the dungeon master. 
23,7,Board Girls,93503,Butters,"Hey, that's not a bad idea. We've been taking it easy on the girls. Time to show 'em what real board gamers play. "
23,7,Board Girls,93569,Butters,"[steps forward, interrupting] The girls found Eric on the first round of Fury of Dracula! [smiles. Cartman glares at him and he wilts and backs away.] "
23,7,Board Girls,93574,Butters,"Wow, Scott. I didn't know it was that bad. "
23,7,Board Girls,93594,Butters,"[rushing in] Uh hey, fellas! Come quick! You gotta see! "
23,7,Board Girls,93596,Butters,"Well, it's the girls! They started their own board game club at the school! [runs out. The other boys look at each other] "
23,7,Board Girls,93602,Butters,"[he and the other boys enter the cafeteria] Well this is like what you said Dice Studz would be, Eric. "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94221,Butters,Well they just gotta get their Christmas spirits back. They just gotta. 
23,10,Christmas Snow,94254,Butters,"I'm sorry, Santa, I just can't think of anything I want this year. Well I guess maybe now I'm losing my Christmas Spirit. "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94256,Butters,"Neah. Mandalorian was great the first few episodes, but it's really fallin' apart lately. [a car screeches off-screen, a woman screams, and a crash occurs, followed by shattering glass. Santa sets Butters down, gets up and walks forward a bit] "
23,10,Christmas Snow,94289,Butters,"Yeah, that's a little too much holiday spirit, if you ask me. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94356,Butters,"Hey, Dad, do you think maybe we could go to Build-A-Bear today? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94358,Butters,"But they said they were open again, so I- "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94614,Butters,"[muttering to himself] March 16th. It was March 16th! That's how long it's been! It was supposed to be a party! A big, happy gathering at Build-A-Bear to celebrate me being a big boy at the dentist! Then they shut it all down. They said I'd have to wait until April. And then it was May. And then they said, ""Wait until summer."" It's fucking October now! [swats his lunch away, then hops onto the table to rant. Four officers behind him by the wall react] Why doesn't anyone tell me the truth?! [grabs Monica's lunch then throws that away] That I'm never going to Build-A-Bear! [one of the officers taps his baton against his anti-riot shield, and two officers to his left move forward] That I'm never going ever again! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94616,Butters,"I'm never going to Build-A-Bear, am I?! [the officers flank him] Oh, hey teachers. Sorry. [they carry him out of the cafeteria] W-wait, I'm sorry. I don't need to go to Build-A-Bear! Fellas?! [the other kids are stunned] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94703,Butters,Wha? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94705,Butters,"Okay. Save me from what? [nods off, and Stan walks to the middle of the gym] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94751,Butters,"I sure am, fellas! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94756,Butters,Whoa! Is it really for reals? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94765,Butters,"Oh! Good job, Stan! Thanks for getting my hopes up, you asshole! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94786,Butters,"Oh boy, is this a dream? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94788,Butters,The Caballero Grizzly. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94792,Butters,Wow! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94794,Butters,Aaaah! God! Daaagh! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94810,Butters,"We gotta surrender, fellas. I'm honestly not having that much fun anyway. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94887,Butters,"[from the window] Hey, fellas! [the boys turn around facing the house] Anything fun happen at school today?! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94889,Butters,"Oh, my gosh! That sounds like so much fun! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95204,Butters,Yeah! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95206,Butters,I just wanted to believe in something that would get me out of the house! I didn't give a shit what it was. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95390,Butters,Guess that's just part of being a kid these days. 
25,1,Pajama Day,95476,Butters,[he raises his hand] We could shoot up the school! 
25,1,Pajama Day,95503,Butters,Wuh huh huh?! Yes? 
25,1,Pajama Day,95505,Butters,"Uh, no, sir! "
25,1,Pajama Day,95507,Butters,Uh... Huh... He... 
25,2,The Big Fix,95603,Butters,"Hey, we never hang out just you and me either, Stan! "
25,2,The Big Fix,95719,Butters,Yup! 
25,3,City People,95820,Butters,"Well– Well, sure Eric! What's goin' on? "
25,3,City People,95822,Butters,"[he closes the door]Oh... Oh, and you're worried that maybe now your mom won't always be there to take care of you? "
25,3,City People,95824,Butters,"Well, not really. "
25,3,City People,95826,Butters,"Wow! Well, that sounds like a good deal! "
25,3,City People,95828,Butters,[excitedly] Wow wee! 
25,3,City People,95830,Butters,"Gosh, thanks, Eric! [he takes the picture] "
25,3,City People,95924,Butters,"Yeah, it's real roomy! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96060,Butters,"Hi, Josslyn! Hi, Staci Mae! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96064,Butters,"Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96096,Butters,"I'll do my best, Dad! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96098,Butters,That kid? 
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96101,Butters,"Oh, Jesus! Not Melancholy! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96103,Butters,"[he clicks his tongue] Come on, boy! [Melancholy stops and begins pooping on the floor] "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96105,Butters,"Well, I dunno! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96107,Butters,"[tongue clicking] Come on, Melancholy, come on! [A slide whistle is heard and Melancholy gets a boner] "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96110,Butters,"What is what? [he looks down] Oh, geez! Put that thing away, Melancholy! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96115,Butters,"Hello, sir. I just needed to talk to somebody. I've been having some problems at home. "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96117,Butters,"Well, it's just my parents. You see, a few months ago, I saw this little girl riding a pony and I said, ""Whoa! I wanna do that!"" "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96119,Butters,"So we found a stable and a trainer, and I started to learn dressage. And I got to lease a pony, and his name is Melancholy. "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96121,Butters,"Well, I love to ride Melancholy. But now I'm feeling all this pressure to win. My parents said I have to win because it's against the Russians. "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96123,Butters,"It's the Russians. I mean, I guess they're just really good at dressage, but now my dad says it's a matter of national security. "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96125,Butters,Don't move my head? I – 
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96127,Butters,"Well, o-okay, but I kind of am asking you for help, ya know, because I'm feeling really lost and miserable. "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96129,Butters,"Well, they said if I don't do well at dressage, it could mean the end of all of our freedoms. "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96132,Butters,"We need to have a serious talk, Melancholy, and I need you to listen. [he stops walking and turns to look at Melancholy] There's a time to poop, and there's a time to work. And the best thing is to poop when your work is done. I-It's like when I'm in the classroom, sometimes I have to poop, but I have to wait until lunch break. If I really have to go, I can raise my hand and ask politely. But if you start to poop while we're competin', the judges are gonna deduct points. And then the Russians will beat us, and then you're gonna get turned into Chinese skin cream! [he approaches Melancholy to pet him] We have to do this, Melancholy. You and me have to focus like never before. Now, let's go show them what we can do! [he gets on the horse saddle with a look of determination on his face] Let's go! [he clicks his tongue] "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96134,Butters,"That's it! You got it, boy! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96136,Butters,"Nope! Nope! Melancholy! Over the jump, boy! [he attempts to make Melancholy go forward, but no luck] Come on, Melancholy! [Melancholy begins to trot away] What? W-Where are you going? [Butters tries to gain control of Melancholy] Melancholy, back to the jump! Whoa, Melancholy, Whoa!! W-What are you doing now? "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96138,Butters,"Now I'm not sure what's going on here. [the girl on the other horse screams as this continues on] No! No! No! Melancholy! Bad pony! I'm sorry, ma'am! Melancholy, to the jump! "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96166,Butters,"This is it, Melancholy. We have to do this. We have to be classy. We're not gonna poop, we're not gonna get a boner, and we're certainly not gonna have unwarranted sex with the ladies. Please, boy... we have got to get this right. "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96222,Butters,"It's ok, Melancholy...we did our best...[Melancholy starts moving erratically] Whoa! Where you goin', Melancholy? "
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96228,Butters,Melancholy! Bad! 
25,4,Back To The Cold War,96234,Butters, Waaaghhaaagh! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96589,Butters,[singing] Loo loo loo! It's St. Patrick's Day! Looo loo loo! De doot be do! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96591,Butters,"Okay, mom! [he gets to the living room, where Stephen is reading a newspaper] Ohhh dad, are you wearin' green or are you gonna get a pinch? "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96594,Butters,Okay! Well someone's gettin a pinch today! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96596,Butters,"Hey, Clyde! You got your green on! Hey Jimmy! Nice green pants! Tee-hee! Te hee hee hee! [he walks to the boys, who also are wearing green] Happy St. Patrick's Day, fellas! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96598,Butters,You guys all look very festive! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96600,Butters,"Oh, I hope they put green food coloring in our milk at lunchtime again like last year! [he notices a girl walking by him, who's apparently not wearing green] Uh-oh! Hey, Kelly-Ann! What's going on? "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96602,Butters,Looks like someone forgot what day it was! Ha ha! Pi-i-i-i-nch! [he pinches her] 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96604,Butters,"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do anything wrong, honest! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96606,Butters,"I'm so sorry! Please! It's just... Well, she had it comin' on account of the way she was dressed! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96610,Butters,"Oh, jeez, I didn't know Kelly-Ann was a minor! Well, she didn't have a mining helmet or a pick axe or anything! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96613,Butters,"But... But, sir, it's St. Patrick's Day. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96615,Butters,Yes! Right! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96631,Butters,Yes? 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96633,Butters,"Ugh... Okay... Oh, God...  "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96635,Butters,"Wul, it's just... I mean... What you're wearing. You know, it's St. Patrick's Day, you're not wearing any... You don't have any green socks on, do you? "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96637,Butters,Ohhhhh God... I wanna pinch you so bad... 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96639,Butters,"No, ma'am, could you... Maybe put on some green lipstick or something? "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96641,Butters,"Well, technically, yes! I mean, St. Patrick's Day is a wonderful day where we remember a British Roman man who went to Ireland and converted the whole country to Christianity! And he used a clover to represent the Holy Trinity, so we're supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you don't wear green you get a pinch! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96643,Butters,See?! That's the problem! Nobody knows how great he really was. 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96645,Butters,"Oh, God... "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96647,Butters,"I didn't finger nothin! I swear it was just a tiny little St. Patrick's Day pinch! It was... It was like this! [he pinches her hand, who slaps him in return] Ohhhg! [she slaps him again] Oh! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96649,Butters,Ohhgu! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96655,Butters,"[starts praying] Dear St. Patrick... If you're really up there... I've always done my best to honor you on this most holy day... You went to Ireland, and you got all those pagan worshippers to follow Christ. If there's any way... that you could help me now... just, like, send me a leprechaun or something... I will be forever your dark servant. Amen. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96659,Butters,Whoa...  
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96662,Butters,"Wow wee, are you a real leprechaun? "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96664,Butters,Alright! Are we gonna bust outta here or what? 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96702,Butters,"[narrating] St. Patrick was not Irish. He was a Roman British man who was made a slave by Irish Barbarians. But St. Patrick heard the voice of God... and he used his situation for good, and God told him to be brave! [he's standing on the toilet, telling the story to the other detainees] And that is why... On this one day of the year, we must be like St. Patrick ourselves! [one of them farts] The police don't even care about St. Patrick's Day! Do you see any of them wearing green?! No! If we do St. Patrick's bidding, he will provide for us! [meanwhile, the officer from before brings Randy back to the cell] "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96704,Butters,Pi-i-i-i-nch! [he pinches the officer's leg] 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96717,Butters,"Whu... Oh, hey, fellas. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96719,Butters,Pretty good. 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96722,Butters,What are you gonna do? 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96724,Butters,"I knew St. Patrick would perform a miracle to get us out of here! Just like when he was a slave, he will help us go free! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96737,Butters,"It is not over! What did St. Patrick say when he was taken from his homeland and turned into a slave?! St. Patrick didn't give up! And when the Christians slandered him while he was trying to convert the heathen Irish, did he give up then?! [Randy ignores him and rushes to the bars in anger] "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96742,Butters,Yeah! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96744,Butters,"You see?! The power of St. Patrick compels you! [Randy fires rainbows from his hands, blasting the officers away] "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96746,Butters,"Yes, now use your clover rays! [Randy fires his clover rays on another two officers, sending them spinning away] "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96781,Butters,Uh oh! [he flees] 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96785,Butters,"Wahggh! [he notices other two cars, with Yates and other two officers pointing their guns at him] "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96787,Butters,Ahghggh! [he's now surrounded] 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96792,Butters,It's him! It's St. Patrick! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96813,Butters,Once again... I shoulda never listened to what they told me in church. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96828,Butters,"Hey, fellas! Loved that last TikTok! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97067,Butters,"[Butters is giving love letters to some of the students.] Happy Valentine’s Day, Clyde! Here’s a Valentine for you, Red! "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97098,Butters,"Mario Brothers, Kyle?! You seriously can’t do better than Mario Brothers?! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97174,Butters,"It stinks, doesn't it? "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97176,Butters,"When people make certain judgements about you. I've been watching you, Kyle, and I can see your having some problems with your brand. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97179,Butters,"You see, everyone has an image, Kyle. Some kids call it your credibility, or your reputation, but those things are just little parts of something much more important -- your brand. Think about it, Kyle. Who are you? "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97181,Butters,"See? You don't know what your brand is. So how is anyone else supposed to know? It's like a commercial for Kyle, but you're not putting a label on the jar. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97183,Butters,"That's because I've been workin' on my brand. My parents saw that my brand wasn't working with people, so they sent me to brand management. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97186,Butters,"Hi, Mr. Davis! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97188,Butters,"Great! I made two friends, and a girl asked me to help her with her homework. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97190,Butters,"My friend Kyle here was thinking of reworking his brand a bit, and I told him maybe you could help. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97237,Butters,"You'll see, Kyle. When you have your brand up and runnin', no one can stop you. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97338,Butters,"Yeah, everyone likes a guy that's strong and assertive, so I told Bebe to go fuck herself. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97340,Butters,"You want some more of this, you dumb slut?! "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97342,Butters,"Hey, Kyle, will you relax? You're kind of fucking up my brand. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97345,Butters,"Fuck you, you fucking bitch! "

26,3,Japanese Toilet,97578,Butters,"Well, um, you're just a really good friend, Stan, and -- and I was gonna ask if maybe I could borrow your plungercost? "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97580,Butters,"It doesn't cost nothing when your toilet's nice as yours, Richie Rich! [he laughs, with the other kids joining in as well] I did it! I called Stan Richie Rich, too! That was fun! [he walks away] "
26,4,Deep Learning,97749,Butters,"Oh, uh... thanks. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97769,Butters,"Right, but then you went and blabbed about it to Clyde. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97851,Butters,ChatGPT! 
26,4,Deep Learning,97862,Butters,What are we gonna do?! 
26,4,Deep Learning,97867,Butters,"Okay, Eric, could you explain exactly how women ruined slavery? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97972,Butters,"Fellas! Hey, fellas, you're not gonna believe it! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97974,Butters,I got a job over at the ice cream shop! Guess what? I got my very first paycheck! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97976,Butters,"My dad told me if I got a job, we could put my paychecks in my very own bank account. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97979,Butters,"Yeah, well, I guess these days it's really hard for businesses to find people to work, so they'll take whatever they can get. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,97981,Butters,"It's what they call the Great Resignation Labor Shortage. So now, if you have your parents' permission, there are some jobs they'll even let kids do. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98002,Butters,"Loo, loo, loo, I'm serving ice cream. Loo, loo, loo, you'll eat it too. Loo, loo, loo, I'm serving ice cream... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98004,Butters,"Okay, and the pistachio maple cream. Let me know if you need extra napkins for your table, and have a creamy day! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98006,Butters,"Oh, hey, Eric! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98008,Butters,What are you talking about? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98010,Butters,"Well, but, Eric, this is my job. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98012,Butters,"Eric, there's a lot more to it than that, and I already do this job, so... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98014,Butters,"Oh. Yes, Mr. Sullivan. I was just... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98017,Butters,"Uh, oh, uh... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98019,Butters,"Um, okay. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98023,Butters,"Alright, Eric. So there's three types of ice cream: waffle cone, sugar cone, and cups. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98025,Butters,"Well, you get a ten-minute break every two hours, but only after you check all the freezers, which are right over there, and need to always be set to 0°. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98027,Butters,"Eric, please, I don't want to lose this job... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98029,Butters,"Oh. Hello, sir. Hope you're having a creamy day. What can I get for you? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98031,Butters,"Okay. Eric, can you scoop out some coconut almond fudge? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98033,Butters,"Because it's your job, Eric. "

26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98039,Butters,"Oh, sorry, sir. Eric? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98041,Butters,"Eric! Eric, you can't just sit there at a table. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98043,Butters,So? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98045,Butters,"I don't care if it's Bare Minimum Monday! Eric, you need to... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98051,Butters,"I know, sir. I'm sorry. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98053,Butters,He hasn't come back from his break yet. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98055,Butters,Yes? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98060,Butters,"Ah! Eric, where are you? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98063,Butters,"Uh, Eric says he's going to work from home. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98066,Butters,"Eric, you need to come here right now or we're both gonna get fired! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98069,Butters,"Okay, thanks for coming, and have a creamy day. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98070,Butters,"Hi, hope you're having a creamy day. Can I help you? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98072,Butters,"Eric, could you please fill this nice lady's order? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98080,Butters,Eric! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98093,Butters,"No. No, no, no. Thank you, no. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98096,Butters,But I like my ice cream job. I don't want to open a hot dog. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98098,Butters,"Yeah, but this is my money. I worked hard for it. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98102,Butters,"Uh, I just give a bit of my paycheck every week to you guys? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98104,Butters,"Oh, okay. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98125,Butters,Are you guys just playing around? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98127,Butters,Then why did you name it DikinBaus? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98129,Butters,"Well, stop being creative and open the goddamn restaurant so I can get my money back! So stop dicking around and wasting my money. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98152,Butters,"Oh. Hey, Mom and Dad. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98154,Butters,"Well, yeah. It was a pretty long night. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98156,Butters,What? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98158,Butters,$0? But I've been working every day! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98166,Butters,That son-of-a-gun! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98172,Butters,"Gosh dang it, Eric! What the hell do you think you're doing? You can just take my money out of my gosh dang bank account without my permission... "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98174,Butters,Where's all the money gone from my bank account? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98176,Butters,You said you'd never access my account without my permission! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98180,Butters,"Then open the stupid place, Eric! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98228,Butters,"Hey, fellas. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98230,Butters,You haven't made any money. 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98232,Butters,[extremely furious] Gosh dang it! 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98234,Butters,"Attention, everyone! DikinBaus is now open for business. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98235,Butters,Welcome to DikinBaus. How can I help you? 
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98236,Butters,"There you are, ma'am! Thank you! "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98249,Butters,"Oh, I made my money back, huh? "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98251,Butters,"Yeah, I wasn't thinking that. See, all I ever wanted was just to do my job, learn how to work, and help Mr. Sullivan sell ice cream. So I'm thinking I'm actually going to conduct a market analysis to look for potential buyers and roll over the company as an exit strategy. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98253,Butters,"Yeah, so that's why I want to approach overseas investors who will buy the IP, the restaurant operations, and the real estate outright. "
26,5,DikinBaus Hot Dogs,98255,Butters,"Yeah, I thought of that too. Come on in. "
