1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,34,Stan,Dude! Visitors! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,37,Stan,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,39,Stan,Visitors are real. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,44,Stan,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,53,Stan,They took him on their ship. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,60,Stan,"Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,80,Stan,"Good morning, Miss Crabtree. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,84,Stan,"Oh, don't worry about him. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,87,Stan,"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,89,Stan,I said I have a bad itch. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,106,Stan,"Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,109,Stan,"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,111,Stan,"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,139,Stan,"[Whispering.] Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,141,Stan,Dude! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,159,Stan,Dude! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,163,Stan,It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,179,Stan,How can you eat when you're farting fire? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,182,Stan,[Gasps.] Where? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,185,Stan,"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,187,Stan,I do not! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,191,Stan,Bleech! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,195,Stan,[He glances at it.] Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,200,Stan,[That gets his attention.] What? How do you know she has a cat? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,211,Stan,"Uh, Chef? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,213,Stan,Chef. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,215,Stan,Chef! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,217,Stan,[shouts loud enough for Chef to hear] CHEF!!! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,223,Stan,Visitors took Kyle's baby brother. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,230,Stan,Whoa! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,243,Stan,"Killer! Thanks, Chef. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,249,Stan,"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,256,Stan,What the hell was that? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,269,Stan,"Kyle, look! It's them. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,272,Stan,Oh my God! They killed Kenny! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,276,Stan,"Hey look, [Kenny gets up.] I think Kenny's okay. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,279,Stan,Owww. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,282,Stan,"Wow, poor Kenny. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,287,Stan,"Dude, Kenny is dead! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,289,Stan,See? 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,297,Stan,"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,300,Stan,"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. [He hurries away.] "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,327,Stan,But her note said she'd be here. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,330,Stan,Bleech! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,335,Stan,Bleech! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,365,Stan,Bleech! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,367,Stan,"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,388,Stan,"Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,392,Stan,I think we have to signal them somehow. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,398,Stan,"Come on Cartman, fart! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,400,Stan,[To Kyle and Wendy.] He can't hold it in forever. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,405,Stan,"Hey, it's happening again. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,408,Stan,"Now, do you believe us, Cartman? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,410,Stan,"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,421,Stan,"Come down here, you stinking aliens! [Three Visitors appear.] "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,423,Stan,"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,425,Stan,Yeah. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,427,Stan,"That was beautiful, dude. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,429,Stan,"No, they're leaving. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,431,Stan,"Whoa, dude! "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,433,Stan,"Hey Wendy, what's a fuck? [She shrugs.] "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,459,Stan,"Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,469,Stan,"Thanks for your help, Wendy. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,471,Stan,"Hey, I didn't throw up. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,474,Stan,Bleech! 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,477,Stan,Sorry. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,479,Stan,Cool. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,481,Stan,I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,484,Stan,"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,486,Stan,I don't know what the hell that is... 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,488,Stan,"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,490,Stan,I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows. 
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,499,Stan,"Oh, hey Cartman. "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,502,Stan,"Really, what about? "
1,1,Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,504,Stan,"That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,510,Stan,"Yeah, it was huge. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,513,Stan,"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,515,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,519,Stan,What were you talking about? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,531,Stan,"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,540,Stan,"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,569,Stan,"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,574,Stan,"Yeah, that'd be cool. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,622,Stan,"[Turning to face Cartman.] We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,624,Stan,"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,626,Stan,Dolphins are way smarter than you! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,628,Stan,"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,630,Stan,Tell me what you wrote about! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,632,Stan,"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,668,Stan,What? You've got to weight 90 pounds. 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,675,Stan,What's that stuff? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,678,Stan,Super fat-ass? 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,710,Stan,Take that you stupid Indian! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,739,Stan,Shut up Cartman! 
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,790,Stan,"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,822,Stan,"Wendy, look! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,831,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, stop! "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,848,Stan,"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,870,Stan,"What about, not holding anything against the person who wins? "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,878,Stan,"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches. "
1,2,Weight Gain 4000,889,Stan,We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison. 
1,3,Volcano,909,Stan,"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo? "
1,3,Volcano,925,Stan,"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman. "
1,3,Volcano,934,Stan,"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer. "
1,3,Volcano,945,Stan,"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman. "
1,3,Volcano,947,Stan,"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says. "
1,3,Volcano,951,Stan,"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa. "
1,3,Volcano,956,Stan,"Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there. "
1,3,Volcano,962,Stan,"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo. "
1,3,Volcano,973,Stan,Is this hunting? 
1,3,Volcano,987,Stan,I can't. 
1,3,Volcano,990,Stan,I don't wanna shoot the bunny. 
1,3,Volcano,992,Stan,"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny. "
1,3,Volcano,995,Stan,"I can shoot you, fat ass! "
1,3,Volcano,997,Stan,I'll kill you! 
1,3,Volcano,1061,Stan,"Yeah, Cartman's pee. "
1,3,Volcano,1068,Stan,"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too. "
1,3,Volcano,1073,Stan,Whatabutt? 
1,3,Volcano,1075,Stan,Why? 
1,3,Volcano,1079,Stan,A hook. 
1,3,Volcano,1082,Stan,Celery? 
1,3,Volcano,1086,Stan,"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories. "
1,3,Volcano,1092,Stan,Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets. 
1,3,Volcano,1104,Stan,"What, dude? "
1,3,Volcano,1106,Stan,Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned? 
1,3,Volcano,1108,Stan,"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore? "
1,3,Volcano,1110,Stan,What? 
1,3,Volcano,1119,Stan,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing! "
1,3,Volcano,1121,Stan,Yeah. 
1,3,Volcano,1181,Stan,Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg? 
1,3,Volcano,1185,Stan,No! 
1,3,Volcano,1187,Stan,I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal! 
1,3,Volcano,1208,Stan,I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard. 
1,3,Volcano,1211,Stan,"Ah, damn it, I can't do it! "
1,3,Volcano,1215,Stan,Cartman? 
1,3,Volcano,1265,Stan,"Whoa, he built a wicker basket. "
1,3,Volcano,1288,Stan,"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. "
1,3,Volcano,1292,Stan,"Hey, that was easy! "
1,3,Volcano,1295,Stan,What?! Why?! 
1,3,Volcano,1298,Stan,No. 
1,3,Volcano,1303,Stan,"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny. "
1,3,Volcano,1306,Stan,"Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1311,Stan,"Hiya, Sparky. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1313,Stan,That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1315,Stan,"Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy? "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1317,Stan,He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1320,Stan,He's not meaner than Sparky. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1323,Stan,Sparky'll kick his ass. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1327,Stan,"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1330,Stan,Sparky! Bad dog! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1332,Stan,What?! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1334,Stan,What do you mean? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1337,Stan,He's just confused. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1341,Stan,"Sick, shut up dude! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1360,Stan,Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1377,Stan,Huh? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1385,Stan,"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1387,Stan,"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1390,Stan,"Get down, Sparky! Down! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1407,Stan,"Um, I'm not really prepared either. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1409,Stan,"Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it- "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1412,Stan,"Wow, cool! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1421,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question? "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1423,Stan,What's a... homosexual? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1427,Stan,I guess. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1433,Stan,"Shut up, dude! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1435,Stan,"Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf? "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1438,Stan,"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1440,Stan,"Good boy, now shake. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1442,Stan,"Good boy. Now, don't be gay. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1444,Stan,"Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1447,Stan,I don't know. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1453,Stan,"Come on you guys, I have an idea. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1472,Stan,"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't- "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1474,Stan,"Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1476,Stan,"No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1481,Stan,"Atta boy, Spark! Get her! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1483,Stan,Yes! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1485,Stan,Ah crap! Now what do I do? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1489,Stan,"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1491,Stan,Like who? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1501,Stan,"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1505,Stan,Damn it! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1507,Stan,I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1509,Stan,Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1511,Stan,"No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1513,Stan,I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1550,Stan,"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1564,Stan,I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1575,Stan,"Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1577,Stan,I think he might've run away. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1580,Stan,I'm not playing. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1582,Stan,I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves] 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1597,Stan,Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1609,Stan,Sparky! Sparky! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1624,Stan,"Fine, how are you? "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1626,Stan,My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1628,Stan,Do you have lots of gay dogs here? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1632,Stan,"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1669,Stan,"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'? "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1671,Stan,"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1673,Stan,"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1675,Stan,We can work on making you not gay together. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1677,Stan,Sparky? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1679,Stan,What don't I understand? 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1725,Stan,"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1744,Stan,"Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1747,Stan,"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1752,Stan,"I will Big Gay Al, I will. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1769,Stan,I've been getting my best friend back. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1776,Stan,Hike! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1779,Stan,Mph! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1796,Stan,Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys. 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1798,Stan,And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1800,Stan,And it's okay to be gay! 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1803,Stan,"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1806,Stan,"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1808,Stan,"It's true, I'll show you. "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1810,Stan,But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club... 
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1819,Stan,"Oh, there you are dude. How's it going? "
1,4,Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,1824,Stan,Wow! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1835,Stan,"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1837,Stan,No! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1839,Stan,She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1842,Stan,"My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1844,Stan,"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1847,Stan,Yeah. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1849,Stan,Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1851,Stan,"Wow, that's cool! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1855,Stan,"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1876,Stan,That'd be cool! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1889,Stan,"Wait, wait. We still need a pig. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1897,Stan,Okay. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1899,Stan,[Despondantly.] Yes... 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1903,Stan,"Oh, neither. It's my sister. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1911,Stan,Hi Shelly. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1913,Stan,Headgear? What headgear? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1915,Stan,"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1919,Stan,"No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1922,Stan,Go where? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1940,Stan,"Yeah, quit being such a baby. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1942,Stan,At least I'm not a little pig-fucker! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1962,Stan,Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1973,Stan,Ow! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1989,Stan,"Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,1992,Stan,"Yeah! Go away, Pip! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2025,Stan,I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2028,Stan,So how do we do that? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2031,Stan,"Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2033,Stan,"Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2035,Stan,Shut up Cartman! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2040,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2044,Stan,"Sick dude, she's my sister. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2049,Stan,Crap. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2053,Stan,"No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2055,Stan,"Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2057,Stan,"No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2070,Stan,"Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2092,Stan,Sick! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2118,Stan,"Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2134,Stan,"Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2139,Stan,A big mutant version of me? 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2155,Stan,I bet he weighs four hundred pounds. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2158,Stan,Oh my God! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2171,Stan,"Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2179,Stan,"It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2185,Stan,Stop! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2188,Stan,"That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2193,Stan,"Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister? "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2196,Stan,"...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2198,Stan,"No! Shelly bad, you good. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2200,Stan,"He's tearing up the house, stop him! "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2202,Stan,"Come on Kyle, Cartman. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2220,Stan,"Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2222,Stan,You can't just leave me here alone. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2225,Stan,Thanks a lot. 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2228,Stan,It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! (Starts sobbing)! 
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2237,Stan,"Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2239,Stan,"Uh, ahh, oooh. "
1,5,An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig,2252,Stan,"Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby! "
1,6,Death,2278,Stan,"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on. "
1,6,Death,2280,Stan,"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I? "
1,6,Death,2282,Stan,"Aw, dammit! "
1,6,Death,2289,Stan,Heheheh hehehe... 
1,6,Death,2295,Stan,"My name's not Billy, grandpa. It's Stan. "
1,6,Death,2297,Stan,Sure. 
1,6,Death,2299,Stan,"I'm not gonna kill you, grandpa. "
1,6,Death,2301,Stan,'Cause I'll get in trouble. 
1,6,Death,2303,Stan,"Leave me alone, grandpa. "
1,6,Death,2342,Stan,"I'm not going to kill you, grandpa! "
1,6,Death,2344,Stan,"Good night, grandpa. "
1,6,Death,2377,Stan,"Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there, Kenny! "
1,6,Death,2387,Stan,Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to? 
1,6,Death,2390,Stan,"My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should. "
1,6,Death,2392,Stan,Really?? 
1,6,Death,2394,Stan,Wow! 
1,6,Death,2396,Stan,"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison? "
1,6,Death,2404,Stan,"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late. "
1,6,Death,2406,Stan,Yeah... 
1,6,Death,2409,Stan,Hey Chef. 
1,6,Death,2411,Stan,Bad. 
1,6,Death,2413,Stan,"Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa? "
1,6,Death,2415,Stan,"No, I mean, kill my grandpa. "
1,6,Death,2417,Stan,"See, I told you dude. "
1,6,Death,2422,Stan,What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this??? 
1,6,Death,2440,Stan,"Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay. "
1,6,Death,2442,Stan,"No grandpa, I'll get in trouble. "
1,6,Death,2444,Stan,"No, I can't even kill a deer. "
1,6,Death,2451,Stan,Grandpa! 
1,6,Death,2458,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, he's just trying to get to you. "
1,6,Death,2461,Stan,We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen. 
1,6,Death,2464,Stan,"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes. "
1,6,Death,2466,Stan,"I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die. "
1,6,Death,2468,Stan,"Hey, yeah! "
1,6,Death,2488,Stan,Jesus? 
1,6,Death,2490,Stan,"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay? "
1,6,Death,2492,Stan,Yes? 
1,6,Death,2496,Stan,Goddammit! 
1,6,Death,2498,Stan,What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
1,6,Death,2501,Stan,"Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole! "
1,6,Death,2512,Stan,"Okay, grandpa, okay. Just get out of the way of the TV. "
1,6,Death,2528,Stan,"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it. "
1,6,Death,2532,Stan,Aaah!! 
1,6,Death,2542,Stan,"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and... "
1,6,Death,2567,Stan,"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever. "
1,6,Death,2570,Stan,"Aww, do I have to? "
1,6,Death,2575,Stan,"Hey, what are you doing?! "
1,6,Death,2581,Stan,"Uh, I guess. "
1,6,Death,2583,Stan,"Okay, you, you can let me out now. "
1,6,Death,2586,Stan,"Let me out, grandpa! "
1,6,Death,2588,Stan,"I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. "
1,6,Death,2594,Stan,"Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand. "
1,6,Death,2596,Stan,"Sure I will grandpa, I will. "
1,6,Death,2615,Stan,"Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. [To Kyle.] You got the cow all tied up? "
1,6,Death,2617,Stan,"'Kay, come on guys. "
1,6,Death,2620,Stan,"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted. "
1,6,Death,2632,Stan,"Are you ready, grandpa? "
1,6,Death,2639,Stan,"Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you. "
1,6,Death,2642,Stan,What is that?! 
1,6,Death,2652,Stan,"Hey, he's coming towards us. "
1,6,Death,2667,Stan,"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him! "
1,6,Death,2669,Stan,"Yeah, but, mom! "
1,6,Death,2672,Stan,"Dad, Death is coming! "
1,6,Death,2677,Stan,"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place. "
1,6,Death,2681,Stan,Good point man. 
1,6,Death,2684,Stan,Ahhhh! 
1,6,Death,2709,Stan,[Noticing.] Hey look! 
1,6,Death,2741,Stan,"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time. "
1,6,Death,2746,Stan,Whoa! 
1,6,Death,2757,Stan,"Come on you guys, let's go home. "
1,6,Death,2762,Stan,What do you mean? 
1,6,Death,2778,Stan,"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes. "
1,6,Death,2781,Stan,Cool! 
1,6,Death,2784,Stan,What are you doing grandpa? 
1,6,Death,2786,Stan,That's my silly grandpa. 
1,7,Pinkeye,2799,Stan,Oh my God! They killed Kenny! 
1,7,Pinkeye,2809,Stan,"Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2831,Stan,Shut up Kyle! 
1,7,Pinkeye,2833,Stan,I'm Raggedy Andy. 
1,7,Pinkeye,2835,Stan,"Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2837,Stan,Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy. 
1,7,Pinkeye,2843,Stan,Where'd you get that? 
1,7,Pinkeye,2847,Stan,"No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass! "
1,7,Pinkeye,2851,Stan,"I'll kick your ass, Kyle! "
1,7,Pinkeye,2854,Stan,"Hey look, Kenny's not dead. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2856,Stan,"Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you? "
1,7,Pinkeye,2867,Stan,"Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2869,Stan,"I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank."" "
1,7,Pinkeye,2884,Stan,"Whoa, dude! "
1,7,Pinkeye,2891,Stan,Wendy? 
1,7,Pinkeye,2893,Stan,"You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember? "
1,7,Pinkeye,2895,Stan,We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair. 
1,7,Pinkeye,2897,Stan,You what?! 
1,7,Pinkeye,2937,Stan,"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2988,Stan,"Oh man, I feel like a total choad. "
1,7,Pinkeye,2995,Stan,"Hey, where's Kyle? "
1,7,Pinkeye,2998,Stan,"Whoa, dude! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3008,Stan,"Yeah, me too. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3017,Stan,"Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3019,Stan,I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3043,Stan,I bet I get more candy than you dude. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3045,Stan,"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3047,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3051,Stan,"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight... "
1,7,Pinkeye,3053,Stan,Plastic pumpkin pails... 
1,7,Pinkeye,3055,Stan,Taser... 
1,7,Pinkeye,3058,Stan,"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3072,Stan,[Pointedly.] How's your barrel full of candy Wendy? 
1,7,Pinkeye,3076,Stan,"I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3079,Stan,"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3081,Stan,"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3114,Stan,"Dude, Kenny! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3120,Stan,"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3153,Stan,"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3180,Stan,What are you talking about Chef? 
1,7,Pinkeye,3184,Stan,"Oh my God, that means... "
1,7,Pinkeye,3192,Stan,"Wait, where are we going? "
1,7,Pinkeye,3197,Stan,I don't know about this Chef. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3201,Stan,What are we doing here Chef? 
1,7,Pinkeye,3205,Stan,What? 
1,7,Pinkeye,3209,Stan,We told you dude. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3213,Stan,Hey Chef. Look 
1,7,Pinkeye,3224,Stan,"Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? "
1,7,Pinkeye,3230,Stan,Let's get out of here! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3235,Stan,We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3237,Stan,You call the number Kyle. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3239,Stan,We'll hold 'em off. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3246,Stan,Sweet! 
1,7,Pinkeye,3252,Stan,Wendy? 
1,7,Pinkeye,3255,Stan,"I know, but uh-... but... "
1,7,Pinkeye,3257,Stan,"Hey, yeah! "
1,7,Pinkeye,3262,Stan,"[Apologetically.] Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3270,Stan,"I, I can't. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3276,Stan,Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3281,Stan,"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3287,Stan,"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3289,Stan,"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3292,Stan,"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving. "
1,7,Pinkeye,3294,Stan,"Oh, then, what's Halloween about? "
1,7,Pinkeye,3296,Stan,Oh. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3300,Stan,Yeah. 
1,7,Pinkeye,3302,Stan,"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3310,Stan,That was awesome! 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3328,Stan,"Hey, who's that fat chick? "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3330,Stan,Oh. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3332,Stan,Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3339,Stan,SWEET! 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3341,Stan,I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3344,Stan,Hello? Is this Sally Struthers? 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3346,Stan,Oh. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3348,Stan,"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3350,Stan,Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3352,Stan,Just a second fat-ass! 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3354,Stan,"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- [To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens? "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3356,Stan,Oh. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3358,Stan,Do we get the sports watch right away? 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3360,Stan,She says we do. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3373,Stan,"You mean, like Kenny? "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3426,Stan,Damn. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3440,Stan,"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3442,Stan,"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3446,Stan,"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds? "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3450,Stan,I think he said his name is Marvin. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3460,Stan,"Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3463,Stan,It was my mom's credit card. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3481,Stan,This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.' 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3493,Stan,"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3505,Stan,"Yeah, yeah, we do! "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3512,Stan,He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3519,Stan,He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3532,Stan,No. 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3536,Stan,So why can't he live here now? 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3545,Stan,"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3640,Stan,"Hey, where's Cartman? "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3659,Stan,"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3734,Stan,"Oh my god, they've killed Kenny! "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3738,Stan,We did it!! 
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3754,Stan,"Wow, it sucks he has to leave. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3756,Stan,"You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people. "
1,8,Starvin' Marvin,3758,Stan,"But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3781,Stan,"Lights, please. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3783,Stan," And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of ...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord. Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'  And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3816,Stan,"Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle? "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3822,Stan,Christmas Poo? 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3834,Stan,"Whoa, Christmas snow! "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3841,Stan,"That was sick, dude! "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3847,Stan,"...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3855,Stan,Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3859,Stan,"We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3862,Stan,"Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude? "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3868,Stan,"See you around, dude. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3881,Stan,The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",3907,Stan,Yeah. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4000,Stan,You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas! 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4002,Stan,'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4004,Stan,What's that? 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4008,Stan,"What's in the box, dude? "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4014,Stan,"[angrily] Dude, sick!!! "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4020,Stan,"Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4114,Stan,"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4150,Stan,I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4179,Stan,"This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4183,Stan,We committed him. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4187,Stan,Huh?! O-oh. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4191,Stan,"This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey! "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4195,Stan,I believe. 
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4216,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4240,Stan,"You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too. "
1,9,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo",4245,Stan,Wh-what could it be? 
1,10,Damien,4258,Stan,"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year? "
1,10,Damien,4262,Stan,"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too. "
1,10,Damien,4298,Stan,"Whoa, dude! "
1,10,Damien,4308,Stan,"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'? "
1,10,Damien,4311,Stan,Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday. 
1,10,Damien,4314,Stan,Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
1,10,Damien,4317,Stan,"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. "
1,10,Damien,4320,Stan,"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid? "
1,10,Damien,4332,Stan,Hey new kid! 
1,10,Damien,4334,Stan,"Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog. "
1,10,Damien,4340,Stan,What the... ? 
1,10,Damien,4342,Stan,A what? 
1,10,Damien,4347,Stan,"Hey, Chef. "
1,10,Damien,4364,Stan,Whoa! 
1,10,Damien,4377,Stan,"Jesus, Jesus! "
1,10,Damien,4379,Stan,"No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil. "
1,10,Damien,4383,Stan,"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you. "
1,10,Damien,4385,Stan,Yeah. 
1,10,Damien,4388,Stan,[To Kyle.] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid. 
1,10,Damien,4428,Stan,You're gonna fight Satan? 
1,10,Damien,4442,Stan,"[To Kyle.] I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday? "
1,10,Damien,4446,Stan,"Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in. "
1,10,Damien,4451,Stan,Did the Devil show up yet? 
1,10,Damien,4468,Stan,"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge. "
1,10,Damien,4508,Stan,"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'. "
1,10,Damien,4514,Stan,"Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart. "
1,10,Damien,4516,Stan,"Bubye, Fart-boy. "
1,10,Damien,4545,Stan,"Hey, Jesus. "
1,10,Damien,4549,Stan,"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God. "
1,10,Damien,4560,Stan,"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs. "
1,10,Damien,4563,Stan,"But you're his sparring partner, Chef. "
1,10,Damien,4579,Stan,"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili. "
1,10,Damien,4599,Stan,"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid. "
1,10,Damien,4613,Stan,"Whoa, that was cool! "
1,10,Damien,4637,Stan,"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out! "
1,10,Damien,4641,Stan,"[swings his left arm] Aaanh, he does this all the time. "
1,10,Damien,4653,Stan,"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [The round ends.] You've got to fight, Jesus. "
1,10,Damien,4657,Stan,"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him.] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One! "
1,10,Damien,4659,Stan,Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best! 
1,10,Damien,4661,Stan,She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold! 
1,10,Damien,4663,Stan,[Turning to Kyle.] What? 
1,10,Damien,4665,Stan,[Thinks a moment.] ... Really? 
1,10,Damien,4667,Stan,"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks. "
1,10,Damien,4669,Stan,"You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'. "
1,10,Damien,4671,Stan,"You did, Jesus. "
1,10,Damien,4676,Stan,"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek. "
1,10,Damien,4705,Stan,[Over the microphone.] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan. 
1,10,Damien,4714,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. "
1,10,Damien,4718,Stan,You're leaving already? 
1,10,Damien,4721,Stan,Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid. 
1,10,Damien,4723,Stan,Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4729,Stan,I know. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4732,Stan,"I can't afford a cruise, dude. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4735,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! "

1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4946,Stan,I bet I scored 100! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4948,Stan,"Oh, hi, Wendy. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4952,Stan,That's impossible! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4967,Stan,What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4973,Stan,A whatbian? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4976,Stan,Kenny? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4978,Stan,"No, explain it to us, Chef. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4980,Stan,Oh. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4984,Stan,"Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too! "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4987,Stan,"You're just saying that, Cartman. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,4999,Stan,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5002,Stan,Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5026,Stan,I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5028,Stan,"No, you're a fatter lesbian than me. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5037,Stan,"Wow. Hi, Wendy. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5044,Stan,Wow! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5056,Stan,"Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5080,Stan,Bluuch. Kick ass! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5096,Stan,Are we making love now? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5098,Stan,"[""They don't have a fireplace here we shouldn't be making love yet. ""]"
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5100,Stan,"You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5102,Stan,But why? 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5104,Stan,"It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it? "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5122,Stan,I think so. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5124,Stan,Yup. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5126,Stan,Yup. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5128,Stan,Did I what?

1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5183,Stan,Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive. 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5185,Stan,"Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff. "
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5188,Stan,Bluuuuch! 
1,11,Tom's Rhinoplasty,5192,Stan,Sorry.

1,12,Mecha-Streisand,5673,Stan,"Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me. "

2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7649,Stan,"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7699,Stan,"What are you goin' to do, dude? "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7773,Stan,"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7777,Stan,"Dude, what did you make that doll out of? "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7791,Stan,"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7847,Stan,"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7855,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7942,Stan,"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,7993,Stan,"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea! "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8009,Stan,"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8011,Stan,Yeah. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8013,Stan,[Follows.] Naturally. 
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8021,Stan,"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine. "
2,4,Ike's Wee Wee,8024,Stan,"[Mimicking.] Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay? "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8036,Stan,Yeah. 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8042,Stan,"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8044,Stan,"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8053,Stan,"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8055,Stan,We're losing men fast out here! 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8085,Stan,"[Somberly.] No, Cartman. Nobody ever has. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8112,Stan,Wa-was it wearing clothes? 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8114,Stan,"Oh, yeah. Eeww. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8128,Stan,AGGGGGGHHHHHH!

2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8148,Stan,ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH! 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8159,Stan,"[To Cartman.] Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again? "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8163,Stan,"Aw, do we have to? "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8169,Stan,Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals? 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8213,Stan,"Whoa, dude, this is a school? "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8324,Stan,"[To Kyle.] Okay, what have you got? "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8328,Stan,Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect! 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8330,Stan,Places! 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8339,Stan,"Chef, we're hungry. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8379,Stan,"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese! "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8385,Stan,"Dude, Chef has lost it. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8391,Stan,"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8395,Stan,Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball! 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8401,Stan,You don't? 
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8413,Stan,"Damn, dude. China's fucked up. "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8436,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8490,Stan,"Yeah, shut up, Pip. [To Chef.] Can we go home now? "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8501,Stan,"Dude, it's the freak nurse! "
2,5,Conjoined Fetus Lady,8521,Stan,"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8570,Stan,"Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8591,Stan,No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there. 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8596,Stan,Whoa! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8635,Stan,Wow! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8672,Stan,"""...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp."" "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8674,Stan,"""Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster."" "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8676,Stan,"""...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride."" "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8678,Stan,"""So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8685,Stan,From Vietnam veterans. 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8687,Stan,"No, no, we didn't-- "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8690,Stan,"Bu-but we're not making it up, it was-- "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8699,Stan,"For what, dude? "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8705,Stan,Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth? 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8710,Stan,How? 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8712,Stan,"Well, what do you mean? "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8729,Stan,"Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8732,Stan,Yeah. 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8773,Stan,"Ready, you guys? "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8776,Stan,Okay. Action! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8779,Stan,Cut! Cartman! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8781,Stan,It's supposed to be a frog! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8783,Stan,"Since when do frogs talk, Cartman? "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8788,Stan,"Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman? "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8790,Stan,Action! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8796,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8798,Stan,"Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8800,Stan,"It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready? "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8802,Stan,Good. A-and action! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8852,Stan,"They deserve it for lying to us, dude. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8854,Stan,They're here! Hurry and hide! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8897,Stan,"Holy crap, dude. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8904,Stan,"Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8908,Stan,"Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8911,Stan,We shot all those videos and sent them in. 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8917,Stan,"Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8932,Stan,"[""It was just a joke we didn't think it would hurt anybody. ""]"
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8941,Stan,"Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8954,Stan,"Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8957,Stan,You big piece of crap! 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8987,Stan,"Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,8999,Stan,"W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9002,Stan,Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself. 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9008,Stan,"Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9010,Stan,"No, your producer did. "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9012,Stan,She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs. 
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9014,Stan,"During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie! "
2,6,The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka,9026,Stan,"W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9047,Stan,"Hey, Cartman! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9049,Stan,Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9053,Stan,"Give us some, Cartman! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9056,Stan,"Dude, the road is always snowy. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9059,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9063,Stan,"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9070,Stan,"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9098,Stan,Where are we? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9100,Stan,I don't think we're in a very safe spot. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9116,Stan,"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9146,Stan,Dude! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9149,Stan,Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9151,Stan,"Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9156,Stan,I think we have to signal them somehow. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9162,Stan,"Come on Cartman, fart! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9164,Stan,[To Kyle and Wendy] He can't hold it in forever. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9171,Stan,"Hey, it's happening again. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9173,Stan,"It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman? "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9175,Stan,"Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9178,Stan,Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9182,Stan,"Now, that was what I call a sticky situation. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9214,Stan,Do you see 'er dude? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9221,Stan,"No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9225,Stan,Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9233,Stan,"Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9270,Stan,What time is it? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9273,Stan,"Dude, I think it's Saturday now. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9277,Stan,"Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9279,Stan,"I don't know, it's- a big scary monster. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9282,Stan,What? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9298,Stan,"Hey, look! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9306,Stan,"Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9319,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, stop! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9335,Stan,"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9367,Stan,What was that? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9369,Stan,"Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9386,Stan,Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9391,Stan,"Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9400,Stan,"Oh my God, it's killing Kenny! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9403,Stan,"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9424,Stan,Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9426,Stan,What? 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9433,Stan,"We believe in you, Fonz. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9440,Stan,Oh my God! They've killed Kenny! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9443,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9447,Stan,Oh no! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9453,Stan,Now we need more weight in the back. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9455,Stan,"No, that's too much! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9458,Stan,"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9466,Stan,Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9495,Stan,Hey yeah! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9513,Stan,"Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us? "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9516,Stan,"Boy, do I! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9532,Stan,"Cartman, no! "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9535,Stan,The bus is going over! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9541,Stan,[He and Kyle get up and look out the window] Hey! We've landed in ice cream! 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9557,Stan,GAAA-uh. 
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9559,Stan,"Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9562,Stan,"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9564,Stan,"Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9566,Stan,"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems. "
2,7,City on the Edge of Forever (Flashbacks),9568,Stan,Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9609,Stan,"Shut up, Pip. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9616,Stan,"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9618,Stan,"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9621,Stan,"Jesus, Cartman! "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9628,Stan,The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9634,Stan,"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9636,Stan,Heard what? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9643,Stan,How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9646,Stan,"Oh gosh, killed Kenny! "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9649,Stan,"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9665,Stan,"Man, it's hot out here. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9668,Stan,I know! Let's go sledding! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9671,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, get on. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9674,Stan,"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman? "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9679,Stan,What the hell is going on? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9682,Stan,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9686,Stan,"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9720,Stan,Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9723,Stan,"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9726,Stan,That's good. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9732,Stan,Right. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9736,Stan,"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9738,Stan,Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9741,Stan,"Whatever, dude. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9745,Stan,"But Cartman, we're trying to-- "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9747,Stan,"What does he mean, ""living in denial""? "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9750,Stan,"There, how does that look? "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9752,Stan,"Uh, crap..! "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9777,Stan,He's taking swimming lessons. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9844,Stan,"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman? "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9891,Stan,"Yeah, they need to shut it off. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9905,Stan,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9917,Stan,"Man, this sucks. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,9919,Stan,We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,9925,Stan,"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,10012,Stan,How many days left in summer? 
2,8,Summer Sucks,10014,Stan,Dammit! I just want it to snow again! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,10018,Stan,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,10021,Stan,There's nothin' to do. 
2,8,Summer Sucks,10032,Stan,"Hey, look! We blew up the snake! "
2,8,Summer Sucks,10056,Stan,Winter's back! 
2,8,Summer Sucks,10062,Stan,"Well, I can hardly wait. "
2,8,Summer Sucks,10066,Stan,"Hey, Chef! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10087,Stan,"Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10103,Stan,"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10110,Stan,She's not my girlfriend. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10114,Stan,"Damn, dude. Look at all these people. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10120,Stan,Whatcha doin'? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10123,Stan,"Calm down, tubby. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10142,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! [To Wendy.] Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. [They walk away.] "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10148,Stan,When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10150,Stan,They what?! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10157,Stan,"[With soda and popcorn.] Oh, brother. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10165,Stan,Dude! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10167,Stan,Dude! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10195,Stan,"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10197,Stan,"Yeah, pretty much. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10199,Stan,"The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10203,Stan,"Yeah, but that'd be like IMAX. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10224,Stan,Are they good? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10226,Stan,"Hey, dude, these are good! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10232,Stan,There is what again? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10237,Stan,"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10239,Stan,"To the sewer, dude. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10249,Stan,What was that? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10259,Stan,Mr. Garrison? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10288,Stan,What do you mean? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10294,Stan,"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10330,Stan,"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10369,Stan,"Jeez, they made that into a movie already? "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10398,Stan,"[Happening upon the scene.] Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10400,Stan,"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10405,Stan,So what do we do now? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10409,Stan,Why? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10451,Stan,"[Concerned.] Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10453,Stan,Okay! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10464,Stan,Sorry. 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10468,Stan,"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this! "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10470,Stan,Blaach! 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10473,Stan,"No problem, dude. "
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10532,Stan,What the hell is he doing? 
2,9,Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls,10563,Stan,"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10579,Stan,"Dude, you've got herpes on your face! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10586,Stan,Ow! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10607,Stan,"Yeah, it's pretty weird. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10615,Stan,We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10619,Stan,Catch what? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10624,Stan,Sshh! Cartman! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10631,Stan,"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10667,Stan,Huh? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10677,Stan,"Dude, I think I just saw a rat! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10681,Stan,I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10683,Stan,Oh. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10690,Stan,"[Mad.] Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10692,Stan,"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10694,Stan,"Well, you sure seem happy about it! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10745,Stan,Okay. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10747,Stan,Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10750,Stan,I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10752,Stan,"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. [Click.] "
2,10,Chickenpox,10762,Stan,"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day-- "
2,10,Chickenpox,10764,Stan,Ey! Get me out of here! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10851,Stan,Homework?! But I'm in the hospital! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10853,Stan,That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10855,Stan,"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo. "
2,10,Chickenpox,10858,Stan,Wait! Where are you going? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10860,Stan,Milkshakes?! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10863,Stan,Weak! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10896,Stan,And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10898,Stan,[Pointing to Shelly.] Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10900,Stan,Yeah. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10902,Stan,What are you talking about? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10904,Stan,They did? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10906,Stan,Why? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10908,Stan,[Long gasp.] Of course! 
2,10,Chickenpox,10917,Stan,"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny! "
2,10,Chickenpox,10920,Stan,It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something. 
2,10,Chickenpox,10995,Stan,How does someone get herpes? 
2,10,Chickenpox,10999,Stan,But what if we want to give somebody herpes? 
2,10,Chickenpox,11019,Stan,My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. [Coughs.] 
2,10,Chickenpox,11021,Stan,"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do. "
2,10,Chickenpox,11023,Stan,"Thanks a lot, Frida! "
2,10,Chickenpox,11031,Stan,[Hiding behind Kyle.] I don't wanna go back there. 
2,10,Chickenpox,11034,Stan,Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first? 
2,10,Chickenpox,11036,Stan,"You know, freshen up your breath. "
2,10,Chickenpox,11050,Stan,Pretty good. 
2,10,Chickenpox,11053,Stan,"Wow, coo-hul! "
2,10,Chickenpox,11061,Stan,We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff. 
2,10,Chickenpox,11078,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11088,Stan,Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11090,Stan,"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11099,Stan,It's boring. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11150,Stan,"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school? "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11157,Stan,This is stupid. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11188,Stan,"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11191,Stan,I don't know. I don't even remember what happened. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11201,Stan,"Yeah, mine too. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11210,Stan,"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11217,Stan,"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11251,Stan,That's a haiku? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11253,Stan,Oh. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11255,Stan,No. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11260,Stan,Yeah. What's a discharge? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11262,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11264,Stan,"[Stumped, then to Kyle.] Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon? "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11271,Stan,"Where have you been, Cartman? "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11283,Stan,Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11324,Stan,"Dude, what just happened? "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11326,Stan,"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11342,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is- "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11361,Stan,"Dude, this isn't right. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11363,Stan,"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11365,Stan,"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11368,Stan,"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11371,Stan,He hits this switch- 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11375,Stan,"Yeah, I guess so. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11379,Stan,I don't know. 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11383,Stan,"This says ""maximum."" "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11385,Stan,"Oh my God, we've killed Kenny! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11388,Stan,"Dude, I told you something was up with this place! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11442,Stan,"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11446,Stan,"Yeah, pretty sure. "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11448,Stan,What other crime in South Park? 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11495,Stan,"Oh, no! They got Chef, too! "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11527,Stan,"Why are you doing this, dude? "
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11538,Stan,Mr. Mackey! 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11567,Stan,Get over here and untie us! 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11575,Stan,Oh my God! Dr. Adams! 
2,11,Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods,11578,Stan,Yeah. With nobody around to say anything. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11586,Stan,Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11588,Stan,Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11590,Stan,American base is only a few feet away. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11595,Stan,"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11598,Stan,"No, you don't! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11601,Stan,"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11608,Stan,Huh-I dunno. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11611,Stan,"Hi, Wendy. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11620,Stan,No. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11622,Stan,We could? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11624,Stan,"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11626,Stan,Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11632,Stan,[Intrigued.] Truth or Dare? Wow. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11634,Stan,"Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11636,Stan,We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11665,Stan,"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11667,Stan,How do we do it? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11669,Stan,"Yeah, dude! How'd you know? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11677,Stan,Dude! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11688,Stan,Sweet! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11708,Stan,This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11710,Stan,"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11712,Stan,"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11714,Stan,"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11718,Stan,We're building a clubhouse. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11723,Stan,"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11727,Stan,Fine! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11734,Stan,Fine! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11756,Stan,Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're-- 
2,12,Clubhouses,11759,Stan,'Kay. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11767,Stan,But Mr. Twig sucks. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11771,Stan,"Better than yours, fat boy. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11775,Stan,Almost. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11777,Stan,"Yes, Mr. Garrison. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11779,Stan," Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11785,Stan,Phew. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11796,Stan,"No, I just-- "
2,12,Clubhouses,11798,Stan,I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the-- 
2,12,Clubhouses,11800,Stan,But I didn't write the note! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11802,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11804,Stan,"Oh, man. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11806,Stan," Dear Kyle. You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.  I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.   "
2,12,Clubhouses,11808,Stan,"Whoa, dude! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11811,Stan,What's 'skylarkings'? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11813,Stan,Who? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11816,Stan,"Oh, no. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11823,Stan,"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11839,Stan,Excuse me. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11843,Stan,Hello? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11867,Stan,I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11869,Stan," I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11872,Stan,My mom won't let us. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11875,Stan,Pretty good. We're almost done. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11877,Stan,We're going as fast as we can! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11882,Stan,"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11884,Stan,No. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11886,Stan,I didn't even think about that. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11889,Stan,"And I say, ""Dare!"" "
2,12,Clubhouses,11891,Stan,"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11893,Stan,Oooh. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11895,Stan,Yeah. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11897,Stan,"""Dare!"" "
2,12,Clubhouses,11900,Stan,Oooh. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11902,Stan,You really think so? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11904,Stan,Wow! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11927,Stan,Hello? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11929,Stan,We're working on it. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11931,Stan,"No, you don't! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11933,Stan,Dude! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11935,Stan,"Aw, that hunk of fat-- [Sharon walks in.] Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11937,Stan,What?! Why? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11939,Stan,"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11941,Stan,"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that! "
2,12,Clubhouses,11944,Stan,What?! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11948,Stan,This is happening way too fast. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11966,Stan,Okay. We're done. 
2,12,Clubhouses,11969,Stan,"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. "
2,12,Clubhouses,11973,Stan,G'oh? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11975,Stan,Go where? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11977,Stan,But no! I have to get the girls to come- 
2,12,Clubhouses,11980,Stan,Weak! 
2,12,Clubhouses,11982,Stan,Dad? 
2,12,Clubhouses,11986,Stan,But I don't understand why we have to-- 
2,12,Clubhouses,11993,Stan,"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too? "
2,12,Clubhouses,11995,Stan,['But you and Mom are family how come you can just split up? ']
2,12,Clubhouses,11997,Stan,"You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12001,Stan,What? That's it? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12005,Stan,"I guess, but-- "
2,12,Clubhouses,12007,Stan,"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12009,Stan,"No way, dude! Don't be silly. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12011,Stan,"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right? "
2,12,Clubhouses,12013,Stan,"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12015,Stan,"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12018,Stan,"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up? "
2,12,Clubhouses,12020,Stan,"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12023,Stan,"[To Kyle, softly.] Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12031,Stan,Dude! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12041,Stan,"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12043,Stan,"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us? "
2,12,Clubhouses,12056,Stan,[Sensually.] Dare. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12059,Stan,"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years! "
2,12,Clubhouses,12062,Stan,Crap! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12096,Stan,Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12098,Stan,What? 
2,12,Clubhouses,12100,Stan,My dad lets me watch cartoons. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12104,Stan,Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse! 
2,12,Clubhouses,12106,Stan,"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me! "
2,12,Clubhouses,12108,Stan,Oh. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12111,Stan,Divorce is stupid. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12121,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy. "
2,12,Clubhouses,12182,Stan,Wow. Clubhouses are magical. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12186,Stan,Dare. 
2,12,Clubhouses,12189,Stan,...What?! 
2,13,Cow Days,12241,Stan,Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy. 
2,13,Cow Days,12244,Stan,Really? 
2,13,Cow Days,12305,Stan,What's that? 
2,13,Cow Days,12325,Stan,What the hell was that? 
2,13,Cow Days,12330,Stan,Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?! 
2,13,Cow Days,12340,Stan,"Yeah, this line is way too long! "
2,13,Cow Days,12343,Stan,Here we go. 
2,13,Cow Days,12347,Stan,What ride? 
2,13,Cow Days,12354,Stan,My ass we will! 
2,13,Cow Days,12356,Stan,"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again. "
2,13,Cow Days,12369,Stan,We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again. 
2,13,Cow Days,12386,Stan,Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls? 
2,13,Cow Days,12419,Stan,"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby. "
2,13,Cow Days,12421,Stan,"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say? "
2,13,Cow Days,12434,Stan,This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win. 
2,13,Cow Days,12443,Stan,[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls. 
2,13,Cow Days,12450,Stan,"Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman. "
2,13,Cow Days,12454,Stan,We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
2,13,Cow Days,12461,Stan,How long was that? 
2,13,Cow Days,12463,Stan,Damn it! 
2,13,Cow Days,12465,Stan,"That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that. "
2,13,Cow Days,12487,Stan,What are you going to do? 
2,13,Cow Days,12489,Stan,"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. "
2,13,Cow Days,12493,Stan,"Hold on, Cartman! "
2,13,Cow Days,12500,Stan,"Come on, Cartman. "
2,13,Cow Days,12509,Stan,"You okay, dude? "
2,13,Cow Days,12511,Stan,"Cartman, hello? Hel-lo? "
2,13,Cow Days,12515,Stan,What's the matter with him. 
2,13,Cow Days,12518,Stan,But can he still ride a bull? 
2,13,Cow Days,12525,Stan,"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me? "
2,13,Cow Days,12527,Stan,What?! 
2,13,Cow Days,12529,Stan,"Oh, he's fine, dude. "
2,13,Cow Days,12532,Stan,"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo. "
2,13,Cow Days,12545,Stan,How's he doing? 
2,13,Cow Days,12548,Stan,Do you think he can ride the bull? 
2,13,Cow Days,12550,Stan,Cool. 
2,13,Cow Days,12561,Stan,"Jesus, dude! "
2,13,Cow Days,12563,Stan,"Oh, hell! "
2,13,Cow Days,12565,Stan,"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride. "
2,13,Cow Days,12584,Stan,"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?! "
2,13,Cow Days,12589,Stan,[Points to him.] There he is! 
2,13,Cow Days,12610,Stan,"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours! "
2,13,Cow Days,12623,Stan,"Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this. "
2,13,Cow Days,12625,Stan,I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull. 
2,13,Cow Days,12644,Stan,"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him. "
2,13,Cow Days,12649,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! "
2,13,Cow Days,12657,Stan,"We did it, dude, we did it! "
2,13,Cow Days,12680,Stan,Yeah. And we have $5000 this time. 
2,13,Cow Days,12685,Stan,"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? "
2,13,Cow Days,12691,Stan,We should- 
2,13,Cow Days,12694,Stan,"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! "
2,13,Cow Days,12737,Stan,"[With a Terrance doll.] Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh. "
2,13,Cow Days,12740,Stan,"Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling? "
2,13,Cow Days,12746,Stan,Oh-h. Nowhere. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12768,Stan,But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12784,Stan,"What, dude? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12843,Stan,That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12881,Stan,"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12886,Stan,"Hello there, Chef. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12890,Stan,"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12896,Stan,You do? 
2,14,Chef Aid,12929,Stan,"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12939,Stan,"We've gotta help him, dude. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12941,Stan,Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit! 
2,14,Chef Aid,12945,Stan,"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass. "
2,14,Chef Aid,12962,Stan,Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really-- 
2,14,Chef Aid,12965,Stan,"Wow, you remember him? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12981,Stan,So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out? 
2,14,Chef Aid,12984,Stan,"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy? "
2,14,Chef Aid,12986,Stan,[Unsure.] 'Kay. 
2,14,Chef Aid,12988,Stan,"Thanks, dude. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13005,Stan,"Hello, are you Meat Loaf? "
2,14,Chef Aid,13011,Stan,"Our friend, Chef. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13024,Stan,Wow! So you'll help him? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13042,Stan,"Yeah, thanks. [To Kyle as they walk away.] That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13064,Stan,Wait! Wait! What are you doing? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13066,Stan,"No, you don't! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13077,Stan,You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--! 
2,14,Chef Aid,13089,Stan,No more Chef. 
2,14,Chef Aid,13091,Stan,"We can't let him down, you guys. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13092,Stan,"Dude, it's over. He's gone. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13093,Stan,No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13096,Stan,"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13098,Stan,"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13124,Stan,"[To Kyle.] Cartman just needs to put more into it. [To Cartman] Dance better, Cartman! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13128,Stan,Elton John! What are you doing here? 
2,14,Chef Aid,13130,Stan,"Boy, do we! "
2,14,Chef Aid,13135,Stan,"Yeah, dude, it's all yours. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13196,Stan,"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef? "
2,14,Chef Aid,13199,Stan,"We’re gonna raise your money, Chef. "
2,14,Chef Aid,13216,Stan,"Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13277,Stan,I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13282,Stan,"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13286,Stan,What? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13291,Stan,"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13294,Stan,"Dude, this is creepy. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13303,Stan,"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13308,Stan,Wow! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13315,Stan,I don't know. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13321,Stan,I don't like it. It's spooky. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13323,Stan,Do I have to? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13325,Stan,Damn it! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13330,Stan,"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13332,Stan,Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13334,Stan,"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13336,Stan,"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13341,Stan,"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13344,Stan,"Why do you keep saying ""hella"", fatass?! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13350,Stan,"Can you leave the light on, Dad? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13352,Stan,I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13355,Stan,"Where did it go? [he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.] Huhhh. [he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13366,Stan,"Hey. Where did the shirt go? [hops off and approaches the fish] I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! [the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan's eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.] AAAaAaAaAa [runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish] I'm not gonna look. [shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it's on, are closer to the bed] It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. [shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed] GAAAH! [shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet] AAAAAAAH!! [he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway] MOM! Mom! [comes back to the room with her in tow] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13368,Stan,"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13372,Stan,No! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13376,Stan,AAAAAAAAH! [runs back to bed] 
2,15,Spookyfish,13378,Stan,[pointing] The fish! [nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall] But- 
2,15,Spookyfish,13381,Stan,[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed] WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13383,Stan,"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew- "
2,15,Spookyfish,13385,Stan,"[turns to the fish] You're not gonna get away with this! [the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: ""Yes I Will.""] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13390,Stan,"[sees Sharon pass by] Mom, what are you doing? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13392,Stan,"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13395,Stan,But MOM! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13398,Stan,MMOOMM! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13400,Stan,"[points at the body, then holds up his hands] No, mom! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13410,Stan,[squeezes into Kyle's chair so both fit. Cartman walks to Kenny's chair] I haven't been sleeping so well. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13413,Stan,"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13415,Stan,"Do you think animals can be murderers, too? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13420,Stan,I haven't been sleeping well. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13422,Stan,My pet goldfish killed another random person last night. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13427,Stan,What are you doing?! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13464,Stan,"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13472,Stan,What? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13476,Stan,"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13485,Stan,"[taps Kyle, then softly] Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13487,Stan,Cartman! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13489,Stan,"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish? "
2,15,Spookyfish,13491,Stan,Do you remember what pet store? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13493,Stan,Where? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13495,Stan,"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13500,Stan,"Just help me take it back. Come on! [walks to Aunt Flo, who's now dead on the floor] Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13502,Stan,It was the fish! [points to it] 
2,15,Spookyfish,13504,Stan,Now we'll never know where that pet store is! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13506,Stan,Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. [Kenny starts to gargle as the fish gives him the blender treatment. The water turns blood red as Kenny spins in the tank] 
2,15,Spookyfish,13511,Stan,"[to Kyle] Come on, we're running out of time. [both walk by Randy trying to open a door] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13532,Stan,"Yeah, my goldfish-. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13535,Stan,I know. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13540,Stan,"Come on, let's go! [takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon] Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13544,Stan,I wanna return a fish. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13548,Stan,"Yeah, dude. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13552,Stan,So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13554,Stan,Why? 
2,15,Spookyfish,13556,Stan,"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13573,Stan,"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13575,Stan,"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13579,Stan,"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! [the clerk takes the fish from Stan] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13582,Stan,Yeah! 
2,15,Spookyfish,13593,Stan,I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13597,Stan,"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13603,Stan,"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care. "
2,15,Spookyfish,13623,Stan,"[the crowd cheers] We won, dude! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13627,Stan,"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! [the two groups face each other] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13634,Stan,Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13641,Stan,"[picks it up] Get to the stage! [Stan, Kyle, and Evil Cartman rush up. Stan's spooky fish attacks a man and kills him] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13644,Stan,"Up yours, evil twin! [zaps him back to the evil, parallel universe.] "
2,15,Spookyfish,13648,Stan,Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. [takes aim] 
2,15,Spookyfish,13653,Stan,"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe! "
2,15,Spookyfish,13661,Stan,Our Cartman would never say anything like that. 
2,15,Spookyfish,13664,Stan,"You tricked us, Cartman! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13675,Stan,"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13677,Stan,"[""But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's why can't I? ""]"
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13681,Stan,I don't want your lame-ass supper! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13684,Stan,"[retrieving a backpack from his closet] Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old! [goes to his window, opens it, and stands on the sill] I don't need this stupid family anyway! [drops to the ground outside and leaves] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13692,Stan,"[walking up] Okay, let's go! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13694,Stan,"'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13698,Stan,"So, how far is it to Nebraska? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13702,Stan,"Yeah. Or, we could not. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13716,Stan,This is Nebraska? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13721,Stan,"[now seated] Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13756,Stan,[pointing] He's the fat one. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13760,Stan,"Sick, dude. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13768,Stan,"[dissenting] Yeah, right! "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13770,Stan,"My family's dead! [Uncle Stinky, a baby, and Aunt Lisa gasp.] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13773,Stan,They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13788,Stan,"[to Cartman] Dude, is he here every year like this? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13801,Stan,"Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13805,Stan,"What, dude? [Cartman wakes up] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13807,Stan,"Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13809,Stan,What was that? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13812,Stan,I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. [Kyle walks behind Stan and punches Cartman] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13820,Stan,We thought you were in jail. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13836,Stan,"[snaps his fingers] Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13874,Stan,All families suck ass! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13888,Stan,Do you really think we should go with this guy? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13906,Stan,Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13918,Stan,I really like that guy. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13928,Stan,[after a pause] Mr. Hankey? [his elves lift the boys onto Hankey's lap] 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13932,Stan,You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13941,Stan,"Oh, boy. You've done it now. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13967,Stan,"Where did you go, Uncle Charlie? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13970,Stan,Hey. Where's Kenny? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,13973,Stan,"Oh, hey Kenny. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14001,Stan,There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14026,Stan,Oh ooh. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14033,Stan,[from inside the house] ...Sorry. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14051,Stan,"[walks to the window, looks out, sees his parents, then turns to Kyle] Dude, they're gonna kill me. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14056,Stan,[walking in] 'Scuse me. I wanna go with you. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14058,Stan,"Please, I don't wanna go back with them. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14060,Stan,I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place. 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14063,Stan,What?! 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14066,Stan,"But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14068,Stan,"[pondering] I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. [they hug] "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14101,Stan,"I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom. "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14103,Stan,Really? 
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14105,Stan,"Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What? "
2,16,Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!,14114,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. "
2,17,Gnomes,14117,Stan,That's okay with us. 
2,17,Gnomes,14127,Stan,"[laments] Oh, not Tweek. "
2,17,Gnomes,14131,Stan,"Dude, we can't work with this kid. "
2,17,Gnomes,14134,Stan,No. 
2,17,Gnomes,14162,Stan,"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so-- "
2,17,Gnomes,14164,Stan,"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. "
2,17,Gnomes,14170,Stan,"Great. A lot of help you are, kid. "
2,17,Gnomes,14172,Stan,What? 
2,17,Gnomes,14174,Stan,What gnomes? 
2,17,Gnomes,14179,Stan,"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes. "
2,17,Gnomes,14193,Stan,"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it. "
2,17,Gnomes,14199,Stan,'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow. 
2,17,Gnomes,14205,Stan,"[to Tweek] Wow, that sucks, dude. "
2,17,Gnomes,14208,Stan,Yeah. 
2,17,Gnomes,14218,Stan,Kind of bitter. 
2,17,Gnomes,14227,Stan,Aooooo! 
2,17,Gnomes,14230,Stan,"Yeess, this stuff rocks! "
2,17,Gnomes,14232,Stan,[running] Whoopee! 
2,17,Gnomes,14242,Stan,"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why. "
2,17,Gnomes,14245,Stan,"[cross] Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed! "
2,17,Gnomes,14247,Stan,Bad! 
2,17,Gnomes,14254,Stan,"[goes with Kyle to get it] No, we'll use it. "
2,17,Gnomes,14265,Stan,"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks! "
2,17,Gnomes,14273,Stan,Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine. 
2,17,Gnomes,14284,Stan,Huh?? 
2,17,Gnomes,14314,Stan,Our case? 
2,17,Gnomes,14339,Stan,Uh... Hooray. 
2,17,Gnomes,14365,Stan,Uh... 
2,17,Gnomes,14374,Stan,[rising from the bottom] I like small businesses. 
2,17,Gnomes,14417,Stan,"Your dad really screwed us, Tweek! "
2,17,Gnomes,14422,Stan,"'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original! "
2,17,Gnomes,14426,Stan,"[""Yum tum yummy tum day!""] Yeah, that makes sense. "
2,17,Gnomes,14429,Stan,How do we stretch that into five minutes? 
2,17,Gnomes,14433,Stan,"What the hell? [""We won't stop""] "
2,17,Gnomes,14437,Stan,"Hey there, little guy. "
2,17,Gnomes,14445,Stan,"Hey, he talks! "
2,17,Gnomes,14449,Stan,"Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants? "
2,17,Gnomes,14453,Stan,"Business? Wait, do you know anything about business? "
2,17,Gnomes,14463,Stan,"Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us? "
2,17,Gnomes,14473,Stan,"Damn, dude, this place is huge! "
2,17,Gnomes,14485,Stan,I don't get it. 
2,17,Gnomes,14488,Stan,"No you don't, fatass! "
2,17,Gnomes,14495,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. "
2,17,Gnomes,14498,Stan,Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed. 
2,17,Gnomes,14500,Stan,Do you know anything about corporate takeovers? 
2,17,Gnomes,14505,Stan,Underpants? 
2,17,Gnomes,14512,Stan,"Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations. "
2,17,Gnomes,14519,Stan,"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14545,Stan,Holy crap. dude! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14549,Stan,This guy rules! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14554,Stan,Yeah! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14564,Stan,Dude! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14566,Stan,"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14569,Stan,Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14572,Stan,"[to Cartman] Hey, he's still alive. [looks down and calls] Kyle, you okay? [Cartman returns and looks down] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14577,Stan,"Can you climb back up, dude? "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14579,Stan,"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14582,Stan,"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach! [his vomit goes everywhere] Bluchluchluchluch. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14584,Stan,"Sorry. [Cartman slips a bit] What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! [drops to the cave ground and stands up] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14587,Stan,All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14592,Stan,"He's like, some frozen guy. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14594,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! [to Kyle] Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14596,Stan,"[to Cartman and Kenny] You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14598,Stan,[to Kyle] Help me chip some of the ice away. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14602,Stan,"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward? "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14607,Stan,Where shall we bring it? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14609,Stan,I think I'm going to name it Gorak. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14611,Stan,"[stops] Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? [Cartman pulls, but isn't going anywhere] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14613,Stan,"You didn't find him, I found him. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14615,Stan,You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14627,Stan,"Huh, excuse me? "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14630,Stan,I found this frozen guy in the woods today. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14639,Stan,Really. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14642,Stan,Wait a minute! His name is Gorak! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14684,Stan,"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14686,Stan,"No, it isn't! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14688,Stan,"I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14692,Stan,"No, I'll go! I found him! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14701,Stan,"Oh my God, they revived Gorak. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14705,Stan,"Uh, hi. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14708,Stan,"He said, ""hi."" "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14712,Stan,He wants to know where he is. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14714,Stan,You're... home. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14719,Stan,"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14729,Stan,"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14733,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14736,Stan,Fine! [turns and walks away] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14760,Stan,He doesn't look very happy in there. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14762,Stan,"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14774,Stan,[approaches with Kyle and Cartman] You guys aren't being very nice to my creature. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14777,Stan,"Let him out, dude. He's scared. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14784,Stan,"[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! [looks at Kyle] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14787,Stan,"[a voice in the night] Gorak! [he rushes to the habitat, then heads to the access door] Gorak! Gorak! Are you there? "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14789,Stan,"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14792,Stan,What are you doing here? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14794,Stan,What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14796,Stan,His name is Gorak! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14799,Stan,Gorak! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14801,Stan,What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14803,Stan,"[looks up at Larry, who looks back] No he doesn't!! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14806,Stan,"I found him, I'm rescuing him! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14809,Stan,You're a dick! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14811,Stan,"You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14813,Stan,"Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14815,Stan,"[hushed] Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14817,Stan,"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean. [turns his head aside] Wait. [walks off in the opposite direction] "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14865,Stan,"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14868,Stan,"You suck as a best friend, Cartman! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14870,Stan,"[walks to Larry, bathing in a tub out in the open with the garden hose, and looks at him for a while] What are you doing, Gorak! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14872,Stan,"Wow, that sucks, dude. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14875,Stan,"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14877,Stan,"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14884,Stan,"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14888,Stan,Come on! [the three run away] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14897,Stan,"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14900,Stan,"My friend, Gorak! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14902,Stan,"No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14906,Stan,"Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14911,Stan,'K. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14913,Stan,O-okay. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14915,Stan,'K [puts up his fists] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14931,Stan,[punched by Kyle] Ow! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14933,Stan,"Watch my coat, dude. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14936,Stan,Huh? [both look at Larry] 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14947,Stan,"[panting] No problem, Gorak. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14950,Stan,Yup. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14953,Stan,[panting] Right on. 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14959,Stan,His... name... is... Gorak! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14970,Stan,They're after you! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,14998,Stan,[catching up] Where's Gorak?? 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15004,Stan,"[turns around] Wait, look! The helicopter! "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15007,Stan,He's alive! 
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15015,Stan,"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy. "
2,18,Prehistoric Ice Man,15018,Stan,[walks off with Kyle] Could we be best friends again? [Cartman stops] I hate having Cartman as a best friend. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15042,Stan,Choirs suck. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15060,Stan,It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15064,Stan,What?! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15068,Stan,But we don't even care about the rainforest. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15077,Stan,"[As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15079,Stan,Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15146,Stan,"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15148,Stan,Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. [Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15153,Stan,[sees a branch] Aaah! Snake! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15155,Stan,Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15157,Stan,Oh. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15175,Stan,AAAAAAA! [hides behind a girl] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15177,Stan,SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15179,Stan,AAAAAAA! [runs farther back] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15182,Stan,[lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15187,Stan,Dude! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15212,Stan,"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15239,Stan,"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15245,Stan,This doesn't look very safe. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15294,Stan,Hey. Maybe Cartman was right. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15316,Stan,"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? [a column of smoke is seen floating above the canopy] "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15323,Stan,Holy crap! [all run] 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15325,Stan,Jesus Christ! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15329,Stan,We're sinking. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15332,Stan,"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""! "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15340,Stan,"Oh, now she figures it out. "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15344,Stan,Wow! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15363,Stan,Oh my God! They killed Kenny! 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15366,Stan,They did. 
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15368,Stan,"[pause] You know, ""they."" "
3,1,Rainforest Shmainforest,15372,Stan,Help ...him? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15383,Stan,"[with an air pump] Is this what you're looking for, Kyle? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15392,Stan,Why is that funny? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15394,Stan,That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15403,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15406,Stan,He just... ignited. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15431,Stan,"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15443,Stan,"Wow, that was short. [Priest Maxi stops them as they leave the pew] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15449,Stan,The what? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15456,Stan,"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15467,Stan,"Dad, where's our Bible? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15469,Stan,Or else what? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15471,Stan,...What? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15473,Stan,[after a long pause] Where's our Bible? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15477,Stan,"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15479,Stan,"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. [the boys go up the stairs and exit] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15482,Stan,"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15497,Stan,"Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15509,Stan,Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15514,Stan,Station Two: Jesus takes his cross. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15516,Stan,"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. [this is not part of the Stations] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15534,Stan,Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. [Kyle has tied Cartman to it] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15536,Stan,"[produces a crown of thorns] Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks."" "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15538,Stan,"And then Jesus was lead away [Kyle leads Cartman out] to Mount Sinai, where he dies, and has a resurrection three days later. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15547,Stan,"This spot looks good. [they drop the foot of the cross into the spot and lift the rest of the cross upright, then leave] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15549,Stan,"Okay, cool. See you, Cartman. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15551,Stan,"Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15556,Stan,"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15569,Stan,"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15572,Stan,"Wow, he died. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15575,Stan,Cartman?? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15579,Stan,"Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15590,Stan,"Sick, dude! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15594,Stan,"Okay, okay, just go away! [Mr. Mackey leaves laughing, and the boys walk on] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15597,Stan,Uh. We've been taking care of him. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15600,Stan,Apples? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15602,Stan,Dude! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15605,Stan,I don't think I like this new law. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15612,Stan,Yeah. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15627,Stan,"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15643,Stan,"Dude, he's still not dead. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15647,Stan,That's not your mom calling! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15651,Stan,He is right. It has been getting really hot lately. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15653,Stan,"Hey, yeah! [they turn and walk away] "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15684,Stan,"Dad, where's the phone book? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15688,Stan,"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15691,Stan,Oh. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15693,Stan,"Uh, it... sucks ass. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15710,Stan,"Oh my God, what's going on? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15722,Stan,"Dude, that's my dad! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15730,Stan,"I know, huh? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15732,Stan,He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15745,Stan,"What are you doing, dad? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15747,Stan,"No, he's not. He can't even get an erection. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15749,Stan,"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15751,Stan,"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15753,Stan,"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, [performs a Vulcan greeting] he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15755,Stan,It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. [Randy returns to his work] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15757,Stan,Huh? 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15759,Stan,"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference? "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15762,Stan,Dad. Dad! [Randy slowly comes out of his daydream] 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15764,Stan,"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started! "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15785,Stan,[to Kyle] See? My dad is the coolest after all. 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15787,Stan,Cartman! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15790,Stan,"He's been up there for like, three weeks. "
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15792,Stan,That's amazing! 
3,2,Spontaneous Combustion,15796,Stan,"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body? "
3,3,The Succubus,15835,Stan,"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch. "
3,3,The Succubus,15839,Stan," [squints hard for a better look] Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? [Kyle blinks hard] "
3,3,The Succubus,15843,Stan,Why do you have to see an eye doctor? 
3,3,The Succubus,15852,Stan,Where's Chef? 
3,3,The Succubus,15858,Stan,Why did Chef quit? 
3,3,The Succubus,15860,Stan,[after a moment of silence] Could you just hand us some food please? 
3,3,The Succubus,15865,Stan,"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back. "
3,3,The Succubus,15871,Stan,"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today. "
3,3,The Succubus,15875,Stan,But why? Why would you quit? 
3,3,The Succubus,15877,Stan,So you made sweet love to her down by the fire. 
3,3,The Succubus,15879,Stan,Talked?! 
3,3,The Succubus,15883,Stan,"[ignoring that statement] That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?! "
3,3,The Succubus,15889,Stan,What the hell is going on?! 
3,3,The Succubus,15902,Stan,She's stealing Chef from us. 
3,3,The Succubus,15905,Stan,"Wait you guys. [pensive] Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? [the others think about it...] "
3,3,The Succubus,15907,Stan,"...Yeah, screw that bitch. "
3,3,The Succubus,15910,Stan,Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow. 
3,3,The Succubus,15932,Stan,We wanna talk to Chef. 
3,3,The Succubus,15935,Stan,And a chef hat. 
3,3,The Succubus,15938,Stan,Huh? 
3,3,The Succubus,15947,Stan,"Chef, you have to dump the bitch! "
3,3,The Succubus,15954,Stan,But we don't like her. 
3,3,The Succubus,15956,Stan,I don't know-uh. No reason I guess. 
3,3,The Succubus,15967,Stan,[pissed] Dude! He bailed on us! 
3,3,The Succubus,15969,Stan,Come on! We're going to his house! [they leave the bus stop] 
3,3,The Succubus,15974,Stan,[sarcastic] You forgot! 
3,3,The Succubus,15980,Stan,Oh no! No nononononono! 
3,3,The Succubus,15988,Stan,"Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time. "
3,3,The Succubus,15992,Stan,What's a succubus? 
3,3,The Succubus,15995,Stan,Yeah! 
3,3,The Succubus,15998,Stan,"Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison! "
3,3,The Succubus,16006,Stan,"Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. [a small station wagon pulls up, driven by Cartman's mom] "
3,3,The Succubus,16015,Stan,Who are you? 
3,3,The Succubus,16022,Stan,"Chef, we have to talk to you! "
3,3,The Succubus,16026,Stan,You're Chef's parents? 
3,3,The Succubus,16032,Stan,"No, that's okay. "
3,3,The Succubus,16041,Stan,He wanted money? 
3,3,The Succubus,16069,Stan,"Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here? "
3,3,The Succubus,16072,Stan,"[disappointed] Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! "
3,3,The Succubus,16074,Stan,"Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman. "
3,3,The Succubus,16076,Stan,"Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us. "
3,3,The Succubus,16082,Stan,"We know what you are, lady! "
3,3,The Succubus,16085,Stan,A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men! 
3,3,The Succubus,16089,Stan,I guess. 
3,3,The Succubus,16091,Stan,"Jesus dude! [the boys are trembling, and Kenny keeps that hood tight] "
3,3,The Succubus,16103,Stan,"Excuse me! [the boys stop at the register] We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. [the boys approach the head table] "
3,3,The Succubus,16106,Stan,Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him 
3,3,The Succubus,16110,Stan,"Chef, but- "
3,3,The Succubus,16115,Stan,No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us! 
3,3,The Succubus,16117,Stan,"Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them. "
3,3,The Succubus,16119,Stan,Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus. 
3,3,The Succubus,16122,Stan,What the hell does that mean? 
3,3,The Succubus,16125,Stan,Right. 
3,3,The Succubus,16127,Stan,Yeah? 
3,3,The Succubus,16129,Stan,Oh-hoho! 
3,3,The Succubus,16132,Stan,That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards. 
3,3,The Succubus,16136,Stan,"We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song. [turns to Cartman] You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? [taps him] "
3,3,The Succubus,16139,Stan,God-damnit! You can't fall asleep. 
3,3,The Succubus,16151,Stan,"There she is! [""Here Comes the Bride"" plays. Chef and Priest Maxi await her.] "
3,3,The Succubus,16152,Stan,[as Veronica walks by] Bitch. Bitch. 
3,3,The Succubus,16154,Stan,Bitch. 
3,3,The Succubus,16156,Stan,[to Cartman] All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front. 
3,3,The Succubus,16164,Stan,"[as ""A Morning After"" begins] Here it goes. "
3,3,The Succubus,16166,Stan,"Now, Cartman! [Kyle holds the needle in his left hand. The crowd gasps and Veronica is pissed] "
3,3,The Succubus,16186,Stan,Come on Cartman! 
3,3,The Succubus,16189,Stan,Oh my God! She killed Kenny! 
3,3,The Succubus,16197,Stan,"[walks up with Kyle to Chef] We're sorry Chef, we had to do it! "
3,3,The Succubus,16207,Stan,[cheerfully] We'd love them! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16225,Stan,Where are you going? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16229,Stan,So? You can poo in the wilderness. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16234,Stan,Not here! Go further away! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16240,Stan,"Sick, dude! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16247,Stan,"[thinking of poo] We don't wanna look at it, Cartman! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16253,Stan,I see it! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16261,Stan,[outside] I saw it this way! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16266,Stan,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16306,Stan,I think his name is Junjun. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16347,Stan,Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16349,Stan,Wow! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16353,Stan,"[put off] No, he's annoying. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16356,Stan,Why don't we just tell our parents? 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16359,Stan,[softly] Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16361,Stan,"[softly, curtly] Sh! Keep quiet, stupid! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16367,Stan,"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond? "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16423,Stan,God-damn! 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16429,Stan,"[to Kyle] Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around? "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16475,Stan,[to Kyle] Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing. 
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16480,Stan,"Dude, it's crowded in here. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16551,Stan,"Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah! "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16614,Stan,"Oh, he'll win. Don't worry. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16619,Stan,"[huffs] Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that. "
3,4,Jakovasaurs,16658,Stan,Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is. 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16670,Stan,"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies? "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16676,Stan,[quickly points] Tweek is! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16688,Stan,"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls. "

3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16763,Stan,Tweek? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16766,Stan,"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16770,Stan,"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"" "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16774,Stan,"Yeah, it was weak. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16778,Stan,Tomorrow? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16829,Stan,"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16861,Stan,"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. [the two groups meet] All right. Here we go. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16865,Stan,Well? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16869,Stan,Huh? 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16876,Stan,"[in disgust] Aw, dude, come on!! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16880,Stan,"[approaches the fighters] All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16884,Stan,"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16886,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16888,Stan,Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16904,Stan,Damn it! 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,16960,Stan,"Okay, the time has finally come. [the other kids close in] "

3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17001,Stan,Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. [trading punches] 
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17010,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17033,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17035,Stan,"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17037,Stan,"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling? "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17040,Stan,"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17044,Stan,"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. [the group turns towards the door] "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17046,Stan,"[the group turns back to the beds] Well, I mean, that's what was on the news. "
3,5,Tweek vs. Craig,17053,Stan,"Come on, Tweek! You got him! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17071,Stan,"Ohh, dude, get me out of here! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17073,Stan,"You would think that, you little ass-sucker. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17075,Stan,"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17078,Stan,What? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17081,Stan,"No you can't, you little ass-sucker! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17093,Stan,"Hoh, whatever! [rests his head on his left hand] "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17095,Stan,I called you an ass-sucker! 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17097,Stan,"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17100,Stan,Wwhat do you mean? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17102,Stan,Uh... I'm eight? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17104,Stan,Huh? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17108,Stan,I have to give him half my stuff? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17112,Stan,"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17114,Stan,"Uh, no! I hate that toy! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17116,Stan,Damnit! 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17175,Stan,Where's our desks? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17177,Stan,"[huffs] You see, Cartman? You see what this has done? "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17241,Stan,Bad. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17246,Stan,"Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits? "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17251,Stan,"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17260,Stan,"[enter with Kyle, Cartman, Kenny] 'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17264,Stan,We want Sexual Harassment Panda. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17268,Stan,"Well, where is he?! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17270,Stan,What the hell is wrong with these people?! 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17305,Stan,[enters] 'Scuse me. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17307,Stan,Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here. 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17312,Stan,...Coats? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17315,Stan,"Dude, what the hell is going in?! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17318,Stan,"Well, we don't take kindly to you! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17323,Stan,"Come on, we'd better hurry. [the boys make their way past the men and leave] "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17330,Stan,"[reads] ""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place. [they enter] "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17332,Stan,Whoa! Who are you? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17336,Stan,"...Thanks a lot, dude. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17340,Stan,Have you seen any panda bears? 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17347,Stan,Oh my God! They killed Kenny! 
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17350,Stan,"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick! "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17355,Stan,"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17361,Stan,"[to Peetie] Okay, you are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new message that people will find useful again. "
3,6,Sexual Harassment Panda,17371,Stan,"[faces the audience] No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17706,Stan,I don't want to go to this stupid party! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17708,Stan,"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17714,Stan,Awww! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17717,Stan,I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17721,Stan,"[soft but urgent, tugging at Randy's pants] Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins! "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17723,Stan,"[soft but urgent, tugging at Sharon's dress] No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school! "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17726,Stan,"Shut up, Pip. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17728,Stan,"Butters, is there any way out of here? "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17731,Stan,Oh my God. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17733,Stan,No. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17747,Stan,[looks back] Yes. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17755,Stan,"[incredulous] Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17759,Stan,"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone! "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17782,Stan,[looks back displeased] What? 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17784,Stan,[grudgingly] What do I have to do? 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17786,Stan,"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17804,Stan,"[in no mood for role-playing] What, Pip? "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17806,Stan,What the hell do you want?! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17808,Stan,You did? [rises and walks to the way] 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17812,Stan,We're going upstairs. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17814,Stan,"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! [crawls into the duct] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17857,Stan,"[mischief flashing across his face] Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17859,Stan,"I don't care, just hurry! [the Angels walk away] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17904,Stan,Rad! [hops on the bed and starts switching channels] 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17906,Stan,There are no more missions. I have everything I want. [four shows and a commercial pass by as he channel-surfs.] 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17908,Stan,[annoyed] Just... play something else! God! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17912,Stan,"Whoa, cool! "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17917,Stan,[as the reporter speaks] Wait a minute [hops off the bed and walks towards the window. He looks out and sees the ATF] Oh my God! [runs back to the others] Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17938,Stan,[rushes out with the others in tow] Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! [sees everyone quite drunk. A naked man dances by with a lampshade on his head] The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. [the adults didn't hear him] 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17940,Stan,"[sees his mom waddle by] Mom, go look outside. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17943,Stan,"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. [walks to the door. The others follow] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17946,Stan,We don't have any weapons. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17949,Stan,Get back inside! [opens the door and the boys hurry in] 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17983,Stan,"[rushes up with the other boys] Dad! Dad, they shot at us. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17985,Stan,Mom! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17988,Stan,"[slaps Butters across the face with a backhand and grabs him by the collar] Get a hold of yourself, man! "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17990,Stan,Come on. We have to find out what's happening. [leads the other boys to the bedroom] 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,17998,Stan,Sh! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18001,Stan,We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18004,Stan,"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. [walks off] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18010,Stan,Tell them not to burn us down. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18013,Stan,[removing the tape from the camera] Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters. 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18015,Stan,"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. [Dougie smiles] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18033,Stan,"Oh no, we're out of time! [hops down and moves away. He ties some rope around Butters' middle] Are you sure you can do this, Butters? "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18035,Stan,"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. [hands him the video] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18037,Stan,"Can you hit a target, Pip? "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18039,Stan,"Hit something nice and solid now. [Pip releases the plunger, with rope attached, and it lands on the left side of Barbrady's head. Barbrady moves just a bit, then sips his coffee] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18041,Stan,"Nice job, Pip. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18043,Stan,"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. [he and Dougie help Butters onto the window sill and hook him up to the rope] "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18045,Stan,He made it down. [Pip and Dougie grin] 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18092,Stan,"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along. "
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18095,Stan,You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins! 
3,8,Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,18097,Stan,Super weak. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18420,Stan,"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. [turns and walks away with Kyle and Kenny] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18426,Stan,Christmas? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18448,Stan,W-we weren't scared! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18455,Stan,That's just an old legend. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18460,Stan,I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18469,Stan,"Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18472,Stan,"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! [all turn left and walk off. As they walk towards the shore, they pass a shack. After they pass, three pirate ghosts peek out from behind the shack, scowling] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18498,Stan,"[walks up with Kyle and Kenny] Come on, fatass, we have to go! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18502,Stan,"Yes you can, porky. [Liane giggles again] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18509,Stan,"Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18511,Stan,What's the scariest thing we could get? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18513,Stan,"No! [turns, then says gravely] A dead body. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18516,Stan,"We could never make one that looks real enough. [his voice lowers] To be really scary, it would have to be real. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18519,Stan,[voice low] We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18521,Stan,"[appeasing] Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right? "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18526,Stan,"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone, "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18528,Stan,"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18532,Stan,"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18534,Stan,"Well, let's dig 'er up! [walks to the grave and jabs his shovel in] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18536,Stan,Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18539,Stan,"You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?! "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18541,Stan,"Yes you do! Now, dig! [all four begin to dig] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18544,Stan,"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three! [they pry the door open, and then jump back and peer in] Whoa, dude. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18550,Stan,"[chuckling] Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18553,Stan,"Okay, grab the sled. [Kenny goes and pulls it up. The others stand aside. When the sled abuts the casket, Cartman pulls at the corpse with his shovel, and it falls forward onto the sled] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18556,Stan,"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18561,Stan,Who was that? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18565,Stan,"Dude, not cool. This is scary. [Some rustling, and a member of KoRn shows up] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18569,Stan,"Hay, you're that band KoRn. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18574,Stan,What are you guys doing out here? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18576,Stan,"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18578,Stan,Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18580,Stan,"[points to it] Yeah, dude. It's right over there. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18586,Stan,"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. [Cartman hides the body behind the boxes] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18588,Stan,"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! [they start walking away] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18629,Stan,[a cowboy sheriff in white] Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. [Kyle is a clown in a yellow jacket] 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18631,Stan,"Where's your costume, fatass? "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18633,Stan,"Hey, Kenny. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18636,Stan,[rushes his friends along] Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! [Cartman goes for the sled] This is gonna be sweet 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18638,Stan,What's the problem? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18643,Stan,She has to be here! [Kenny meanders] 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18672,Stan,"We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away. "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18701,Stan,Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18703,Stan,How should we split up? 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18716,Stan,This place gives me the creeps. 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18745,Stan,We've got to hide! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18751,Stan,Ow! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18799,Stan,There she is! 
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18807,Stan,"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! [the cutout shakes and falls away, revealing Nibblet] "
3,10,Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,18814,Stan,Boo! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18861,Stan,"Hey, fatass. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18863,Stan,"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18888,Stan,What are these? They're Chinpokomon! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18893,Stan,"Yeah, like ancient history. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18895,Stan,"No, dude! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18899,Stan,"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18902,Stan,The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18904,Stan,[exasperated] Ogh..! 
3,11,Chinpokomon,18908,Stan,"Yeah, get with the times, dude. [turns and walks away with Cartman and Kenny] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18940,Stan,"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,18955,Stan,"Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19018,Stan,"[arrives with Kenny] How's it goin', fat ass? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19020,Stan,What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19022,Stan,We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. [moves Kenny so the glazed eyes can be seen] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19025,Stan,Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19028,Stan,You didn't know that? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19030,Stan,"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19033,Stan,"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19051,Stan,Can you see anything? [the gorilla Chinpokomon appears onscreen] 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19053,Stan,"It's starting, it's starting! "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19075,Stan,"Juuhachi desu ka? [""Isn't it eighteen?""] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19078,Stan,"Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19082,Stan,"He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."" "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19132,Stan,"Yeah, dude. That was totally gay. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19150,Stan,Totally gay. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19179,Stan,"Kore wa watashi no uchi desu. [""This is my home now.""] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19204,Stan,"Nan da kore? [""What's this?""] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19206,Stan,What? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19208,Stan,You like it? 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19215,Stan,"[holding a Chuchunezumi] No. [the adults laugh, and he throws the Chuchunezumi away] Screw this, dude. [starts walking out] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19217,Stan,"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. [walks away] "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19223,Stan,"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19228,Stan,"[flatly] Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19232,Stan,"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19234,Stan,...Ye-eah. 
3,11,Chinpokomon,19236,Stan,"Oh... Wait. [walks with the plane] Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes. "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19242,Stan,"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards? "
3,11,Chinpokomon,19245,Stan,What the..? [Kenny's body rips open and a bunch of rats crawl out of him.] 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19274,Stan,"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. [the left side of the groups is shown. Mark, the new kid seen earlier, sits next to Tolkien, and Rebecca takes the aisle seat. The others in their section study them.] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19317,Stan,"[standing before the stage with Cartman and Kenny] Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19324,Stan,We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19328,Stan,What's that? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19333,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19335,Stan,"You shut up, [backhand slap] gaywad! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19338,Stan,"No, we're friends. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19340,Stan,What? 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19342,Stan,"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19382,Stan,"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19385,Stan,"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19389,Stan,"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me."" "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19391,Stan,"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19393,Stan,All right. [backhand slap] 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19395,Stan,"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19399,Stan,"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. [moves out of the way as Craig and Butters position the ball] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19447,Stan,"[tsk] Aw, man, if you have to. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19450,Stan,"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. [laughs] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19453,Stan,"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19458,Stan,"Ah, dude, you don't say that. "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19462,Stan,Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19507,Stan,"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going? "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19509,Stan,"Well, get your ass out of bed! [Kenny walks off] We have to go deal with that home-school kid! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19512,Stan,But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19516,Stan,"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19545,Stan,Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole. 
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19547,Stan,"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19558,Stan,"[sees Kyle enter and walks to him] Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? [with him are Craig, Butters, and Cartman.] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19560,Stan,"Oh, brother! [shows his displeasure to the others] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19562,Stan,"You suck now, Kyle! [walks away with the other boys] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19586,Stan,"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle! "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19590,Stan,"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. [Butters walks up] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19592,Stan,"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? [Craig walks up] "
3,12,Hooked on Monkey Fonics,19604,Stan,"[goes onstage] Nice speech, nerdo. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19646,Stan,What?? 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19651,Stan,"* I told you, fatass. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19658,Stan,Sshh! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19687,Stan,We don't know. [some scratching is heard] 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19702,Stan,[moving past Kyle and Cartman] Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19719,Stan,"Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19733,Stan,"Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19736,Stan,"Kick ass! [Marvin returns to the pilot's seat; the others hop in and stand around him.] Wow, this thing is awesome! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19739,Stan,"[the ship goes higher, over other cities] Wow! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19742,Stan,This is great! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19745,Stan,"Yeah, that's better. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19759,Stan,"Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. [the world map is shown] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19762,Stan,"What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! [a wormhole appears before them, and they head for it] "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19767,Stan,"We're on like, some foreign planet. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19773,Stan,"Uh, thanks. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19775,Stan,"U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19777,Stan,Cool! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19779,Stan,"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19785,Stan,"[Cartman looks in pleasant wonder] Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19787,Stan,Uuh. Thanks. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19795,Stan,"Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19800,Stan,What?? 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19827,Stan,Oh. [the cargo door closes and Marvin is ready to take off] 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19829,Stan,Run for it! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19836,Stan,"He's not done for, he's standing right there. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19842,Stan,"Alright, we made it! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19849,Stan,They're shooting at us. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19853,Stan,"Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19857,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19888,Stan,"You got 'em, Marvin. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19909,Stan,Sally Struthers is saving us! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19913,Stan,Now's our chance! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19924,Stan,"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19935,Stan,"[hushed] Wow! Good job, dude! "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19944,Stan,"Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again. "
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19950,Stan,Maybe we'll come and visit sometime. 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19952,Stan,Dude! 
3,13,Starvin' Marvin in Space,19954,Stan,"I know, but you don't tell him that! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19958,Stan,Ready? 1-2-3-4. [the boys begin to march forward and play.] 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19966,Stan,"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19970,Stan,"Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. [again, the march and play. Cartman gets carried away and the others glare at him] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19977,Stan,"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19984,Stan,"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. [Kyle and Kenny are also present] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19986,Stan,He'd better! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19993,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19995,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,19998,Stan,"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20013,Stan,Hoohoo what a dumbass! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20015,Stan,It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20039,Stan,"Cartman, you can't do that! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20065,Stan,"Run for your life, dude! [the boys run off. Cartman watches from the hill as the battle rages on] "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20083,Stan,"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20138,Stan,"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20140,Stan,Oh here comes the bus. [a tourist bus. Butters is behind the doors waiting to come out. The doors open and Butters exits. The bus leaves] Butters? Are you the only one that came back? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20142,Stan,What battlefield?! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20145,Stan,"[crumples the message into a ball and throws it away] God dammit, that fat piece of shit! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20147,Stan,That would suck so much ass. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20149,Stan,"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20158,Stan,"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20163,Stan,"[now in town] Dad, Dad. [Randy appears and stops] Mom wants you to come home. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20177,Stan,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20182,Stan,I know! But we'll have to wait until dark. 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20186,Stan,"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20200,Stan,"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20217,Stan,"[rushes up with Kyle and Grandpa] Haha! You lose, fatass! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20220,Stan,Where are you going? 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20243,Stan,"[reaches the scene a bit late] Oh, no. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20259,Stan,"[takes the bullhorn] Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20264,Stan,"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20269,Stan,"Aw, dammit! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20287,Stan,"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20289,Stan,"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do? "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20298,Stan,"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20302,Stan,"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering. "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20313,Stan,"[walks over with Kyle] It's finally over, Cartman. You lost! "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20317,Stan,Don't touch me. [Clinton stands up] 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20320,Stan,"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is- "
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20325,Stan,Awwww! 
3,14,The Red Badge of Gayness,20327,Stan,"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home. [he and Kyle walk away with Grandpa] Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton! "

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20706,Stan,"You're making that up! [a woman steps out of a small building, and he addresses her] Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period? "

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20712,Stan,"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20753,Stan,Hello? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20755,Stan,"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20757,Stan,"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways. "

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20794,Stan,So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20851,Stan,"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20853,Stan,No. 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20855,Stan,"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20857,Stan,"Yeah, Cartman told us. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20859,Stan,Okay. 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20861,Stan,"[thinks] ...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20863,Stan,"But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy!

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20888,Stan,"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20890,Stan,So do you know anything that can help him? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20892,Stan,Hormones? [smiles. Mephesto takes him to the medicine cabinet]

3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20900,Stan,"[outside, below] Hey assholes! [the three rise and head for a window] "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20902,Stan,[now with some facial hair] Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones! 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20904,Stan,"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's! "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20907,Stan,So what are we gonna do for New Year's? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20909,Stan,[voice breaking] Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. [walks away. The other three withdraw and resume their discussion] 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20938,Stan,"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs. "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20943,Stan,"[walks up, with a deep boy voice] Have I missed anything? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20946,Stan,"No. I didn't, but- "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20966,Stan,"[goes onstage] Jesus, why does God hate me? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20968,Stan,He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me. 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20970,Stan,"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted? "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20972,Stan,What do you mean? 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20974,Stan,I just wanted my period. 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20992,Stan,I have it. I have the question. [steps forth] Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! [the crowd stands aghast] 
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",20998,Stan,"Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! [people look at him, annoyed] Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay. [looks around] I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?  Should auld acquaintance be forgot [end credits roll] And never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot And auld lang syne? For auld lang syne, my dear, For auld lang syne...    "
3,16,"Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus",21000,Stan," Let's have a cup o  -Aaaa! [mayhem ensues as people riot, breaking wood and glass all around. A gunshot is heard, a couple of women scream, and the rioting goes on] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21015,Stan,What's Arkansas—is that a state? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21040,Stan,"What's ""lose bowel control?"" "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21049,Stan,Who's Karen Carpenter? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21062,Stan,Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. [the other students turn to see the fight] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21079,Stan,We're not rednecks! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21089,Stan,Why?! Don't you know?! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21096,Stan,[reading another book] Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21098,Stan,Damnit! [closes his book] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21100,Stan,You did? [the other three gather around] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21104,Stan,"Damnit Cartman, wha-?! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21106,Stan,Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! [he and the other two return to their books and read on] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21131,Stan,"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21133,Stan,"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21135,Stan,What word could we make up? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21137,Stan,"No, uhno, not finkleroy. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21139,Stan,"Yeah, mung. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21141,Stan,Sh. Here they come. [the New Yorkers arrive] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21143,Stan,You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21148,Stan,We busted you! 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21151,Stan,[the boys stop laughing] It is? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21158,Stan,Ooogh. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21160,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman! "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21188,Stan,I have no idea. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21224,Stan,I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21228,Stan,You found what? 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21231,Stan,"[incredulous, removes his earmuffs] No way. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21237,Stan,"[to Kyle] Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21239,Stan,No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids. 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21293,Stan,"How do we write the note, Cartman? "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21295,Stan,"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. [makes the change] Come on. [the boys leave their room again and head for the New York room.] There. [tapes the music to the door. Kyle sticks a small yellow Post-It note saying ""Revised Music for Tomorrow"" onto the music] That should do it. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21297,Stan,"Okay, let's get back to the room. [the three walk off] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21319,Stan,"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21323,Stan,"Oh no, dude. Look! [the projected music is shown] It's the music we changed! [the camera zooms in on the changed note] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21328,Stan,Stop! Stop! [he and the other three are near the stage...] 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21339,Stan,"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. [Kyle and Cartman grin] "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21344,Stan,"[to Kyle] Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here. "
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21346,Stan,Uuuuh... 
3,17,World Wide Recorder Concert,21351,Stan,You do? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21375,Stan,What the hell's wrong with Cartman?! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21378,Stan,Two dollars! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21380,Stan,For one tooth? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21382,Stan,"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21389,Stan,I already lost all my baby teeth. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21398,Stan,"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21411,Stan,"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21417,Stan,"Uh, Butters, could we have it? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21422,Stan,"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21425,Stan,I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21435,Stan,"[struggling with the pole with Kyle and Kenny] Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21446,Stan,Well? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21461,Stan,Oh my God! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21465,Stan,Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. [he and Kyle grin] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21493,Stan,"[he and the others follow] Dude, where's the money? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21496,Stan,"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21500,Stan,Tell us what?! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21504,Stan,Dude. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21529,Stan,[rushing up] You guys! You guys! I figured it out! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21531,Stan,"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21533,Stan,"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21535,Stan,"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21537,Stan,The kid will never even know. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21540,Stan,We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21543,Stan,"[returns] Come on, Kyle! [grabs him and pulls him along] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21547,Stan,"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the [raises his hands to make quotes] ""Tooth Fairy."" "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21549,Stan,"[A window with stickers on it and a bush underneath is shown] There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21551,Stan,"This is the smartest business venture ever. [Cartman is placed into position, but a blond kid swinging from another pole is lifted into position opposite him] "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21553,Stan,"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21555,Stan,"...Hey, you can't do that! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21557,Stan,Because that's what we're doing! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21565,Stan,You scram! We were here first! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21568,Stan,You woke him up! [Cartman is lowered] 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21572,Stan,Who's the Boss? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21576,Stan,"Uuh, yeah. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21580,Stan,Damnit! And we thought we were so original! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21582,Stan,"Well, uh-what do you mean? "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21585,Stan,"What's a ""tooth trade?"" "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21591,Stan,Amazing. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21596,Stan,Oh. Uh-I don't know. 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21600,Stan,How much do we get if we work for you? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21603,Stan,We're in! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21622,Stan,We all want double-desserts today! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21638,Stan,"U-uh, Chef. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21640,Stan,Chef! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21642,Stan,CHEF! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21644,Stan,We're not dealing drugs! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21646,Stan,No! 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21652,Stan,"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules! "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21654,Stan,"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21715,Stan,"Dude, just stop thinking about it. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21727,Stan,[noticing the silence] Kyle? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21730,Stan,"[notices] Aw, shit. "
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21748,Stan,What? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21752,Stan,Really? 
4,1,The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000,21754,Stan,So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21764,Stan,We win again! [all get off their sleds] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21768,Stan,Sleds are for guys. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21771,Stan,"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21779,Stan,You got it! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21783,Stan,No problem! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21787,Stan,"Oh, boy! We'll show them! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21843,Stan,"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21875,Stan,"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21880,Stan,[answers] Hello? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21882,Stan,Son of a bitch! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21893,Stan,"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21895,Stan,"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21900,Stan,"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21903,Stan,"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! [he, Kyle, and Kenny push off and then hop on as the sled picks up speed. The rest of the kids cheer them on] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21906,Stan,"[looks back at Clyde] Nice going, fat boy! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21920,Stan,"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks [points to them], but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21925,Stan,"Come on, let's get it a try. [he and Kyle get on, and Kenny starts the sled and gets on,] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21927,Stan,Yeah- 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21929,Stan,"[to Kyle] Dude, bail! Bail! [they jump off, leaving Kenny with the brick rider. They end up face down] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21931,Stan,"[looks up] Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21933,Stan,We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. [they walk up to the tree and stand in front of the puddle of blood] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21935,Stan,Nothing else is gonna work. [the rest of the boys converge on the tree] We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21938,Stan,"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21943,Stan,That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21947,Stan,I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21962,Stan,"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21968,Stan,"Yeah, you stupid umbassday! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21971,Stan,...Yeah. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21975,Stan,Sshh! [the guard looks over] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21977,Stan,How are we supposed to give them to you? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21979,Stan,But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21981,Stan,"Alright, here. [pulls some out and slips them through the holes one by one. The guard checks his watch and Cartman packs his ass] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21983,Stan,Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that. 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21989,Stan,That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. [pulls it out] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,21991,Stan,"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22003,Stan,"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22005,Stan,Yeah. [they walk up to the front door of a nice house. Kyle rings the bell] 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22007,Stan,Hi. Can Token come out and play? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22010,Stan,"[sees Tolkien] Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22015,Stan,It's not? 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22021,Stan,"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22047,Stan,"[to Kyle] Okay, go ahead and start. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22049,Stan,"Oh, uhyeah. [walks to the easel and clears his throat] Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" [shows the title page. Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance] Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22052,Stan,"[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall] If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government? "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22054,Stan,"[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22056,Stan,That is our presentation. An idea that we call... 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22082,Stan,"[""Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned he'll be here any second. ""]"
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22087,Stan,"Alright, where's Clyde. "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22089,Stan,"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit! "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22096,Stan,It's Cartman! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22102,Stan,All right! Let's do this! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22110,Stan,"Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! [the camera looks at the slope. The girls come down first, then the boys] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22114,Stan,"We're not gonna make it! [Cartman thinks, then he remembers.] "
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22119,Stan,We did it! 
4,2,Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000,22125,Stan,"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22147,Stan,"Dude, did you do all your homework last night? "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22149,Stan,I know! 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22166,Stan,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22168,Stan,But he is- 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22215,Stan,He doesn't have to do homework? 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22221,Stan,I've got ADD. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22284,Stan,"Dude, it's Timmy. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22293,Stan,"Yeah, Timmy ruhules! "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22295,Stan,But he's funny. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22313,Stan,"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22315,Stan,"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22326,Stan,Because we're on Ritalin. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22334,Stan,Oh boy oh boy. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22337,Stan,"But there are no side effects, Chef. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22341,Stan,See what? 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22399,Stan,Let's watch something else. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22404,Stan,Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up? 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22407,Stan,"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22410,Stan,Sounds good. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22412,Stan,"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22431,Stan,"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow? "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22469,Stan,"Sure was, Dad. "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22472,Stan,"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. [takes a glass. He and Kyle drink at the same time as Chef leaves] "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22478,Stan,I feel... different. 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22483,Stan,Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass! 
4,3,Timmy 2000,22488,Stan,"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy! "
4,3,Timmy 2000,22491,Stan,"No! [steps forward] You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22520,Stan,"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22531,Stan,"Where? [a clown appears next to him, and he looks up] Oh, no. [the clown pulls out an umbrella and a bicycle horn, squeezes the horn and gets showered by the umbrella. The adults laugh, and the clown offers him the umbrella] Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. [the clown insists Stan take part, and the parents laugh at the sound of the horn] No, thank you. [the clown tries again] Go away, please. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22539,Stan,Two hours. 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22546,Stan,"Damn, dude. [...then the Eiffel Tower, and finally, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The crowd cheers] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22557,Stan,"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in? "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22561,Stan,"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. [the boys turn to leave] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22582,Stan,"Dude, this isn't working. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22587,Stan,"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! [Grandpa rolls by and notices the boys in dance poses] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22597,Stan,"I'm tired, Grandpa. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22599,Stan,"I don't know. [walks over and opens the door] Whoa. [before him are the contorting Romanian quintuplets and their Grandmama, all shivering. Randy and Sharon show up in their pajamas] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22647,Stan,"Hurry up, you guys! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22649,Stan,"Dude, you're not gonna believe this. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22656,Stan,Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania. 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22664,Stan,Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22666,Stan,"Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22686,Stan,"Okay, hold it, hold it. [climbs over Cartman and Kyle to form a tower. The quintuplets have executed their X formation. Stan is trying to stand when all three boys tumble to the ground. The quints break their formation and drop down] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22696,Stan,What?! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22700,Stan,[rushes up] Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22702,Stan,They have nowhere else to go. [presses hands together] Please? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22734,Stan,That's your dad? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22743,Stan,"[gets up and runs to his parents] Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you?? "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22750,Stan,No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! [walks off] 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22784,Stan,"Okay, let's try it again. Hup! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22789,Stan,"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22792,Stan,Now what do we do? 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22832,Stan,"[standing in front of the still burning ruins of his house] Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22843,Stan,The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us. 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22845,Stan,"Yeah! Well, not this time! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22847,Stan,"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! [addresses the mob] Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now! "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22852,Stan,"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22862,Stan,Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets! 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22864,Stan,"[whistles a signal] Come on, angry mob! [the mob appears behind him. All of them move forward and overrun the checkpoint. A lagging protester runs over a fallen soldier] "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22883,Stan,Yeah. 
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22897,Stan,"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways. "
4,4,Quintuplets 2000,22900,Stan,Whatever happened to Kenny? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22911,Stan,"Dude, I don't understand this game at all. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22913,Stan,"Um, deny it? "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22917,Stan,Sweet. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22922,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22928,Stan,"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22994,Stan,"Oh, man, that's terrible. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22996,Stan,"Haha, he-yeah ha. [makes his own blow face] Haaaaah. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,22998,Stan,[does the same] Blaaa-lalalalalalala. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23000,Stan,[looks and then faces him. Kyle follows] We're making faces at sick people. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23002,Stan,We don't know. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23006,Stan,"You're not more mature than us, Cartman! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23060,Stan,Yeah. Now what are you going to do? 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23117,Stan,[angry] We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23123,Stan,"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23143,Stan,"We got invited too, fatass! "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23150,Stan,This is boring. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23158,Stan,[to Kyle] That seems kind of... weird. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23195,Stan,Yeah. 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23199,Stan,Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us! 
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23201,Stan,"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! [the boys run into room 1A. Mephesto shows up and leads the other look-alikes onto the hallway] "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23230,Stan,"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23256,Stan,"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you. "
4,5,Cartman Joins NAMBLA,23264,Stan,"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23281,Stan,"[raises his hand] Here! [he, Kenny, and Cartman laugh heartily] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23287,Stan,"Dude, what the hell was that? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23289,Stan," ...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23291,Stan,You have to be drinking milk for that to happen. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23294,Stan,[drawn out] He's fakin'! 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23302,Stan,"Now, that's a get-well card! [the others laugh. Cartman soon joins them, but his nose begins to leak that white liquid again. He covers his nostrils and continues laughing] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23322,Stan,"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. [Kyle mumbles once more] Kyle? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23325,Stan,"Go on, Butters! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23327,Stan,"Butters, go on! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23329,Stan,"Dude, you really are sick, huh? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23359,Stan,"Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23361,Stan,"Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23374,Stan,What? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23380,Stan,Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23382,Stan,Don't be a smartass? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23389,Stan,"Hi, doctor. [takes a seat] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23391,Stan,"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23393,Stan,But I don't think it's working. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23395,Stan,[overwhelmed] Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23397,Stan,"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23399,Stan,"Who? [Dr. Doctor turns the sheet around, and Cartman's picture is on it. A close-up reveals that Cartman has AB-negative blood] Oh, shit. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23413,Stan,"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23415,Stan,"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23417,Stan,What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23419,Stan,"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but it's obviously not working. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23421,Stan,Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23423,Stan,"But you only need one, fat boy! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23425,Stan,"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23428,Stan,Oh my God! 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23431,Stan,"Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23434,Stan,"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23436,Stan,"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. [they walk away] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23465,Stan,You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23467,Stan,"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23470,Stan,Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23472,Stan,And that has something to do with their medicines because...? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23475,Stan,"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23477,Stan,"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23479,Stan,"I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. [Kenny gets mad, Stan gets resolute] Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! [walks away] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23484,Stan,"[checks his watch] Come on, where are they? [looks around. Three boys approach from his left: Kenny, Butters, and Timmy] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23485,Stan,This is it?? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23488,Stan,This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle?? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23490,Stan,"[quite disappointed] Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23492,Stan,We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. [the others look are shocked] 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23513,Stan,"[softly] Okay, it's clear. [slowly opens the front door] Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23515,Stan,Sshhh! 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23517,Stan,"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23520,Stan,"Alright Butters, let's go. [they walk away and up the stairs, then down the hall, but Stan stops in his tracks] Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. [Fluffy is seen sleeping in her own little bed. Stan and Butters try to sneak past, but she opens her eyes] Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. [Butters accidentally steps on Fluffy's tail and she squeals in panic. This wakes Cartman, who blinks and heads for his door half-asleep] Come on, we gotta get outta here! [runs a bit, then has his back to the wall as Cartman opens the door and walks out] Oh, no! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23523,Stan,"Oh, phew. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23526,Stan,"Okay, here we go. [opens the book and leafs through. Pictures of the heart, fingers, liver, and cutaway of the male genitalia are shown. Stan giggles softly and turns the page to a picture of the kidney] Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here... "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23528,Stan,"...vein right, well- [brings out the saw] Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. [Butters pulls the sheets, Stan the shirt, and something more is in their way] No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23530,Stan,"You suck, Cartman! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23532,Stan,"God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23553,Stan,"[despondent, voice cracking] There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23555,Stan,"[sobs] My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. [begins to break down] Oh, God, he's my best friend... [weeps] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23558,Stan,Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! [weeps] 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23588,Stan,So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital? 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23590,Stan,"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23595,Stan,"Dude, please. Kyle needs it. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23597,Stan,"Alright, alright, here. [hands him a bloody kidney. Cartman reviews it.] "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23610,Stan,You look a lot better. 
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23613,Stan,"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23616,Stan,"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you! "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23618,Stan,"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney. "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23623,Stan,"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been? "
4,6,Cherokee Hair Tampons,23627,Stan,"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. [laughs a long time with Kyle] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23654,Stan,You don't even know what you're debating about half the time! 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23663,Stan,"Uh... that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23709,Stan,"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23717,Stan,Islam?? 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23719,Stan,"Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23722,Stan,"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23724,Stan,"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about, it's-- "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23789,Stan,"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this! "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23794,Stan,"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side. "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23798,Stan,"Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. [Mr. Broflovski enters] "
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23801,Stan,Do you think they should change the flag? 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23808,Stan,That was a good one. 
4,7,Chef Goes Nanners,23964,Stan,"[recovered, looks at the flag] Wait, I don't get it. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23988,Stan,Boy band? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,23992,Stan,"Dude, we don't have any musical talent. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24001,Stan,He's right. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24005,Stan,"Well, I guess. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24007,Stan,"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. [Randy reacts, and Shelly takes notice] "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24010,Stan,"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24012,Stan,[voice shaking] Cartman says we can make $10 million. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24023,Stan,"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24025,Stan,"[reads from a list] Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24038,Stan,"Aw, come on, dude. Let her try. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24046,Stan,"Come on, nobody's gonna notice. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24048,Stan,She's the best chance we have! I say she's in. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24055,Stan,"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24057,Stan,Costumes? [the band gathers around the box] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24059,Stan,"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24069,Stan,"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24072,Stan,Kenny says that's not what it means. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24082,Stan,"[to Kyle] Uh oh, mall cops. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24088,Stan,"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24127,Stan,Yeah. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24129,Stan,Uh-oh. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24185,Stan,We are making a music video. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24187,Stan,"Dad, I was just a-- "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24190,Stan,"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24192,Stan,"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24194,Stan,No. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24196,Stan,Dad! 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24227,Stan,"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band? "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24229,Stan,"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24231,Stan,"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever-- "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24233,Stan,Dad? What the hell is going on? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24280,Stan,Jesus Christ. ...I never knew. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24282,Stan,[left with his thoughts] ...Oh-kay. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24296,Stan,[enters] Dad? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24298,Stan,"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24300,Stan,Yeah. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24302,Stan,Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24304,Stan,Really? 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24306,Stan,Alright! [father and son get up and leave the bedroom. Randy tosses his magazine aside] 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24324,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24332,Stan,"Oh, yes we do. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24339,Stan,"You were great, Dad. "
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24350,Stan,Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have. 
4,8,Something You Can Do with Your Finger,24352,Stan,"[""I don't think they sell those anymore. [gets up and follows his dad off Wendy gets up and follows him] ""]"
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24357,Stan,[to Kenny] Bo-ring. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24362,Stan,"[as Mackey speaks] Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."" "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24366,Stan,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"" "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24405,Stan,"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24407,Stan,"We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! [turns around, runs to the altar, and turns right. Kenny follows him] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24429,Stan,[quite afraid] Are we gonna go to hell? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24432,Stan,What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24437,Stan,But crackers are his- body. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24445,Stan,"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24447,Stan,No?? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24458,Stan,"Confession? [Kenny snaps to attention, jarring music plays in the background] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24484,Stan,"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24486,Stan,And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24489,Stan,We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24491,Stan,Have you confessed all your sins yet? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24498,Stan,"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24500,Stan,"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24504,Stan,"What, Butters? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24511,Stan,"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24513,Stan,I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24529,Stan,"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo- "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24531,Stan,"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24533,Stan,The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24535,Stan,"[""I don't know. You can't see him it's just some anonymous guy. ""]"
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24542,Stan,"...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble- "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24544,Stan,God damnit! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24546,Stan,"[notices someone and points] Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy. [he and Kenny walk over to her. She's kneeling before a table of candles and a portrait of Jesus] Sister Anne? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24548,Stan,We have a question. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24550,Stan,Where do handicapped people go when they die? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24552,Stan,"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24565,Stan,What happened?? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24605,Stan,I don't think so. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24622,Stan,Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. [the boys exit] 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24624,Stan,"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more. "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24628,Stan,Cartman! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24630,Stan,"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24632,Stan,"Oh, shit! [covers his mouth with his gloves.] Oh! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24635,Stan,But what about them? 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24638,Stan,"Okay, come on. [he, Cartman, and Kenny leave] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24670,Stan,Come on! This stupid light won't change. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24672,Stan,We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24675,Stan,"Uh, come on, let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but...] "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24677,Stan,"[finally reacts, shrilly] ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24680,Stan,He's doomed. 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24703,Stan,[tries to open it] Oh no! It's locked! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24706,Stan,[sees something off to the side] Confession box is over there! [moves towards it] 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24713,Stan,You're a sinner! 
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24718,Stan,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us? "
4,9,Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?,24729,Stan,"[passes out material] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. [from a child's view, the pamphlet is seen. It's called ""Kids Against Hell"" and has a quote from Ezekiel 5:10. It is soon lowered for a good shot at the growing crowd of kids at the street corner] "
4,10,Probably,24744,Stan,"Let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified] "
4,10,Probably,24745,Stan,"[finally reacts, shrilly] ...they've killed Kenny! "
4,10,Probably,24760,Stan,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us? "
4,10,Probably,24772,Stan,"[joins Cartman on the platform] Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs. "
4,10,Probably,24775,Stan,What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven. 
4,10,Probably,24819,Stan,There's no way God will want to send us to hell now. 
4,10,Probably,24828,Stan,"Wow, cool. "
4,10,Probably,24832,Stan,Yeah! 
4,10,Probably,24841,Stan,What? 
4,10,Probably,24843,Stan,Kenny?! [move towards the phone] What's he say? 
4,10,Probably,25035,Stan,"Dude, that seems kind of... weird. "
4,10,Probably,25062,Stan,What worked? 
4,10,Probably,25067,Stan,Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars? 
4,10,Probably,25069,Stan,"[he and Kyle are now angry] Well, what about going to hell and all that?! "
4,10,Probably,25075,Stan,"Dude, I am so disillusioned right now. "
4,10,Probably,25108,Stan,Yeah! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25139,Stan,"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25145,Stan,"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up. [looks left and sees someone] Hey, come here [signals a boy, Pete Thelman, over.] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25147,Stan,What grade are you going into? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25149,Stan,Stupid third grader! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25154,Stan,Denver? [Butters and Clyde arrive] 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25157,Stan,"Alright. [turns to face the gathering group] Hey, listen up everybody! [Tweek and four others arrive, then Timmy...] We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! [the other kids smile] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25159,Stan,"[with a look of determination] Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25163,Stan,"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25166,Stan,"Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25170,Stan,"We got you covered, Timmy. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25176,Stan,"Dude, look at the walls. [A new alphabet strip in Vivaldi font hangs over the chalkboard] Everything is written in some strange, foreign language. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25181,Stan,"[softly, to Kyle] ...More like, Ms. Makes-me-sick. [starts chuckling] "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25193,Stan,What a bitch! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25197,Stan,This is it. The end of innocence. [grows sad] This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents warned us about. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25205,Stan,"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25207,Stan,[a bit dramatic] We travel back in time. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25210,Stan,It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25218,Stan,"We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25250,Stan,Back in the third grade. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25254,Stan,Oh! Here she comes. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25272,Stan,Yeah! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25276,Stan,"Timmy, you have to stop! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25278,Stan,No?? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25284,Stan,"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows? "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25286,Stan,My God! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25290,Stan,"Over here, over here! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25310,Stan,Less than 20 minutes?! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25353,Stan,"Well, who didn't see that coming? "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25361,Stan,"...nine, eight... "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25381,Stan,Dude! You gotta build us another time machine! 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25385,Stan,W-what did you get in a fight about? 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25387,Stan,"Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25391,Stan,"Alright, come on, guys. [the boys exit the basement and head up the stairs] Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25412,Stan,"God-damnit, this is ridiculous. "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25414,Stan,"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade? "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25423,Stan,I know. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25425,Stan,Wait a minute! I've got it. [knocks again] 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25427,Stan,"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25468,Stan,"Oh, son of a bitch! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25478,Stan,[softly] Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25481,Stan,Dude. Sh-she's right. 
4,11,Fourth Grade,25483,Stan,"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?! "
4,11,Fourth Grade,25489,Stan,"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25505,Stan,"Dude, what's your little brother doing here? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25507,Stan,But isn't he only three years old? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25511,Stan,Cool! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25513,Stan,"Wow, cool! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25523,Stan,"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25525,Stan,But they smell like pee. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25529,Stan,Aren't you a little old to be in grade school? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25537,Stan,"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25579,Stan,"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25592,Stan,"Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! [just then, spikes come out of the Trapper Keeper and some of them go clear through ""Bill's"" hands.] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25595,Stan,[confused] What the hell just happened? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25630,Stan,"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25635,Stan,"Wow, that's amazing. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25637,Stan,"What do you think, Officer Barbrady? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25641,Stan,"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25643,Stan,Yes! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25668,Stan,"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby? "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25671,Stan,Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25676,Stan,"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25682,Stan,Cartman! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25688,Stan,"Yeah, that's fine. [""Bill"" aims the phaser once again] No, wait! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25690,Stan,Can I do it? 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25692,Stan,"[takes it and quickly aims] Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25694,Stan,"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25696,Stan,He's right there. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25729,Stan,Uh-oh. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25732,Stan,"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. [he and Kenny leave the table, with Kyle following] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25735,Stan,"[knocks on the door] Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! [Cartman hops off his chair and dances to the door. He locks it and continues singing] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25742,Stan,"[pounds on the door] Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. [he and Kyle now notice the groans coming from the room] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25744,Stan,You break it down! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25746,Stan,"Not it! You lose, Kenny. [he and Kyle quickly step out of the way] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25748,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25770,Stan,"Then we have to stop it before it gets there! [leads the others off the bluff and onto a waiting cruiser. ""Bill"" takes the wheel and Kyle takes the passenger window seat] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25775,Stan,"Cartman, you have to stop! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25778,Stan,He is in there. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25780,Stan,"One-two-three, not it! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25804,Stan,Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to. 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25810,Stan,"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. [an indecisive appendage hovers over Rosie] "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25816,Stan,"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25820,Stan,He did it! 
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25839,Stan,"You did it, Kyle! [to Cartman] Kyle saved your life, fat ass! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25841,Stan,"Huh, that's a bitch. "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25843,Stan,"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you! "
4,12,Trapper Keeper,25845,Stan,Cartman! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25851,Stan,"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do. "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25856,Stan,[very slurred - John Keller] E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25858,Stan,'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace. 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25862,Stan,Uh-eally? Uh you think so? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25874,Stan,"Oh yeah, we can't! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25925,Stan,You do? 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,25992,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26057,Stan,"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. [Timmy rolls slowly in ] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26059,Stan,"Where's Gobbles, Timmy? "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26083,Stan," No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.   "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26085,Stan,Helen! 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26087,Stan,Oh no! [they lean on each other] 
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26139,Stan,"Okay, here we go. [the kids are still backstage, but in their street clothes] "
4,13,Helen Keller! The Musical,26146,Stan,We worked our asses off to compete with that?! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26448,Stan,"[holding his knife] I can't do it, dude. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26453,Stan,Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26490,Stan,[off-screen] That's so gross. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26494,Stan,I'll throw in five. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26502,Stan,"[off-screen, enticing] Forty-one bucks. [Kenny jumps up and starts eating it. The others groan and moan] Eww-ho-hoo! He did it! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26533,Stan,"Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. [Clyde and Tolkien come in from the right, Wendy and Bebe come in from the left. Stan comforts Kenny.] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26536,Stan,"Well, at least you got it out of your system. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26541,Stan,"Oh, you guys! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26550,Stan,"You know, dude, there might be something to this. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26588,Stan,We knew he wouldn't make it. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26592,Stan,I don't believe it. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26602,Stan,Did you like the old one? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26617,Stan,"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing. "
4,15,Fat Camp,26624,Stan,[to Kyle] What's a prostitute? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26629,Stan,"Chef, what's a prostitute? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26631,Stan,"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26633,Stan,"Chef, what's a prostitute? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26638,Stan,Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26640,Stan,Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26645,Stan,Like what? 
4,15,Fat Camp,26647,Stan,No. 
4,15,Fat Camp,26683,Stan,Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26686,Stan,"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up? "
4,15,Fat Camp,26753,Stan,[enters and runs to the stage] You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26755,Stan,For giving Howard Stern a hummer! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26757,Stan,I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months! 
4,15,Fat Camp,26759,Stan,"I know! [Kyle gets an idea. He and Stan descend the steps to talk to the new Cartman, who stands nearby] "
4,15,Fat Camp,26774,Stan,"[walks up and puts the hood back on the new Kenny] Deal, druggie! "
4,15,Fat Camp,26809,Stan,"[pointing] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26815,Stan,[rushes up with Cartman and Kenny] Dude! [Kyle looks] You're not gonna believe what Cartman has! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26819,Stan,We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26831,Stan,"[blinks at Cartman, who blinks back] Well, of course your parents said you can't go! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26866,Stan,"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26871,Stan,The police? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26877,Stan,But what do the police do to them? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26897,Stan,"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26904,Stan,What's going on? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,26909,Stan,[steps forward] ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27016,Stan,"You guys, stop it! [glides down from a tall pole in the school gym and jumps to a spot in front of the couple] Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27019,Stan,How come you wanna help the fatass?! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27023,Stan,"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27027,Stan,"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27029,Stan,"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass? "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27031,Stan,Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27034,Stan,"[with a torch, walks up to a chalk drawing on a wall of a family] Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. [a drawing of broccoli is shown] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27036,Stan,"[walks past a drawing of Cartman] And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. [stops at a drawing of two police officers arresting an adult, with a squad car in the background], by using the magic M word. [a large M is shown] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27038,Stan,"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. [a drawing of a statue] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27040,Stan,"The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. [an angry Provider shoots bolts of lightning from his body, and two victims are at his feet] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27044,Stan,"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. [the two books are shown, with the line between them] "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27046,Stan,"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27048,Stan,Yes. No foolies. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27076,Stan,[receives it] Awesu-home! 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27100,Stan,"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27104,Stan,"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27113,Stan,[all the kids turn from the altar and face the couple] Parents? 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27118,Stan,"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27128,Stan,"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27130,Stan,"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner. "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27132,Stan,"Hey, you guys came back! "
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27156,Stan,Huh. 
4,16,The Wacky Molestation Adventure,27159,Stan,I dunno. [to Kyle and Cartman] You guys wanna build a snow igloo? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27175,Stan,[picks up the phone] A-ah huh. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27177,Stan,Ho-o-oh. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27180,Stan,"What is this all about, Kyle? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27212,Stan,"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27223,Stan,"Nobody's paying any attention. [Amber clears her throat as a foot comes down over Simon, and the foot pulls away] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27227,Stan,[emotionally] This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27237,Stan,"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. [Cartman clicks the remote, and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" pops up. Charlie, Lucy, and Snoopy are on screen] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27240,Stan,How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27244,Stan,"[affecting a Peanuts accent] And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27247,Stan,"What, dude? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27249,Stan,We don't know anything about animation. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27253,Stan,"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" [onscreen, Snoopy is pummeling a naked Charlie Brown hard across the face with a 2-by-4] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27261,Stan,"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27282,Stan,[impatient] Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27286,Stan,"[retorts] That's not me, that's you! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27292,Stan,"[grabs the poster] No, that's okay. [walks away] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27322,Stan,"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27336,Stan,Hey! Wait a minute! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27338,Stan,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27340,Stan,"[calmly] Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. [Kyle cues the piano player, who begins playing] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27346,Stan,"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! [the sound man begins to laugh heartily] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27348,Stan,What's awesome? 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27350,Stan,That's not in the script They do this all the time. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27354,Stan,Easy. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27356,Stan,"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27358,Stan,Okay. [snaps the shot] One. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27360,Stan,Kickass! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27362,Stan,"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. [both turn aside to look around] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27364,Stan,[softly] E mouths... 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27367,Stan,[snap] 1 [snap] 2. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27369,Stan,"""We wish you a m- Merry"" "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27392,Stan,AAAAAAAA! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27395,Stan,"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27398,Stan,"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27400,Stan,"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27403,Stan, We love   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27405,Stan, Tralala   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27407,Stan, We sit.   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27409,Stan, Tralalalala   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27414,Stan,"""Awgh! I'm so fat!"" "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27416,Stan,"[with tongue filling his mouth] ""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"" "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27419,Stan," [Doing his and Cartman's parts] Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help? Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!   "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27421,Stan,"Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! [both boys grin, and the sound man signals his approval with a thumbs-up] "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27424,Stan, We wish   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27426,Stan, Tralalalala   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27428,Stan, We sit.   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27430,Stan, Tralalalala   
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27434,Stan,...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. [they resume singing and walk away] 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27447,Stan,Hey! Wait a minute! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27449,Stan,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27451,Stan,"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas! "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27453,Stan,You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27469,Stan,For nothing. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27502,Stan,"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing. "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27504,Stan,[angrily] No not ham! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27509,Stan,...Christmas is about something much more important! 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27511,Stan,[voice softens] Presents. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27513,Stan,"Don't you see, Kyle? "
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27515,Stan,Presents. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27528,Stan,Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head. 
4,17,A Very Crappy Christmas,27531,Stan,Wow! Count me in! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27537,Stan,What? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27541,Stan,"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27545,Stan,So? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27551,Stan,What?! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27557,Stan,"They can't say ""shit"" on television! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27559,Stan,Holy fucking shit! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27566,Stan,"Aw, come, on dude! This is history. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27595,Stan,Sh! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27612,Stan,"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"" "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27615,Stan,"Where are you going, Kyle? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27617,Stan,"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27619,Stan,Oh. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27637,Stan,I can't believe they actually said it. [Kyle returns with some food] 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27650,Stan,"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27656,Stan,Me neither. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27698,Stan,"This sucks. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27700,Stan,What's meecrob? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27703,Stan,What? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27707,Stan,What's that? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27737,Stan,"What's the Black Death, Chef? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27746,Stan,"Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. [points] "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27748,Stan,Word of curse? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27751,Stan,Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27756,Stan,Holy shit! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27759,Stan,Uh oh. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27794,Stan,"Now what are we gonna do, Chef? "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27797,Stan,Oh shit! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27813,Stan,What are we supposed to do with it? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27824,Stan,It might hold the key to a curse. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27826,Stan,"Dude, we need help from the British! "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27830,Stan,You know what it is? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27846,Stan,"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27880,Stan,"Look, there's the F-word. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27884,Stan,All the world destroyed? 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27911,Stan,Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back. 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27920,Stan,"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English. "
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27931,Stan,Yeah! And Kenny didn't die! 
5,1,It Hits the Fan,27933,Stan,Holy shi- [quickly taps his mouth with his hands and releases] poop. 
5,2,Cripple Fight,27937,Stan,"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27941,Stan,"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. [all but Cartman laugh] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27943,Stan,"[calling to the back] Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy?? "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27953,Stan,"Hey, it's Big Gay Al! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27959,Stan,"See ya, Dad! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27985,Stan,"Jimmy's funny, dude. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27991,Stan,"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club? "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27994,Stan,"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow? "
5,2,Cripple Fight,27997,Stan,"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28002,Stan,"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28004,Stan,"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28006,Stan,"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28009,Stan,"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose. [Randy bears down on the brakes, causing Timmy to roll backwards and into the back window] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28012,Stan,"[a bit softly, eyes fixed on his fater] I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28015,Stan,"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh- "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28017,Stan,[glances at Cartman] ...Asshole. [looks at Randy again] 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28021,Stan,"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! [Jimmy walks up on crutches to the mic and begins] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28109,Stan,"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28112,Stan,Kicked out? Oh no! 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28118,Stan,"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week. "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28122,Stan,What do we want? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28124,Stan,When do we want it? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28126,Stan,What do we want? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28128,Stan,When do we want it? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28130,Stan,What do we want? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28133,Stan,When do we want it? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28136,Stan,What do we want? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28138,Stan,When do we want it? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28140,Stan,"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. [a little girl stands at the market's entrance] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28143,Stan,"Alright, let's set up. [the table's legs come down and Cartman's picket is hung in front of the table. A mic and sound system are set up next to the table. A customer exits the market, and Stan whips out a petition board] Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? [the customer gets away, but another one comes] Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? [the customers ignore him] Goddamnit! [All the while Timmy looks down angrily at Jimmy] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28145,Stan,"That's a great idea! [takes the mic] Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy! "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28153,Stan,"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. [he and Cartman leave the table and go towards Jimmy and Timmy. Timmy and Jimmy face off and start circling each other] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28169,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude! [a crowd begins to gather] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28213,Stan,We did it! We did it! 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28219,Stan,Huh? 
5,2,Cripple Fight,28223,Stan,"So wait, did we do good? "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28234,Stan,"[opens Timmy's bedroom door and enters. Timmy stops work to listen] Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! [walks out] "
5,2,Cripple Fight,28244,Stan,"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28250,Stan,"What's going on? [he and Kyle have ice cream cones. He has vanilla, Kyle strawberry] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28276,Stan,How'd he do that?? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28279,Stan,No way! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28286,Stan,His a-miracles? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28289,Stan,Yeah! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28319,Stan,"[talking to a boy between him and Cartman] Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28321,Stan,"No, I'm Stan. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28323,Stan,Who are you? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28326,Stan,"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28328,Stan,"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28330,Stan,"I don't care! I'm leaving! [walks towards the door, but a man blocks the way] 'Scuse me. [eerie music begins] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28332,Stan,I'm going home. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28334,Stan,You said we're free to leave whenever we want 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28336,Stan,Move out of the way. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28338,Stan,"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28340,Stan,"[begins to back away, intimidated] That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28343,Stan,"Okay, it's all clear. [exits with Kyle] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28345,Stan,We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28347,Stan,"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28349,Stan,A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28351,Stan,"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28353,Stan,"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28355,Stan,"Oh wait, who am I again? "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28357,Stan,"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. [pulls out his hat and puts it on] Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28359,Stan,"Kyle, please. You- [looks down and to the left, then looks up] You're my best friend. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28395,Stan,"HaaAAAA! [the car totals the bike, bumps Stan onto the sidewalk, and peels away.] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28398,Stan,"Hi, Jesus. It's me. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28402,Stan,This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28404,Stan,"I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28406,Stan,Can you do it again? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28408,Stan,That's it? That's how you did that trick? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28410,Stan,"That trick sucks, Jesus. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28412,Stan,"Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28414,Stan,"But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28438,Stan,Then what are we going to do. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28440,Stan,Super best friends? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28446,Stan,To where? 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28448,Stan,[shuts his eyes] I am ready. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28451,Stan,Yeah. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28469,Stan,"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends? "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28472,Stan,Wow. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28503,Stan,I knew it. 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28508,Stan,"Wow, the Moses. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28545,Stan,[emerges from the crowd and looks around the Reflecting Pool] Kyle! Kyle! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28547,Stan,"Kyle?? [frantically, he goes into the pool and reaches the boy, turning him over. A few seconds of observation and... gasp] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28549,Stan,"Kyle? [looks to his left and calls out] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28551,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28558,Stan,[reaches Kyle] Kyle! 
5,3,Super Best Friends,28560,Stan,"Kyle, you can't kill yourself! "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28584,Stan,"Kyle, you have to hold your breath! [a giant stone hand comes down and grabs the bubble as Stan looks on helplessly. Everyone backs away from the stone Lincoln as it holds Kyle in its left hand. Lincoln shakes Kyle around like a snow globe, and Stan gets mad] Oh, very funny! [Seaman and Joseph Smith pour the raw materials needed for a statue into Jesus' mold, and Mohammad fires the statue like a piece of clay. The likeness of John Wilkes Booth appears on the statue] "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28600,Stan,"[with mic. Kyle and Cartman stand some distance to his left] Listen up, everyone! [the Super Best Friends gather behind him] You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all. "
5,3,Super Best Friends,28603,Stan,"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28613,Stan,What's no big deal? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28619,Stan,Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28622,Stan,"He's lying. [turns and walks away. Kenny follows, then Kyle] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28626,Stan,"[looks away and hides his eyes] We don't wanna see them, Cartman! [Kyle turns around, Kenny shuts his hood tight] "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28630,Stan,What?? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28634,Stan,"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28638,Stan,"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass! "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28681,Stan,One please. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28771,Stan,"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28835,Stan,"[looks over at Kenny's corpse] Oh my God, he killed Kenny. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28842,Stan,Got what all figured out? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28848,Stan,Yeah. 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28907,Stan,"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman. "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28911,Stan,"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet? "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28944,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude!  "
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28947,Stan,Who are you? 
5,4,Scott Tenorman Must Die,28959,Stan,Good call. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28969,Stan,"Oh man, this is another rerun. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28981,Stan,Because I had an itch up my ass. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28987,Stan,When are they gonna make new ones? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28989,Stan,What's this? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28993,Stan,Enough! I know! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,28997,Stan,Dude! Did you get 'em? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29001,Stan,Yep. Tomorrow night. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29011,Stan,"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29018,Stan,"No, dude, we really, really do. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29022,Stan,Huh? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29033,Stan,"Yeah, he looks terrible. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29035,Stan,Uuuuhh. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29042,Stan,Phillip? That's not Phillip. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29065,Stan,"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this. [they reach the dressing room, but a bouncer stands in the way] 'Scuse us. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29069,Stan,It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29072,Stan,You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29075,Stan,"Man, this sucks! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29079,Stan,I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29105,Stan,"We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29109,Stan,But where's Phillip? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29115,Stan,"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29117,Stan,What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us? 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29127,Stan,"Oh no, dude. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29131,Stan,"They're not together anymore, dude. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29135,Stan,But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29160,Stan,"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? [Kenny continues playing with his plane] "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29164,Stan,[reaching Phillip] Phillip! Phillip! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29166,Stan,Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29168,Stan,"[stammering] Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and- "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29170,Stan,But we need you! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29174,Stan,"He'll do it, dude. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29180,Stan,Two thousand dollars. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29182,Stan,"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29189,Stan,I'm sure they'll be here any minute. 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29192,Stan,Oh my God! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29201,Stan,"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29207,Stan,Fine! [the boys leave the stage] 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29261,Stan,"[panting] Okay. Okay, I think we lost them. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29265,Stan,"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason. "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29269,Stan,"Go! Run run run! [Kyle wails, Kenny keeps up somehow] "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29281,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, hurry up! "
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29301,Stan,They're back! 
5,5,Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow,29304,Stan,It sure did. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29343,Stan,"""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!"" [Stan's face appears, and it's instantly clear that the car and Lopez are dolls] ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."" "
5,6,Cartmanland,29345,Stan,"""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."" [inserts a small firework next to Lopez in the tiny car] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29347,Stan,"Yeah, awesome! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29349,Stan,...Why? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29353,Stan,"You'd better not be lying, Kenny. [the three walk out of view.] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29371,Stan,Oh my God. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29374,Stan,"Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29379,Stan,"Yeah, it's unbelievable. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29381,Stan,"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. [walks away, but Kyle stays behind, in doubt] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29401,Stan,"Kyle? [at the front of the synagogue, Kyle sits in the first pew right, and a shaft of moonlight shines down on him from the rose window over the altar. Stan approaches] Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29403,Stan,"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but-- "
5,6,Cartmanland,29405,Stan,"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29409,Stan,"[on the sofa] Oh, hey, dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29411,Stan,What's that? 
5,6,Cartmanland,29413,Stan,"Heh, heh. [Kyle glares at him] Sorry. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29415,Stan,"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29418,Stan,"[hops off the sofa and heads for the door] That does it, dude! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29420,Stan,We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! [Kyle hops off and takes his seat ring. Both boys leave] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29428,Stan,"Come on, dude! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29431,Stan,"Aw, crap. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29433,Stan,Dude! [rushes out of the park to Kyle] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29435,Stan,"Alright, let's go. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29437,Stan,"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29439,Stan,You'll see! We'll get in! [walks off with Kyle as Cartman glares after them.] 
5,6,Cartmanland,29460,Stan,"Dude, are you okay? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29462,Stan,"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in. "
5,6,Cartmanland,29464,Stan,Jesus. 
5,6,Cartmanland,29499,Stan,"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29501,Stan,"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29504,Stan,"AGGH! [The guard escorts him away] This isn't over, Cartman! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29595,Stan,"Kyle, you gotta see!! [the doctor looks at him. Sheila and Gerald turn around] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29597,Stan,"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached? "
5,6,Cartmanland,29599,Stan,"Then damnit man, do it! "
5,6,Cartmanland,29602,Stan,"Look, Kyle. Look. [smiles] "
5,6,Cartmanland,29609,Stan,Kyle! 
5,6,Cartmanland,29615,Stan,"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable. [a shot of Cartman on his knees, sobbing] Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29619,Stan,"[voice only] ""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"" "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29621,Stan,"[face appears] ""That's what you said last time [pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket], but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"" [moves the magnifying glass over the doll's body and fixes it there, focusing the sun's rays into a point] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29623,Stan,"""Scream for me, bitch!"" "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29627,Stan,"Oh no, what now? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29633,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29638,Stan,"Whoa, cool! [the dog quickly stands up and walks off] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29641,Stan,['I had no idea dogs made milk do it again. ']

5,7,Proper Condom Use,29651,Stan,But it's super-cool! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29655,Stan,"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29657,Stan,"[his parents turn at the sound of his voice] Red rocket, red rocket! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29660,Stan,"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. [the other adults turn away or show shocked looks] "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29662,Stan,My room? Why? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29666,Stan,No! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29668,Stan,Why?! What's the big deal?! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29670,Stan,"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29672,Stan,Huh?? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29675,Stan,What things?? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29677,Stan,No! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29693,Stan,"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29711,Stan,It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.

5,7,Proper Condom Use,29739,Stan,"[moves towards Wendy] But Wendy, we don't understand how that- "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29743,Stan,"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29747,Stan,"Yeah, we need condoms! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29751,Stan,Why does that matter? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29762,Stan,"Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29796,Stan,Doesn't it give any other directions? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29806,Stan,"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo! "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29812,Stan,How do you feel? 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29816,Stan,"Alright, here, everybody. [begins to move from his end to the other, visiting each of the boys] Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29845,Stan,"Man, this condom's driving me crazy. "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29853,Stan,From sex??

5,7,Proper Condom Use,29880,Stan,Ha! They're your diseases! 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29890,Stan,That does it! Attack! [the boys rush the stronghold] 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29937,Stan,We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases. 
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29949,Stan,"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex? "
5,7,Proper Condom Use,29957,Stan,"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy? "
5,8,Towelie,29964,Stan,"HA, I blew your head off! "
5,8,Towelie,29966,Stan,"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom? "
5,8,Towelie,29969,Stan,"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet. "
5,8,Towelie,29971,Stan,"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game! "
5,8,Towelie,29976,Stan,"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom. "
5,8,Towelie,29984,Stan,"[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom? "
5,8,Towelie,29987,Stan,The 2001 Okama GameSphere? 
5,8,Towelie,29992,Stan,"There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console] "
5,8,Towelie,29994,Stan,What's that? 
5,8,Towelie,29997,Stan,"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday! "
5,8,Towelie,30000,Stan,What? 
5,8,Towelie,30002,Stan,"Dude, we got GameSphere. "

5,8,Towelie,30007,Stan,...O-kay. 
5,8,Towelie,30010,Stan,"No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away] "
5,8,Towelie,30025,Stan,"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere. "
5,8,Towelie,30035,Stan,"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit! "
5,8,Towelie,30037,Stan,"Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball. "
5,8,Towelie,30041,Stan,"Okay, we will. "
5,8,Towelie,30046,Stan,"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it! "
5,8,Towelie,30050,Stan,"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer. "
5,8,Towelie,30053,Stan,"Oh, uh, I'm sick. "
5,8,Towelie,30056,Stan,But Mom... 
5,8,Towelie,30060,Stan,Can't believe we have to go to school! 
5,8,Towelie,30062,Stan,We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it] 
5,8,Towelie,30064,Stan,Fine. 
5,8,Towelie,30069,Stan,This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.] 
5,8,Towelie,30071,Stan,That was the longest day of school ever! 
5,8,Towelie,30075,Stan,It... it was right here. 
5,8,Towelie,30078,Stan,Hello?

5,8,Towelie,30084,Stan,They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere. 
5,8,Towelie,30088,Stan,Towelie! 
5,8,Towelie,30092,Stan,"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him. "
5,8,Towelie,30096,Stan,This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him. 
5,8,Towelie,30098,Stan,"Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing! "
5,8,Towelie,30102,Stan,"Come on, dude! [the others follow] "
5,8,Towelie,30108,Stan,They said the gas station outside of town. 
5,8,Towelie,30111,Stan,Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same] 
5,8,Towelie,30116,Stan,"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games. "
5,8,Towelie,30120,Stan,You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back. 
5,8,Towelie,30123,Stan,"Goddamnit, what now?! "
5,8,Towelie,30125,Stan,"[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away] "
5,8,Towelie,30129,Stan,[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere? 
5,8,Towelie,30132,Stan,"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie? "
5,8,Towelie,30134,Stan,"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements] "
5,8,Towelie,30145,Stan,"A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal] "
5,8,Towelie,30152,Stan,"Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window] "
5,8,Towelie,30155,Stan,"[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is? "
5,8,Towelie,30157,Stan,"Alright, so where is it? "
5,8,Towelie,30161,Stan,"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you! "
5,8,Towelie,30185,Stan,What? 
5,8,Towelie,30189,Stan,"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is? "
5,8,Towelie,30192,Stan,We don't care. 
5,8,Towelie,30194,Stan,"Dude, we don't care. "
5,8,Towelie,30196,Stan,We... don't... care. 
5,8,Towelie,30201,Stan,"[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care. "
5,8,Towelie,30205,Stan,"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please? "
5,8,Towelie,30223,Stan,"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf? "
5,8,Towelie,30225,Stan,Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter] 
5,8,Towelie,30228,Stan,What? 
5,8,Towelie,30230,Stan,"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school? "
5,8,Towelie,30232,Stan,"[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute! "
5,8,Towelie,30236,Stan,"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks. "
5,8,Towelie,30244,Stan,"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.] "
5,8,Towelie,30248,Stan,"No, Towelie, the entry code! "
5,8,Towelie,30250,Stan,"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence. "
5,8,Towelie,30259,Stan,Do you have our Okama GameSphere? 
5,8,Towelie,30261,Stan,"Oh God, don't care, don't care. "
5,8,Towelie,30270,Stan,So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp. 
5,8,Towelie,30275,Stan,But we don't care! 
5,8,Towelie,30284,Stan,We're just going in to get our video game back. 
5,8,Towelie,30288,Stan,"Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters] "
5,8,Towelie,30297,Stan,"Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it] "
5,8,Towelie,30299,Stan,"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play] "
5,8,Towelie,30305,Stan,"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny! "
5,8,Towelie,30320,Stan,"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere] "
5,8,Towelie,30328,Stan,"[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap! "

5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30471,Stan,"[peeks out] Okay, it's clear. Come on! [moves out with the goat and the other boys. A shadow falls across them] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30486,Stan,"Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30488,Stan,"[turns right and walks off] Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30493,Stan,"'K, let's put him on here. [walks up the ramp, pushing the goat along] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30495,Stan,"[enters and soothes the goat] Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30504,Stan,"Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30513,Stan,Twenty hours! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30523,Stan,"[finds the goat next to Kenny] Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home! [pulls out the return address] We have to find this address. [leads the goat off. The other boys follow] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30528,Stan,"Hey look! There's a taxi! [horse-drawn, with small back tires. The boys head for it, passing a street performer.] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30530,Stan,"[to the driver] Hello. We need to go... [hands the driver the address] here. [the driver says: شما می‌خواین برین خونه؟ ""You guys wanna go home?"" and whips the horse into action. The taxi moves off] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30534,Stan,I think so. [steps up and knocks on the door] 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30536,Stan,"A-ah, hi. We're from America. [Akmarh simply looks back] Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat? "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30539,Stan,Here. Wu-we don't want it. 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30541,Stan,"No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30543,Stan,"Oh uh, and here. [pulls out a small flag] Take this American flag as... a gift. [hands it to Akmarh and backs up. Akmarh considers the gift for a few moments, then throws it on the ground and steps back. The fat kid moves up and pours some fuel on it, then the poor kid strikes a match and throws it on the fuel, setting the flag on fire.] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30546,Stan,"Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30553,Stan,"Hey! Hey, open the door! "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30557,Stan,How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30560,Stan,"Alright. [leads the others away. The goat follows. Stan hears the hoofbeats and stops] Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30562,Stan,"What? [voices rise in the distance (مرگ بر آمریکا! مرگ بر آمریکا ""Down with USA"" or ""Death to America""! The boys look on. The protesters march by the boys and stop, curious about the boys standing there. Stan greets them] Howdy. [the protesters remain motionless] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30565,Stan,"[buries his face in his hand in disgust and shakes it] Cartman, you stupid asshole! [the crowd roars with anger and ties the four boys and the goat up. Two of the protesters talk about what to do next. One of them ends with] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30570,Stan,You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! [one of the guards says something] 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30580,Stan,"Dude, these people are insane. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30608,Stan,"Hey, what are you guys doing here? "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30629,Stan,"Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30646,Stan,But why? Why does a third of the world hate us? 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30648,Stan,[considers the argument...] ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes! 
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30659,Stan,"...He's got us there, dude. [pan out to see more fighting] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30677,Stan,"Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing. [the Afghan boys turn around] Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30680,Stan,"Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30695,Stan,"Come on, let's go get to the plane. [turns left and walks away. The others follow. On the way there, Stan sees a flag on the ground and approaches it. He goes down on one knee, picks up the little flag, blows the dust off it, sets it into the ground, takes off his jacket, and wraps it around the base of the flag ] "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30697,Stan,"No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30699,Stan,"[rises, steps back, and salutes] Go America. "
5,9,Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants,30701,Stan,"[follows] Yeah, go Broncos. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30705,Stan,[reaches for his hat and puts it on] I didn't smile. [hops off the stool and walks away. A wider view shows Ms. Choksondik's class in line off to the right. The kids move forward. Butters heads for the stool] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30709,Stan,[joins Kyle at the end of the line] Did you go yet? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30776,Stan,What's he want? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30781,Stan,"Goddamnit Cartman, what?! [Cartman hands him the carton and erupts in laughter as Stan and Kyle look it over] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30784,Stan,"That isn't funny, Cartman. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30816,Stan,"...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30823,Stan,"No way! [Cartman turns around and looks again, frowning] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30826,Stan,"Cartman, where are you going?? [Cartman keeps walking. The Thompsons simply shrug their shoulders, looking at each other] "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30829,Stan,Oh boy. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30831,Stan,Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30838,Stan,"Yeah, you missed them turning around. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30840,Stan,What? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30846,Stan,"Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30848,Stan,How the hell should we know? [the kids stop before a house] 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30852,Stan,There's these two people with asses where their heads should be. 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30854,Stan,"But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,30986,Stan,Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31014,Stan,"Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck! "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31023,Stan,"[noticing] Hey, you're laughing, Cartman. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31028,Stan,Huh? 
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31030,Stan,"Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31036,Stan," Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them. "
5,10,How to Eat with Your Butt,31038,Stan,"Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here. "
5,11,The Entity,31133,Stan,Hey dude. 
5,11,The Entity,31155,Stan,What the hell was that? 
5,11,The Entity,31247,Stan,"I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass. "
5,11,The Entity,31249,Stan,"Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype. "
5,11,The Entity,31253,Stan,"Book. Later, dude. [leaves the desk, walks to the door and around Kyle, and exits. Kyle Two gets out his own writing book and starts writing. Kyle's breathing can be heard, and Kyle Two stops. Kyle eats a bit of cracker and Kyle Two resumes writing. After a while he grimaces, then buries his face in his arms] "
5,11,The Entity,31323,Stan,"Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is. "
5,11,The Entity,31343,Stan,Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. [he and Kyle watch the plane lift off] 
5,11,The Entity,31368,Stan,"So dude, did Cartman's idea work? "
5,11,The Entity,31370,Stan,Damn! 
5,11,The Entity,31379,Stan,"Yeah, haha. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31422,Stan,"Your family is rich, dude. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31427,Stan,"Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31465,Stan,"Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie? "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31469,Stan,"[gets up and walks over to Tolkien] Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. [stops next to Tolkien] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31471,Stan,[looks at the disk] What's that? 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31473,Stan,DVD? We don't own a DVD player. 
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31481,Stan,"Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. [heads for the door] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31614,Stan,"I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31620,Stan,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! [leaves Kyle and kicks Cartman in the nuts. When he turns around Kenny kicks him in the nuts.] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31729,Stan,"Oh hey, there's Token. [Tolkien approaches them from the opposite direction] "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31731,Stan,"Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play? "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31733,Stan,"Sure, dude, you're our friend. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31735,Stan,"Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31738,Stan,"Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31742,Stan,"Yeah, I get it for that. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31752,Stan,"Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore. "
5,12,Here Comes the Neighborhood,31755,Stan,"[walks past Tolkien] Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31794,Stan,Well that burned a long time. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31796,Stan,"[all three rush to the new dung] Oh dude, there goes one. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31803,Stan,"What, Butters? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31805,Stan,Tell him we're busy. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31809,Stan,"Alright, let's go see what he wants. [the boys turn right and leave. Butters stays behind and looks at the melted turds. He approaches, squats, and sticks his finger in it] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31814,Stan,What? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31818,Stan,A boat? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31822,Stan,"Well WHAT, Cartman? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31826,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31831,Stan,Stem cells? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31855,Stan,"Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31858,Stan,"The principal? Aw, come on! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31864,Stan,Wait. What's going on here? [he and Kyle back up a bit. Their parents join them] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31868,Stan,Well how sick? 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31870,Stan,"[after a pause] ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31872,Stan,"Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31877,Stan,[tearing up] ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31879,Stan,No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! [buries his face in Randy's arm and begins sobbing] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31899,Stan,[looks up at Kyle] Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die! 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31915,Stan,"[finds his voice] I- [looks at Kenny, then at Kyle, then at Kenny, and rushes out the door] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31918,Stan,"I can't, I just can't. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31920,Stan,"[turns around] I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31922,Stan,"And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT! "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31924,Stan,[turns around and walks away] Just leave me alone! 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31926,Stan,"[turns once more, with tears in his eyes] I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! [turns and leaves. Kyle turns to go back to the hospital, but sighs silently] "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31990,Stan,Hey Chef. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31992,Stan,Bad. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,31994,Stan,"Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31996,Stan,"But then, why does God give us anything to start with? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,31998,Stan,I think I understand. 
5,13,Kenny Dies,32019,Stan,"Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32024,Stan,"Hey, Kenny! [grins, then is stunned. The room is empty. Kenny is gone. Due to terminal illness.] Oh no. [Kyle walks up to the room, but stays outside] No. "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32026,Stan,"But... [a shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye. [another shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] Did he say anything before he went? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32030,Stan,I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. [the doors fly open and Cartman walks in. He sees his friends and they look back.] 
5,13,Kenny Dies,32035,Stan,"What, Cartman? What's happened? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32037,Stan,"This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses? "
5,13,Kenny Dies,32043,Stan,"Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend! [Kyle gives Cartman a good roundhouse right and Cartman falls on the ground, face first.] Cartman was! [Kyle continues beating Cartman up] "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32342,Stan,Butters was missing? 
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32352,Stan,"Damn, dude. "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32357,Stan,"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you. "
5,14,Butters' Very Own Episode,32361,Stan,Really? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32376,Stan,"Oh, dude, look! [the others look up and the phone falls off Cartman's lap to the floor] It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches! "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32381,Stan,Hey Kenny. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32388,Stan,"We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! [Stan and Kyle hop off the sofa and head for the front door] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32407,Stan,What kind of help? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32411,Stan,I'll bet you can. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32426,Stan,"Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32430,Stan,[following] Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32440,Stan,"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32446,Stan,"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... His name is Butters, it's Butters. [the boys begin to sway for each line]  "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32449,Stan,"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32474,Stan,Marry him? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32483,Stan,"[notices] Chef, we need more food. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32486,Stan,"[soberly] Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32514,Stan,"How do you feel, Butters? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32517,Stan,"Alright, now it's time for phase 2. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32525,Stan,"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32557,Stan,Did you bring the camera? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32562,Stan,That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32567,Stan,Butters?! What the hell are you doing?! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32573,Stan,[Kyle finally produces the camera] Did you eat only one ounce of City Wok like we told you?! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32577,Stan,All prepared for liposuction surgery? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32580,Stan,"[shoots back] Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. [Cartman makes sure the scalpel is sharp] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32596,Stan,"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32598,Stan,We've gotta hurry this up. [moves behind the coffee table to Butter's belly and starts pounding on it. The fat begins flowing out faster] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32600,Stan,He's losing weight. [Kyle smiles] 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32604,Stan,"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32606,Stan,"Dude, bail! [the three boys rush out the back door, then the front door opens and Butter's parents walk in. The living room is a mess] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32628,Stan,"Come on, Butters. Time to go. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32632,Stan,What? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32636,Stan,...Kenny would have done it. 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32644,Stan,"Alright, it's settled. Come on, Butters. [pulls Butters out the door. Cartman enters the house] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32666,Stan,That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32670,Stan,What?! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32672,Stan,Wait. Everyone hates Jared now? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32674,Stan,"Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. [the boys exit the store] "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32692,Stan,"No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS,"" AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides. "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32719,Stan,"Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials? "
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32721,Stan,Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32723,Stan,[takes off his hat and throws it on the ground] Oh God-damnit! 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32726,Stan,Why? 
6,1,Jared Has Aides,32728,Stan,"Well, so much for our money. "
6,2,Asspen,32763,Stan,He's such a douchebag. 
6,2,Asspen,32765,Stan,"[watches as Cartman climbs the sofa] Yeah, and then what? "
6,2,Asspen,32787,Stan,They're still asleep. 
6,2,Asspen,32797,Stan,What's a Hitler? 
6,2,Asspen,32799,Stan,"No, I never have. "
6,2,Asspen,32812,Stan,Smell what? 
6,2,Asspen,32855,Stan,"Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess. "
6,2,Asspen,32857,Stan,Uhh... no. 
6,2,Asspen,32859,Stan,Stan. Marsh. 
6,2,Asspen,32863,Stan,"Dude, I'm just learning. "
6,2,Asspen,32865,Stan,I never said I was. 
6,2,Asspen,32894,Stan,...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza... 
6,2,Asspen,32896,Stan,Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own. 
6,2,Asspen,32898,Stan,[winces and covers his face with his right hand] Oh no. 
6,2,Asspen,32900,Stan,Heather? [a woman skis up and stands next to the skier] 
6,2,Asspen,32904,Stan,[just looks at them] ...who are you people?! 
6,2,Asspen,32906,Stan,"All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone? "
6,2,Asspen,32909,Stan,Okay. 
6,2,Asspen,32914,Stan,"Yeah, prob'ly. "
6,2,Asspen,32916,Stan,Fries... fries... 
6,2,Asspen,32920,Stan,"[drops his poles] Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. [a group of young adults walk by carrying Tad high in the air. The group stops, the boys turn around to see] "
6,2,Asspen,32923,Stan,Thanks. Who are you? 
6,2,Asspen,32946,Stan,It seems fine. 
6,2,Asspen,32949,Stan,Don't care. [the boys go further onto the dance floor] 
6,2,Asspen,32951,Stan,I dunno. 
6,2,Asspen,32956,Stan,"Oh,. God. [buries his face in his hand again.] "
6,2,Asspen,32959,Stan,"Gah, let's go you guys. [turns around and leads the others towards the door...] "
6,2,Asspen,32961,Stan,"Dude, what the hell is your problem?! "

6,2,Asspen,32987,Stan,"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to! "
6,2,Asspen,33008,Stan,"[approaches] Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13. "
6,2,Asspen,33010,Stan,"I have to do this, okay? I have to! "
6,2,Asspen,33036,Stan,Pizza... pizza... pizza... 
6,2,Asspen,33050,Stan,Thanks. [Tad reaches the finish line to see the celebration start without him. He takes off his goggles and throws them to the ground in anger] 
6,2,Asspen,33058,Stan,Where the hell have you guys been?! 
6,2,Asspen,33063,Stan,No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! [turns right and leads the other boys away] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33072,Stan,"Hm, that sounds pretty good. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33074,Stan,Hey Kenny! [the three boys grin] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33080,Stan,"Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povich freak show is on. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33106,Stan,Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33111,Stan,What disease should we say? 
6,3,Freak Strike,33113,Stan,[drops his hands] What? [the others follow] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33118,Stan,This is gonna be so funny! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33124,Stan,"We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33130,Stan,"It has to be you, Butters. Think about it. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33135,Stan,[looks away and up] Kenny woulda done it. [Butters reacts] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33139,Stan,"[begins to walk and lead the others away] Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. [Butters now looks chastened] "
6,3,Freak Strike,33145,Stan,Where's you get the balls from? 
6,3,Freak Strike,33149,Stan,Wow! 
6,3,Freak Strike,33154,Stan,"All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I "
6,3,Freak Strike,33164,Stan,"That's your flight, Butters. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33167,Stan,"Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33171,Stan,Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! [pause] 
6,3,Freak Strike,33213,Stan,Here he comes. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33246,Stan,"But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't! "
6,3,Freak Strike,33283,Stan,"[on the other end] Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you? "
6,3,Freak Strike,33285,Stan,"Yeah, they wanted to find you bad. "
6,3,Freak Strike,33287,Stan,I- told them where to find you. 
6,3,Freak Strike,33289,Stan,"Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. [hangs up. Butters looks helpless, then walks to the window to see if the freaks are coming. They are indeed] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33448,Stan,Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows?? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33452,Stan,"Yeah, I wouldn't have. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33459,Stan,"Tomorrow morning? [a shot of the calves has Stan, Kyle, and Butters transfixed. The rest of the class leaves] Dude, we gotta help them. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33462,Stan,"[knocks twice on the wall below the window] Pst, Cartman. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33464,Stan,"[knocks twice while saying] Cartman, wake up! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33468,Stan,"We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33472,Stan,"So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33474,Stan,"We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33476,Stan,"[heaves softly] Damnit Butters, will you shut up?! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33478,Stan,[plainly] Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33484,Stan,"Go on, dude it's the only way. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33487,Stan,"Just do it really fast, and we can go. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33493,Stan,"Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33499,Stan,"Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too! [holds up parts of a torch] How does this thing work, Cartman? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33502,Stan,"[softly into his headset] Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33504,Stan,"[looks up and calls out] I said that's far enough! [the harness drops to the floor. He gets up and unlocks himself out of the harness, and it goes back up. A calf looks back at him innocently. Stan moves up behind the calf, the softly] Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose. [removes the chain] There you go. You're free. Run away! [the calf doesn't move, and Stan gestures] Go! They're gonna murder you. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33509,Stan,"Come on, you stupid baby cows! [walks towards the door and lifts up the security bar, then opens the door] You have to get out of here. [they just lift their heads and look at the entrance. The other boys join Stan inside the veal ranch] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33511,Stan,They aren't leaving. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33514,Stan,"Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. [a shot of the calves again] Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33516,Stan,"Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33518,Stan,I don't know. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33522,Stan,"[moves towards the calves] We're just gonna have to carry them one by one. [lifts up his first calf] Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Butters look at each other, then move to join Stan] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33528,Stan,We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33531,Stan,Butters! [Butters turns] Did you bring it? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33535,Stan,What? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33547,Stan,Aw crap! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33549,Stan,[points an accusing finger at Rancher Bob and approaches] That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33551,Stan,"They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33554,Stan,No! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33556,Stan,You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer! [walks off to his right] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33558,Stan,[pushing his dresser into place against the door] Kiss my ass! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33569,Stan,"I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33572,Stan,"[serious] Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33574,Stan,"[glares] Shut up, Cartman. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33577,Stan,Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33593,Stan,"Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33603,Stan,"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until we know the calves will be safe. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33609,Stan,[sighs] Round one is over. We made it. [the boys gather in] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33611,Stan,"Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33613,Stan,Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33615,Stan,"We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! [one calf takes a dump on the carpet, another walks up and takes a piss on it] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33632,Stan,"No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33636,Stan,"Wait, what is that? [points to the basket. The other three boys turn. Cartman approaches the window and takes the basket] Dude! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33644,Stan,See? Now we can hold out for weeks! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33647,Stan,"[sensing a lapse] Wha? [rises and walks to his bed, where the other boys sit eating] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33649,Stan,"Dude, what are you guys doing? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33651,Stan,You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33655,Stan,"[returns to his corner] That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33667,Stan,"No, this is exactly what we wanted. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33669,Stan,"Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people. "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33672,Stan,[the boys are stunned] ...I don't believe it. 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33675,Stan,[notices the situation] Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! [Butters stirs and turns around] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33681,Stan,What are they doing here? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33697,Stan,"Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. [lifts up his shirt to show the sores to the others] "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33700,Stan,No! 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33706,Stan,Hello? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33708,Stan,"Ah, hold on. [turns to the other boys] It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do? "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33710,Stan,What do I say?? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33720,Stan,"Cartman, no! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33740,Stan,O-ogh... 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33782,Stan,[looking very weak and with a few more sores on his body] It... did? 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33784,Stan,Pick me up. I... I want to see. [Kyle picks him up] 
6,4,Fun with Veal,33828,Stan,"We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried! "
6,4,Fun with Veal,33845,Stan,"Well, I guess we learned something today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33855,Stan,[pouring chips into a bowl] This is gonna be so awesome! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33857,Stan,"Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anything! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33863,Stan,"Alright, here we go. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33869,Stan,"Shelly, we're watching that! Go back! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33871,Stan,"[rushes up to her] No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! [she switches back to HBC] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33876,Stan,"It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33879,Stan,But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33887,Stan,"But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33889,Stan,"Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33891,Stan,"[glances down, then answers] O-K, deal. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33896,Stan,"[somber] Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33898,Stan,"Dude, I'm not going. "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33900,Stan,Stan. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33917,Stan,"Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up? "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33920,Stan,They look fine to me. [another shot of Russell sailing away] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33925,Stan,That's worse! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33927,Stan,Dude! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33930,Stan,"Dude, the commercials could start any time! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33933,Stan,Get all the stuff! [they gather the snacks and head for the front door. Cartman opens the door and Butters arrives] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33935,Stan,We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! [the three boys exit] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33939,Stan,Hurry! We can't miss the commercials! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33943,Stan,"Huff, huff "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33961,Stan,Aww! [the boys gather their snacks and head for the door] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33965,Stan,"AGH! [thinks hard, then] Wait! Chef just got a new plasma screen TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! [they leave. Ike goes back to the sofa and sits, changing the channel] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33977,Stan,"[impatient] Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels? "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33982,Stan,We made it! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33987,Stan,Here they come! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,33992,Stan,I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34004,Stan,"Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. [looks like Russell is fighting Germans, but the menu windows block the view] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34009,Stan,Oh God-dammit! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34012,Stan,"Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! [the four get off the sofa and head out the door. A car screeches to a halt, and the TV fires at the driver, forcing the couple inside to flee] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34015,Stan,The bar! They've got a TV at the bar! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34020,Stan,We made it. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34037,Stan,But we have to watch the commercials in this show. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34043,Stan,"[the first to head for the door] Come on, we gotta get to a TV! [the others follow] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34078,Stan,Commercial Break Number Two! [the boys are positively giddy with anticipation] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34082,Stan,I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break. 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34109,Stan,"Oh, God, it's horrible! [the boys leave and exit the community] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34113,Stan,We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34116,Stan,"Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34120,Stan,Turn it on! Turn it on! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34129,Stan,Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34131,Stan,She has to! [leads the boys out of Cartman's house] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34133,Stan,Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute! 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34138,Stan,What? 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34146,Stan,"The last commercial break has to be coming any second! [two phaser blasts are seen. One kills the bearded crack addict, another knocks a trash can over. Chef's TV appears and the two remaining addicts and the boys scream] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34152,Stan,"We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house?? "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34159,Stan,"Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! [they run off] "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34165,Stan,We made it! [grins] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34169,Stan,"Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be?? "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34174,Stan,"Wait a minute! Look! [points and reads from the TV] ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34180,Stan,That looks AWEsome! [Cartman goes to the phone and starting dialing a number] 
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34185,Stan,"Oh, dude, let's go! "
6,5,The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer,34189,Stan,I wonder if it's all a western? 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34201,Stan,"[turns to the boys] Okay, here he comes. [join Cartman and Kyle] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34217,Stan,"Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34228,Stan,"All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34246,Stan,[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends. [cut to Stan seated on a green sofa under a spotlight] It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34261,Stan,[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34278,Stan,"All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny. [the camera pans over the remaining candidates] Good luck. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34289,Stan,"Okay, next? [signals for Craig to leave. Craig walks away and Tolkien comes in to take his place. Scene music plays. A few moments for the boys to get a feel for Tolkien] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34291,Stan,"Yeah, it's not bad. Next? [Signals for Tolkien to leave. Tolkien walks away and Timmy rides in to take his place. Scene music plays.] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34325,Stan,"Shut up, fatass! [silence. They look at Craig and the anger fades from their faces as they wait for him to respond] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34377,Stan,I like it. [takes notes] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34389,Stan,"Okay, let's try this. [a shot of the field. The Jumbotron at center field loses focus and glimpses of Professor Chaos are seen] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34404,Stan,"Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? [holds up Towelie's picture] "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34407,Stan,"[weary] Oh, this is giving me a headache. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34409,Stan,"[acquiescing] You're right. Well now, how about Timmy? [holds up Timmy's picture] He's quiet and he takes direction well. Really the perfect friend. "
6,6,Professor Chaos,34411,Stan,How about Token? [holds up Tolkien's picture] 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34419,Stan,That's great. 
6,6,Professor Chaos,34423,Stan,Suckup. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34443,Stan,"Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. [Tweek moves forward, but then backs up. Stan rises and turns to Tweek] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34447,Stan,Just put it between its eyes. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34449,Stan,"Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time? "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34452,Stan,"[flatly] Oh, hey Butters. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34456,Stan,"Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34461,Stan,Uh oh. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34473,Stan,"Alright, I'll chip in. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34503,Stan,Ready. Let's see 'em. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34505,Stan,"Are they playing basketball? [Cartman picks up the box and looks at the front. A close-up of a sea couple. Cartman looks in the tank and sees just shrimp. He looks displeased, Kyle has the sign in hand again] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34507,Stan,"Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34512,Stan,What are we gonna do with them? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34515,Stan,"Yeah, that'd be funny. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34547,Stan,"Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34550,Stan,"Oh jeez, change the channel. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34552,Stan,"They found the sea men! It's only a matter of time before they find the women, too! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34555,Stan,We're dead! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34559,Stan,"Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are! "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34566,Stan,"Chef, we did something kind of bad. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34569,Stan,[pause] We need you to promise not to tell anybody. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34571,Stan,We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34573,Stan,"[beat] So what should we do? [Chef thinks, then goes and pushes the sofa towards the door and onto the entry path] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34585,Stan,This is it. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34589,Stan,"Yeah, stupid. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34592,Stan,"Dude, it's probably still in her stomach. [Kyle approaches the corpse in the middle of the room and pulls back the cover. Ms. Choksondik's chest and abdomen have been cut open right down the front] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34595,Stan,What do we do now? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34598,Stan,Do you see the sea people. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34602,Stan,Yeah. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34604,Stan,Aaah! 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34611,Stan,"Let's go! [He, Kyle, and Tweek head out the door quickly. Cartman pops out of Ms. Choksondik's corpse gasping for air] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34625,Stan,The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34628,Stan,...and then we put them back in the tank. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34637,Stan,"[turns and waves to Cartman] Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. [turns and exits. Kyle follows] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34643,Stan,"Oh no, what now? [the boys turn left and follow] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34647,Stan,How? How did that happen? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34650,Stan,They've already accomplished so much. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34697,Stan,"Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34701,Stan,"Well, drop them in! [Tweek opens the packets and drops the contents in] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34705,Stan,That's cool. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34707,Stan,"[hands Cartman the smaller tank] Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. [Cartman takes the tank and turns it over, pouring the sea ciety into the larger tank. Screams are heard from the sea people] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34709,Stan,...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose? 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34711,Stan,Hm. 
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34720,Stan,"Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34735,Stan,"Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything. "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34742,Stan,"Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! [the others turn around to see. Shown is a statue of Tweek in progress] "
6,7,The Simpsons Already Did It,34751,Stan,The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34758,Stan,That sounds pretty fun. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34768,Stan,What are they talking about? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34786,Stan,"Um, cool. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34792,Stan,...Like ...money? What? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34809,Stan,What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? [silence. Only birds are heard] 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34815,Stan,"We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest ever put anything in our butts. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34819,Stan,We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34823,Stan,Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34828,Stan,What? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34875,Stan,Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34879,Stan,"You've had five, dude! "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34910,Stan,"Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34912,Stan,What? He did. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34914,Stan,Yeah it does. 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34916,Stan,"[firmly] Yeah. It does. [Randy looks at him angrily, then wonders if it could be...] "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34941,Stan,So? 
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,34948,Stan,"Dude, look. "
6,8,Red Hot Catholic Love,35023,Stan,Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again? 
6,9,Free Hat,35026,Stan,"Oh, cool. A preview. [the curtain goes up and the preview, for a PG-rated film, airs] "
6,9,Free Hat,35028,Stan,"Aw, dude, why would they do that? "
6,9,Free Hat,35031,Stan,That's gay. [next trailer airs. No rating seen] 
6,9,Free Hat,35033,Stan,Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies? 
6,9,Free Hat,35039,Stan,"Goddamnit, that pisses me off! "
6,9,Free Hat,35045,Stan,"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified! "
6,9,Free Hat,35047,Stan,We have to do something. Let's form a club. 
6,9,Free Hat,35049,Stan,"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with! "
6,9,Free Hat,35059,Stan,Well what's wrong with it? 
6,9,Free Hat,35068,Stan,"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. [walks off with Cartman and Kyle screen right] "
6,9,Free Hat,35084,Stan,What? 
6,9,Free Hat,35087,Stan,"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet. [turns and opens the door, then peeks in. The place is packed. All the bleachers are filled, and there are five rows of people standing on the gym floor. He backs out, closes the door, and turns to his friends] Dude, there's like a thousand people in there! "
6,9,Free Hat,35097,Stan,"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats. "
6,9,Free Hat,35099,Stan,"[takes the mic] Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause. "
6,9,Free Hat,35101,Stan,"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. [the cheering dies down and a voice pipes up] "
6,9,Free Hat,35107,Stan,"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause? "
6,9,Free Hat,35113,Stan,"Aaaah, [""Free Ha-""], okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? [the crowd stops moving] "
6,9,Free Hat,35118,Stan,"Waitwaitwaitwait! [the crowd stops] Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference! "
6,9,Free Hat,35120,Stan,"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat. "
6,9,Free Hat,35124,Stan,"...212, 213, 214 members! "
6,9,Free Hat,35128,Stan,Really? That's great. 
6,9,Free Hat,35131,Stan,"If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films. "
6,9,Free Hat,35135,Stan,When did we do dibs for it? 
6,9,Free Hat,35163,Stan,"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now? "
6,9,Free Hat,35175,Stan,"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark. [the crowd begins to murmur] There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? [hands the mic to Cartman, who moves over to an easel] "
6,9,Free Hat,35178,Stan,That is our understanding. 
6,9,Free Hat,35185,Stan,"It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies. "
6,9,Free Hat,35192,Stan,Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raiders. 
6,9,Free Hat,35195,Stan,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves. "
6,9,Free Hat,35203,Stan,"Okay, go. [the other boys, with their own flashlights, pour in] "
6,9,Free Hat,35208,Stan,"[finding the video library] Over here! [the other boys join him at the stacks. They see ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 300,"" ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 301,"" ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 302,"" etc., then ""First Day of School"" and ""First Day of School, Digitally Enhanced,"" then ""Wedding Video"" and ""Wedding Video, Digitally Enhanced."" The camera scans past ""Kids First Swimming Lesson"" and ""Kids First Swimming Lesson w/ Digitally Enhanced Weather"" to stop at the reel of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark, Original Negative 1982.""] "
6,9,Free Hat,35221,Stan,"Aw, really? "
6,9,Free Hat,35226,Stan,Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song. 
6,9,Free Hat,35229,Stan,"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song. "
6,9,Free Hat,35237,Stan,"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. [Lucas looks at them] "
6,9,Free Hat,35242,Stan,"[steps forward] You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours. "
6,9,Free Hat,35245,Stan,Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it. 
6,9,Free Hat,35257,Stan,"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! [the boys turn and make their way to the door] "
6,9,Free Hat,35301,Stan,He's definitely lost it. 
6,9,Free Hat,35315,Stan,"[pleading] You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it. "
6,9,Free Hat,35317,Stan,"[pleading] Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! [the boys quickly turn away, shut their eyes, and bow their heads] "
6,9,Free Hat,35325,Stan,"Yuh, you guys okay. [the others open their eyes. The ropes that bound them are gone] "
6,9,Free Hat,35338,Stan,"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys turn and walk off. Tweek can't help but look at the baby's fate] "
6,9,Free Hat,35342,Stan,"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world. "
6,9,Free Hat,35345,Stan,"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35349,Stan,"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35383,Stan,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35398,Stan,Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35402,Stan,"[arriving with a group of boys: Kyle, Cartman, Tolkien, Butters, Tweek, and Clyde] Ah, hey, Bebe. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35404,Stan,"Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35411,Stan,Hella fun. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35415,Stan,"Cool. [the boys turn as one and walk back the way they came] We'll see you later, Bebe. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35417,Stan,"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. [turns and walks off] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35421,Stan,"So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. [he throws a rock towards the road and the others look at the trajectory. A blue pick-up truck drives by and is hit] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35437,Stan,"[grabs the rock and demonstrates] Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now- "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35439,Stan,Hoh hoh hoh! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35443,Stan,"[beat] ...Wait, what were we doing again? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35455,Stan,"Hey, that's what I wrote about! "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35458,Stan,"[grunts and pounds his desk] Hah hah, hah! [the other boys start grunting like apes] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35474,Stan,That's such a great paper! [starts clapping. The other boys join in the applause] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35517,Stan,Yeah. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35521,Stan,Uh huh. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35524,Stan,That would be best. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35527,Stan,Kyle?? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35531,Stan,"Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out! "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35533,Stan,No! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35536,Stan,Yeah! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35540,Stan,"Sure thing, Bebe. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35562,Stan,"Yeah. [they arrive, but find four other boys arriving at the same time: Timmy, Kevin, Bradley, and Francis] Where are you guys going? "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35564,Stan,Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35567,Stan,[steps forward and grunts] Hoh! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35572,Stan,"Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. [goes and knocks on the door] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35578,Stan,Cartman's? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35604,Stan,[jumps in front of Boy 2] Hoh! [the other boys begin to grunt and face each other] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35614,Stan,"[atop a pile of boys] Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! [he's knocked them all out and tossed them into a mound] "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35618,Stan,"Hoh, hoh hoh hoh! "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35620,Stan,Hoh hoh hoh! [picks up his rock and plays with it] Hohohoh hoh! 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35628,Stan,Hoh. Hoh? 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35663,Stan,"[disheveled, in his primal state] Aaaa-ta. [starts drawing another boob. The wall is covered with them, singly or in pairs. One stick-figure woman has a large pair] Aaaa-ta. "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35665,Stan,[picks up a stick and moves it around] Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35668,Stan,"[points to the wall with his stick] Ahta. Ah, ahta! "
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35670,Stan,[turns to face his father] Hoh? Ahta. [points to the wall] Ahta. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35672,Stan,Ahta. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35674,Stan,Ahta? [Sharon walks behind Randy and sits on one of the sofa's arms] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35676,Stan,[considers each argument] Friends. Ahta. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35717,Stan,Ahta! [more grunts. Bebe enters wearing a cardboard box over her clothes. The boys quiet down.] 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35721,Stan,Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35724,Stan,Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions. 
6,10,Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society,35730,Stan,"I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35774,Stan,I hope this movie doesn't suck ass. 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35860,Stan,Child Tracker? 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35865,Stan,"...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker! "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35867,Stan,I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?! 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35879,Stan,Huh? 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35881,Stan,"But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35903,Stan,[mouth full] I'm not done with my pizza. 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35908,Stan,"Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35941,Stan,But why do I have to leave? 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35947,Stan,Where are we supposed to go? 
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35952,Stan,"Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35969,Stan,"Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. [the Mongolians laugh] "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35988,Stan,"[""Budu e noo""] Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. [squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his right hand] "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,35994,Stan,"Uh huh, Stan Marsh. "
6,11,Child Abduction is Not Funny,36014,Stan,"[to Kyle] Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. [faces forward and continues walking] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36017,Stan,We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36023,Stan,Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36027,Stan,Because our names were called on the commercial last night! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36030,Stan,We've gotta find that ticket! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36035,Stan,"[hands the stub to Cartman] You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36044,Stan,Where's Kenny?? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36049,Stan,"[shuts Cartman up quick and stumbles for words] Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36062,Stan,[climbs up to the window and looks in] Did you get it? [Kyle climbs up next to him] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36068,Stan,Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36072,Stan,I can't see. [Cartman pours out the ashes and the boys sneeze from the fine powder until it dissipates. Some ash smudges remain on their faces.] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36075,Stan,It was a trick! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36077,Stan,Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36080,Stan,We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! [gets off his stool and walks away.] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36086,Stan,"Cartman, come on! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36088,Stan,Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36093,Stan,"[going for some more wood] We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36095,Stan,Because we wanna see Kenny again. [heaves a piece of wood back to the tower] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36118,Stan,Mr. Garrison threw away his car? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36129,Stan,"Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36139,Stan,"Excuse me. [""Nahurabo""] Excuse me! [""Nahurabo""] Uh, we ran out of stuff. [the singing abruptly stops] We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36143,Stan,"We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36154,Stan,No. Hello?? Kenny?? God?? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36157,Stan,"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off. "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36161,Stan,What?? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36171,Stan,Hey Kenny. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36179,Stan,"Dude, what the hell is wrong with you?? "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36183,Stan,Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36206,Stan,"No, we have to see Kenny! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36208,Stan,Cremated? What's that? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36219,Stan,"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny! "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36226,Stan,"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! [leaves the table] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36242,Stan,Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! [the last few words echo a few times] 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36245,Stan,"[hands the stub to Cartman] Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. [the last few words echo a few times] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36264,Stan,Where?? 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36268,Stan,Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36270,Stan,Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?! 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36288,Stan,"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. [everyone turns to look at the boys] "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36295,Stan,"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels... "
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36304,Stan,Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body. 
6,12,A Ladder to Heaven,36308,Stan,"Dude, come back here! [chases after Cartman] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36319,Stan,O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin? 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36323,Stan,You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters? 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36327,Stan,"[reaches out and receives the tape] Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36335,Stan,How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog? 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36338,Stan,"Good job, wizard. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36364,Stan,My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36383,Stan,The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. [a few seconds later some headlights shine on them] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36388,Stan,We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36393,Stan,Woww. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36400,Stan,We have come to reclaim the one tape! [Butters sits up and Kyle goes for the tape] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36415,Stan,"[takes the tape from Kyle] No, we have to return it! [the boys turn to walk away again. Butters crawls a few inches] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36420,Stan,"Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36425,Stan,"Nothing. [the sixth grader rips the tape out of Stan's hand] Hey, kid! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36430,Stan,Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36434,Stan,There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36460,Stan,"Oh crap, dude! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36463,Stan,Ogh. [Cartman sighs silently] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36465,Stan,"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36488,Stan,We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36492,Stan,"Yes, but this is not a-- [stops, then reacts] Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. [hands the tape to Clyde] "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36512,Stan,"But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36523,Stan,"[steps forward] Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see? "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36527,Stan,What do we do with it? 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36539,Stan,I will take it! [the boys quiet down and Stan approaches the table. He takes the tape in hand. Cartman closes his eyes in meditation] I will walk to the video store. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36546,Stan,"No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember? "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36554,Stan,True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36574,Stan,Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36594,Stan,Jimmy didn't stop them! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36602,Stan,Just get across the river! They're coming! [the three remaining boys scramble across the river. The sixth graders arrive. Two of them stop their tires by performing wheelies and landing their bikes back on the road. The lead sixth grader rides up between them] 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36610,Stan,"Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36613,Stan,This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36617,Stan,Where?! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36621,Stan,"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36643,Stan,Closed? 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36647,Stan,"[seeing a way out of this mess] Wait. A drop box. [goes to it and pulls down the door] Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in! "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36652,Stan,They're coming! 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36666,Stan,Uh-oh. 
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36673,Stan,"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video. "
6,13,The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers,36682,Stan,...Wow. [another long moment of stunned silence] 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36736,Stan,"[coming to Cartman's defense] Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36752,Stan,"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36756,Stan,"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36758,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad- "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36784,Stan,"Yeah, I have to remember that. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36793,Stan,I guess. 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36813,Stan,"[sensing what's about to happen] Oh, no, no, no no no no. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36823,Stan,"Chef, we're intolerant. [beat] "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36827,Stan,"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around them. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36831,Stan,Are we homophobes now? 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36834,Stan,N-no? 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36864,Stan,We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos! 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36874,Stan,Tolerance camp? 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36920,Stan,"Kyle. [helps him up and tries to rouse him] Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures. "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36922,Stan,"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you! "
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36924,Stan,Butters! 
6,14,The Death Camp of Tolerance,36926,Stan,"Jesus... we have to get out of here. [other kids are passed out, some on their backs, some on their stomachs] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37015,Stan,"Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37018,Stan,"Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37028,Stan,"No, that's Kenny. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37030,Stan,That's Cartman. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37039,Stan,"Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37048,Stan,Awesome! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37066,Stan,"Uh, over here please? "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37073,Stan,We told you that. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37079,Stan,"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37089,Stan,Heh hey wait a minute dude. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37096,Stan,He seemed better on TV? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37099,Stan,"[approaches Kyle] Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? [Cartman has a seizure; the other boys look over. Cartman goes silent, and he's shown standing unconscious.] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37104,Stan,We don't get to go to Scotland? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37106,Stan,"[to Cartman] Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37110,Stan,[moving off slowly] That's us. Come on. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37112,Stan,Huh? 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37114,Stan,"Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37116,Stan,"Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. [walks off] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37118,Stan,"[stops and looks at Kyle, astonished] What?? "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37120,Stan,"Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! [slaps his left palm on his face] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37122,Stan,"Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37124,Stan,"I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37128,Stan,Jesus Christ. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37132,Stan,"Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37134,Stan,"Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37136,Stan,"Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37138,Stan,"Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37140,Stan,"No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37142,Stan,"No dude, you're a douche. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37144,Stan,Then you're a stupid douche. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37146,Stan,I'm nine years old. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37148,Stan,"You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche! [walks towards the door, but notices some books on a bookcase nearby. He checks them out. ""How To Be A Psychic"" ""Cold Reading: The Trick Of The Psychic!"" ""Make Women Believe You're Psychic! Then Have Sex With Them!"" ""How To Sixty Nine With Yourself"" ...Stan senses the real reason behind John's efforts] Son of a bitch. [takes the books and leaves the estate.] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37163,Stan,Kyle! Kyle! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37165,Stan,"Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37167,Stan,"Kyle, you can't run your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37169,Stan,"No, he's not. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37173,Stan,"[looks around at the adults, then] Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you? "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37175,Stan,"Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay? "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37177,Stan,"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37179,Stan,"Does this month, November, hold a special significance? "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37181,Stan,"Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"" "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37183,Stan,"See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37185,Stan,"I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday."" "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37187,Stan,"Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He's saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money."" "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37190,Stan,"No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37194,Stan,What?! [his deconstruction didn't work. The adults crowd in] 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37197,Stan,No wait. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37231,Stan,"Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully. [the applause dies down] This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? [puts his hand to his temple] They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37234,Stan,"No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?"" "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37238,Stan,[getting annoyed] Stop it! I didn't do anything! 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37240,Stan,"[reminding] I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely."" "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37245,Stan,"[frustrated, with right hand over his clenched eyelids] Okay. Let's back up. [each audience row backs up to the one behind it] Not literally! "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37266,Stan,"Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37268,Stan,"Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! [throws the stack away and leaves. He reaches the front doors, opens them, and is face-to-face with John Edward] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37270,Stan,"No, I don't think either one of us can. [Kyle gets up from his seat and leaves the room] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37272,Stan,"I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever! "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37274,Stan,"Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche! "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37276,Stan,"Fine, douche! [slams one door on him...] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37301,Stan,"No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37303,Stan,"You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all  just stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole? [the audience is listening] We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. [more audience listening, reflection. Kyle is present. One man claps, then others clap with him, then murmurs are heard] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37306,Stan,Yeah. 
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37308,Stan,"There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37316,Stan,"No, it can't be. "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37321,Stan,"Oh, dude! [smiles] "
6,15,The Biggest Douche in the Universe,37324,Stan,Now do you people believe me? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37353,Stan,[arriving] What's going on? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37355,Stan,So throw it away. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37360,Stan,"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37365,Stan,[annoyed at his friends' skittishness] It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37367,Stan,"Fine, I will. [takes the bag and walks over to the stump, faces the boys, and tosses the joint into the bag] There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37372,Stan,"Aw, come on, Mom. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37374,Stan,"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37383,Stan,"[rises from the sofa and walks over] Who the fuck is it, Mom and Dad? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37385,Stan,I'm me from the past? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37397,Stan,"Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37404,Stan,What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! [squeezes his eyes shut and buries them in his right hand] 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37406,Stan,[right at the camera] Stop it. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37408,Stan,[Stan's future self joins him in bed after freshening up in the bathroom] No. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37410,Stan,Quit it. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37413,Stan,Hey guys. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37417,Stan,This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37423,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37428,Stan,[under his breath] God-damnit! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37430,Stan,"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37432,Stan,"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37434,Stan,I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy! [gets off his seat and starts pacing the floor] Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37436,Stan,"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... [stops and then looks at Butters] Wait a minute, what'd you say? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37438,Stan,"[after a moment] Dude, how long has your future self been around? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37440,Stan,Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself from the future?? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37442,Stan,Where is he now? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37449,Stan,Liver medicine? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37452,Stan,"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37454,Stan,"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? [starts rifling through future Stan's clothes] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37456,Stan,"Here it is. [pulls out a wallet and reads the license. It's from the future, with LOSER printed in large letters on it and an expiration date of 10-19-2043] It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this? [pulls out a Motivation Corp. key card, expiring on 12/26/02] This expires in two thousand two. Why would he have this in his wallet? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37458,Stan,"[flips the card over to see the info on the other side] Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. [heads out the door.] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37461,Stan,Here it is. Motivation Corp. [the camera pans up to show the name of the building. Stan puts the card into the reader next to the door. The door opens and Stan heads in.] 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37463,Stan,"[walks up to Butters] Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. [heads in] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37466,Stan,What the hell is going on here? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37481,Stan,I can't believe it! It's all a scam! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37483,Stan,They've all been lying to us this whole time! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37485,Stan,"[closes his eyes a bit, then] Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37487,Stan,"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37489,Stan,"It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37491,Stan,Who's that? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37493,Stan,What? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37497,Stan,We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37499,Stan,"...You're gay? [Butters loses his moment] It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37501,Stan,"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! [walks off] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37505,Stan,"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37507,Stan,"[heading for the phone] Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. [picks up the phone receiver and starts punching in the numbers] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37509,Stan,"Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? [listens for the answer] Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37511,Stan,"[still on the phone] Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please? [listens and writes down the address] Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37513,Stan,Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. [hangs up] That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37515,Stan,"Fine, then you can come with me. [heads out the door] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37518,Stan,I guess this is it. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37520,Stan,"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37522,Stan,Cartman?? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37524,Stan,What the hell are you doing here?! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37527,Stan,"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. [both boys turn and walk towards the door] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37529,Stan,"[turns around] Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37531,Stan,How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37533,Stan,Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37537,Stan,How much is this going to cost us? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37561,Stan,[brightly] Yeah. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37563,Stan,Yeah. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37565,Stan,Yeah! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37568,Stan,"That's not neato, that sucks. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37570,Stan,You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought each revenge was unique and customized! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37572,Stan,"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have to admit that they lied to me! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37574,Stan,Dude! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37576,Stan,"No, that's too extreme! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37578,Stan,"Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! [leaves his seat and heads for the door.] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37581,Stan,Hey future self. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37583,Stan,"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? [future Stan looks at Stan as if the boy were crazy] You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep? "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37585,Stan,You must know what I'm talking about. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37589,Stan,"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. [Sharon and Randy shift in their chairs] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37591,Stan,"No. [plants his hands along the table's edge] You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax! [crosses his arms again] And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me! [uncrosses his arms] See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37593,Stan,What? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37616,Stan,"[takes a seat at the table] Hide and go seek, huh?! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37618,Stan,I don't believe that he's my future self! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37620,Stan,"No, I actually have a way to be sure. [whips out a meat cleaver in his right hand and places his left wrist on the table] I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37622,Stan,But I have to know for sure. [readies the cleaver] 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37624,Stan,Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it. 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37626,Stan,Yes? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37629,Stan,"[lowers the cleaver onto his wrist. The left hand falls away, and he lifts his left arm] AAAH! [a red area marks where the left hand was] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37633,Stan,"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37641,Stan,Butters! 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37643,Stan,"Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37645,Stan,"Butters, we're running away! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37647,Stan,"Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! [Stephen, Linda, and future Butters enter with groceries] "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37655,Stan,[watching his words fall apart] Huh? 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37660,Stan,Get the fuck out of here. [Randy and Sharon rush into the house] 
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37663,Stan,"Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37665,Stan,"I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe! "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37667,Stan,"I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning. "
6,16,My Future Self n' Me,37673,Stan,"Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37729,Stan,"Cartman, why are you doing this? "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37745,Stan,"Wuh, that smells. [lifts the front of his jacket over his nose] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37749,Stan,"Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. [Cartman stops] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37759,Stan,I don't know. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37765,Stan,Awww! [both of them release their breath and start coughing] 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37767,Stan,"God, it took forever! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37808,Stan,"Hang on, Santa! [switch to Baghdad] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37814,Stan,Why would Iraqis do that? Why? 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37820,Stan,Oh no. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37826,Stan,"Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37835,Stan,"I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37878,Stan,"Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37891,Stan,We're here. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37925,Stan,"[finding his voice] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37929,Stan,Oh my God. Iraqis killed Jesus. 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37935,Stan,"Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh... "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37946,Stan,"RPG, four o'clock! "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37965,Stan,[runs up to his parents] We brought Christmas to Iraq! 
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37971,Stan,"Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! [Cartman's joy vanishes] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37975,Stan,"Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. [Kenny walks into the frame.] "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37977,Stan,"Oh, hey Kenny. "
6,17,Red Sleigh Down,37981,Stan,"Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal. "
7,1,Cancelled,37993,Stan,"Dude, sweet! [Ike stands up] "
7,1,Cancelled,38003,Stan,Dude! Visitors! 
7,1,Cancelled,38006,Stan,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors! "
7,1,Cancelled,38008,Stan,"Visitors are real. They... [lowers his left eyebrow and thinks, looking down] Wait a minute. This has all happened before. "
7,1,Cancelled,38013,Stan,"No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that? "
7,1,Cancelled,38017,Stan,"I remember this whole thing. [to Kyle] Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream. "
7,1,Cancelled,38021,Stan,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef? "
7,1,Cancelled,38028,Stan,"Chef, we're in a repeat. "
7,1,Cancelled,38033,Stan,It all started when Cartman got an anal probe. 
7,1,Cancelled,38038,Stan,"You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes. "
7,1,Cancelled,38051,Stan,"Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times. "
7,1,Cancelled,38065,Stan,You all right? 
7,1,Cancelled,38069,Stan,"Where to now, Chef? "
7,1,Cancelled,38078,Stan,Go on. 
7,1,Cancelled,38095,Stan,"Oh, nice going, Cartman! "
7,1,Cancelled,38113,Stan,We wanted to see an alien planet or something. 
7,1,Cancelled,38117,Stan,What do we do??? 
7,1,Cancelled,38122,Stan,Let's go! 
7,1,Cancelled,38124,Stan,[startled] What is that? 
7,1,Cancelled,38128,Stan,"Chef! End of the road! [several barricades are up, with STOP signs hanging on the, and one sign saying ""ROAD CLOSED""] "
7,1,Cancelled,38135,Stan,It's the police! 
7,1,Cancelled,38138,Stan,"Chef!! [Chef sees yet another barricade and goes towards it, forcing the worker guarding it to jump out of the way/ Chef launches into the air once again. ""Dixie"" is heard from the car's horn. The aliens catch up to Chef and the boys and try the same jump. They end up upside down and unable to move. Chef spins the car a bit and looks back at the police cruiser] "
7,1,Cancelled,38145,Stan,Uh. [stirs and opens his eyes] Wugh. You guys. Wake up! [the other boys are in pods of their own] 
7,1,Cancelled,38147,Stan,We're in the alien ship. 
7,1,Cancelled,38151,Stan,[out of his pod] Guys. Look. [the others get out of theirs and walk towards Stan] 
7,1,Cancelled,38153,Stan,"My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space. "
7,1,Cancelled,38157,Stan,Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy. 
7,1,Cancelled,38160,Stan,Dad? 
7,1,Cancelled,38163,Stan,"Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact. "
7,1,Cancelled,38167,Stan,"Okay okay, take the form of something else! "
7,1,Cancelled,38170,Stan,"Nno, that's stupid too. [Cartman looks at Stan, deflated] "
7,1,Cancelled,38174,Stan,No! [the alien turns into George Burns] 
7,1,Cancelled,38197,Stan,I like it. 
7,1,Cancelled,38200,Stan,"You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass? "
7,1,Cancelled,38204,Stan,[looks back at his friends] Television? [the boys enter the next room. In that room visitors are all over the place manning the various aspects of a production company] 
7,1,Cancelled,38208,Stan,Our planet is just a reality-TV show? 
7,1,Cancelled,38212,Stan,Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment! 
7,1,Cancelled,38229,Stan,"Oh shit, did we do that? "
7,1,Cancelled,38233,Stan,"Wait! Wait, they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads! "
7,1,Cancelled,38236,Stan,"Please, take us to them! Please! "
7,1,Cancelled,38249,Stan,"Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads? "
7,1,Cancelled,38251,Stan,"Uh, Earth? "
7,1,Cancelled,38265,Stan,"Look, we just want to talk to you about the show. "
7,1,Cancelled,38271,Stan,"But, sirs, we think our show is just getting good. [Kyle thinks about the food, then decides to pick up a fork-full and taste it] I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other. "
7,1,Cancelled,38275,Stan,"Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us. "
7,1,Cancelled,38277,Stan,"Dude, we're trying to save our planet here! "
7,1,Cancelled,38282,Stan,"Sirs, uh, if you'll just let- "
7,1,Cancelled,38304,Stan,"Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. [Kenny whips out a camera and takes a picture] "
7,1,Cancelled,38311,Stan,"[glances at Cartman and quickly thinks] No, wait. We won't tell anybody if you don't cancel our show! "
7,1,Cancelled,38315,Stan,"I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent. "
7,1,Cancelled,38331,Stan,"Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. [Chef takes a look at the picture of the two Joozians sucking each other's jagons] "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38355,Stan,"Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. [""or other ways.""] "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38358,Stan,"Yeah dude, not cool. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38361,Stan,"Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38372,Stan,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38377,Stan,"That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. [Jimmy and Timmy turn and walk away] "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38385,Stan,"Cartman, trust me. [Kenny pushes his own truck away] We don't want any part in this one. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38477,Stan,"[admonishing] Stay clear, guys, stay clear. "
7,2,Krazy Kripples,38624,Stan,"Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38634,Stan,"Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38636,Stan,See? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38643,Stan,Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool! 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38647,Stan,Like what? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38655,Stan,"[glares back at her, then softly] Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, art-whore! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38658,Stan,D'you think that's enough? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38667,Stan,Okay 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38675,Stan,Is this the right house? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38680,Stan,"Kyle, we all agreed to do this! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38687,Stan,"Let's go, Kyle! [drags him off. Kyle is transfixed for a bit, then turns to follow Stan. A last shot of the house, and then the boys reach their bus stop gasping for air.] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38695,Stan,"Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38715,Stan,We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38718,Stan,"Yes, dude! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38722,Stan,"Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38783,Stan,What about him? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38788,Stan,"Butters. [looks down, then away, then sniffs, then clears his throat. After a while, Butters just walks off] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38790,Stan,So what should we do? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38792,Stan,"[just looks at Cartman] ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38795,Stan,"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38846,Stan,"Cartman, what are you doing? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38848,Stan,"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed! "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38851,Stan,They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38856,Stan,We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38861,Stan,Butters? 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38884,Stan,He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it. 
7,3,Toilet Paper,38886,Stan,"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad. [to Kyle] I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38891,Stan,"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do. [points an accusing finger at Cartman] And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! [He, Kyle, and Kenny leave] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38909,Stan,"[appears] What is it, Cartman? [Kyle and Kenny trail Stan] "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38913,Stan,"Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final. "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38928,Stan,"You, you do? How? "
7,3,Toilet Paper,38946,Stan,Wugh! Two weeks of this! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38974,Stan,"Let's go see a movie! [they stop in their tracks as they hear ""No war! No war!""] "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38978,Stan,[pause] Uh... war? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,38983,Stan,Yeah. [the mic moves back to him as he looks at his sign] War is not my voice. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39004,Stan,[pointing] You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39012,Stan,"No, you just have to study. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39016,Stan,"[from behind his book] Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39034,Stan,How?! 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39059,Stan,Cartman? 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39062,Stan,Oh no... 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39066,Stan,"Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39071,Stan,Aww crap. 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39091,Stan,"I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39108,Stan,"Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress- "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39112,Stan,"Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39115,Stan,"Oh, no, nononono. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39121,Stan,"Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision- "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39127,Stan,"[stops at the open door] Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww. [turns around and returns to the table] Awww, now we lost two in our study group! "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39178,Stan,"Uh, we didn't do it. "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39182,Stan,"Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Savings and we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then- "
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39212,Stan,He does? [he and Kyle are shocked] 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39223,Stan,Can't be 
7,4,I'm a Little Bit Country,39238,Stan,What the hell are they doing now? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39305,Stan,"[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off! "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39401,Stan,What are you gloating about? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39567,Stan,What's the matter? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39580,Stan,What's she doing? 
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39582,Stan,"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it. "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39584,Stan,"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us look dumb? "
7,5,Fat Butt and Pancake Head,39586,Stan,"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39639,Stan,"All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. [offers up a business card] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39643,Stan,"It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. [moments later they reach a pink house and Stan knocks again. The door opens and an elderly woman looks out] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39645,Stan,"Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need solved, for a dollar? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39650,Stan,Have you reported this to any other authorities? 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39653,Stan,We're on the case. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39656,Stan,"Detective McCormick found something interesting. [a shot of Kenny, who just raises his arm and point to his right. The camera pans to Duke, the house pet, licking off the last of the pie] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39663,Stan,"You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time. [the scenario shows Mrs. Farnickle setting the pie on the sill, closing the windows and walking away] But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. [Mr. Farnickle shows up at the kitchen window, looking at the pie from inside the kitchen] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39666,Stan,His plan was to use a hammer. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39668,Stan,"Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. [the man plunges the shovel through the woman's neck and cleaves the head from the body. Blood pours out and stains the carpet] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39671,Stan,"The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. [the man is shown tossing the second leg into the tub, then stirring the solution so that the leg would sink in and disappear] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39676,Stan,Just the news. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39678,Stan,"[stays behind] Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39680,Stan,"Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! [shows off a crisp new one-dollar bill] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39687,Stan,Yes it is! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39692,Stan,"All right, Sarah, come over here. [everyone moves over to Kenny's desk. Sarah hops up on the witness chair] Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39694,Stan,"You got it, Ken? [Kenny finishes and nods] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39696,Stan,"Put that away, dude! [Kenny walks up to a small bulletin board of KeNnY'S mOST WANtED women, all of which have large boobs] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39701,Stan,"[turns to address Cartman] Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree. [the scenario begins. A view into the bedroom from the tree at night] He would have watched Sarah with her doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife. [a hand appears, then the opposite hand with a knife. The knife cuts the first hand as Sarah drops her doll on the bedroom floor] The pain gave him sick pleasure. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39706,Stan,"[approaches the boy] Hey, kid, what are you doing? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39708,Stan,Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39712,Stan,Aw crap! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39717,Stan,Son of a bitch stupid FBI! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39719,Stan,No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that little girl's doll before those FBI guys do. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39722,Stan,We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39729,Stan,[behind the booth] They've gotten really good at this good-cop bad-cop thing. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39744,Stan,It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39764,Stan,[rushing up with Kyle and Kenny] Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39776,Stan,"[in hushed tones] Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! [Kenny turns and rings the bell. Inside, Bill and Fosse stop their play and go to the door] "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39778,Stan,South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39783,Stan,I don't know. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39785,Stan,"Dude, we just can't tell on them. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39793,Stan,Jesus! They're gonna kill her! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39797,Stan,"[he and the others approach the FBI kids] Hey, you butt-holes can't play FBI here! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39800,Stan,We're gonna charge the front door and go get it. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39804,Stan,Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39808,Stan,We go get the doll ourselves. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39810,Stan,That's right. [cocks his left hand] But they didn't say anything about going in the back. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39813,Stan,"[pops up from the couch and fires away, using the back of the couch as a shield] Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse! "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39815,Stan,Did so! 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39823,Stan,"[getting the doll after he, Kyle and Kenny approach the chair] We got it. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39825,Stan,"Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39831,Stan,"We do what we can, sir. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39837,Stan,Sure. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39843,Stan,I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. [they turn and walk towards a large building in the distance] 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39845,Stan,"Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39850,Stan,Damn. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39853,Stan,"Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the- "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39864,Stan,[softly] We just wanna be junior detectives. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39877,Stan,"It'll get better, guys. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39879,Stan,"[puts his soap away] Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time into it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39881,Stan,"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle? "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39883,Stan,"You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. I'll see you guys at school tomorrow. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39914,Stan,"Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff. "
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39923,Stan,No thanks. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39968,Stan,Thanks. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39970,Stan,...I think I have a better idea. 
7,6,Lil' Crime Stoppers,39973,Stan,"[walks up with one of his outfits] Yes, I have a suit I need dry-cleaned, and pressed, please. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,39982,Stan,"Wow, dude. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40067,Stan,"Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. [begins to reminisce] "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40069,Stan,"[stops reminiscing, turns around, and walks back to the boys] We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40072,Stan,We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40077,Stan,We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! [the boys start thinking] 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40079,Stan,We need something that'll get us money tomorrow! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40085,Stan,"Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40097,Stan,Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40099,Stan,No! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40101,Stan,"I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40104,Stan,"Look, we- we've got nothing to lose. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40113,Stan,Dad. [Randy turns around] Good luck. 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40118,Stan,[begins to wish hard] Come on! Come on! [the dealer starts the wheel and tosses the ball in the opposite direction. Everyone looks on in anticipation. The ball slows down and settles in on thirty one black.] 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40135,Stan,"They, they had it! They freakin' had it! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40137,Stan,You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some. 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40139,Stan,A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40141,Stan,What??? 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40143,Stan,"You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! [Randy brakes the car angrily] "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40149,Stan,"[walks up to Randy, who is in line with the others] Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40152,Stan,"[walks with his friends to a clearing where he could be heard] Come on, you guys! This is our town! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40154,Stan,We can stay. And fight. 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40160,Stan,"Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now! [the adults look back helplessly] Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! [the boys leave. Cartman stays behind.] "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40164,Stan,No! We won't let you destroy our town! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40166,Stan,"Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40171,Stan,This land is not for sale. 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40208,Stan,"It's all right, dad. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40210,Stan,"[looks over] She's hanging in there. [looks at Randy again] Here, drink some beer. [Randy turns his head aside a bit so he can take a sip, then resets his head] "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40212,Stan,You're gonna be all right. 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40214,Stan,"No, Dad, NO. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40216,Stan,What can I do? 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40218,Stan,"Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40222,Stan,"Hey, my name's Stan, and I was- "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40224,Stan,"Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS? "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40228,Stan,An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay. 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40230,Stan,"[disgusted] Ah! Oh, dude! "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40246,Stan,Dad! Dad! 
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40248,Stan,"Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS. [reaches into the bag and pulls out each item as he names it] Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite. "
7,7,Red Man's Greed,40263,Stan,"Dude, who the hell are you? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40268,Stan,"Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40270,Stan,"So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40272,Stan,I know! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40274,Stan,"Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40280,Stan,"You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40282,Stan,"Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all?? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40285,Stan,"Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! [the boys excitedly pull Kyle along to South Park Mall] "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40322,Stan,"Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40325,Stan,"All right. Let's work it! [shimmies a bit. The boys turn and pass through the entrance, but stop in their tracks.] What the...? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40330,Stan,Hey Craig. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40338,Stan,These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40340,Stan,"Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40342,Stan,We're metrosexual!! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40352,Stan,Dude! W-what are you doing? 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40355,Stan,We're not straight! You're straight! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40403,Stan,"Wow, is that from Origins? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40407,Stan,"Well, what can we do about it? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40409,Stan,What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore. 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40411,Stan,"Yeah. Wait, what? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40416,Stan,"[returns with Cartman and Kenny] Hey, what's goin' on? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40477,Stan,"Wow, we look great! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40502,Stan,"You'd better shut up, Craig. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40504,Stan,It is not! 
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40508,Stan,"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you! "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40618,Stan,"Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us? "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40620,Stan,"Yeah. It's cool, holmes. "
7,8,South Park is Gay!,40622,Stan,"Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. [turns and walks away] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40628,Stan,"Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. [Cartman straightens up] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40633,Stan,"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. [Cartman paces the floor with arms behind his back] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40636,Stan,See what? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40642,Stan,I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40684,Stan,Hey dude. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40686,Stan,"No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40689,Stan,You got a computer? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40691,Stan,"See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40694,Stan,"Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40696,Stan,What the hell is that? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40729,Stan,"[apologetically] We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40754,Stan,"Boy, I'll say! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40758,Stan,"[walks off in the opposite direction] Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40761,Stan,Oh yeah. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40769,Stan,It is?? [Kyle's jaw drops] 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40774,Stan,"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40777,Stan,What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40813,Stan,"[sighs] Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40817,Stan,"[awed] Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy! "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40845,Stan,"I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band. "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40851,Stan,What?? 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40853,Stan,Is this for real?? This is for real! 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40857,Stan,"[joins Kyle and faces the crowd] Besides, maybe our songs would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. [shots of Rick James, Ozzy, Britney and two other acts.] "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40862,Stan,"So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman? Are you- gonna pay 'im? "
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40879,Stan,I thought albums win either gold or platinum. 
7,9,Christian Rock Hard,40896,Stan,Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40908,Stan,"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive? "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40910,Stan,But they kill people. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40919,Stan,"I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,40981,Stan,What is that? 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40985,Stan,I think so. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40988,Stan,What is he saying? 
7,10,Grey Dawn,40993,Stan, Oh! [drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face] 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41011,Stan,"Dad, I'm scared. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41013,Stan,I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41035,Stan,"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41041,Stan,"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41060,Stan,What's that? 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41066,Stan,The American Association of Retired Persons. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41131,Stan,Hey Dad. 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41133,Stan,"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them? "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41137,Stan,"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it? "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41142,Stan,"All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here [south entrance] and here [west entrance]. The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41150,Stan,"Yeah, I remember hearing about that. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41157,Stan,All right! 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41160,Stan,We did it! [Cartman is finished and the others look at him like he's crazy] 
7,10,Grey Dawn,41161,Stan,"...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41184,Stan,"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault! "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41186,Stan,"Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41188,Stan,"And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine. "
7,10,Grey Dawn,41193,Stan,"[to his friends] Dude, I hate my family. [looks down embarrassed and walks away] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41195,Stan,"Dude, I wonder where Kyle is. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41197,Stan,Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41205,Stan,[stands up] What's Casa Bonita? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41255,Stan,"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41333,Stan,"Yeah, it's kinda weird. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41336,Stan,Yeah. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41339,Stan,"Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. [exits] "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41413,Stan,Really? 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41416,Stan,"Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do. "
7,11,Casa Bonita,41438,Stan,I knew he'd turn up. 
7,11,Casa Bonita,41447,Stan,"Cartman, stop it! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41467,Stan,"Yeah, screw that kid! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41481,Stan,"Well, maybe he won't fight. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41485,Stan,"All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. [leaves] "
7,12,All About Mormons,41488,Stan,No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41490,Stan,I'm gonna kick your ass... [glances back] bitch. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41492,Stan,[off guard] Huh? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41494,Stan,"Dude, stop it. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41496,Stan,"Shut up, Butters! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41501,Stan,I'm... [stares back at Gary] going over to his house for dinner tonight. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41503,Stan,[stammering] He's a really nice kid. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41524,Stan,What's that? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41526,Stan,No. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41544,Stan,The... Book of Mormon? What's that? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41546,Stan,Who's Joseph Smith? [they laugh at his ignorance] 
7,12,All About Mormons,41549,Stan,No! 
7,12,All About Mormons,41579,Stan,What happened then? [a small timer rings] 
7,12,All About Mormons,41586,Stan,"No, I was supposed to be home at eight. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41592,Stan,...Hello? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41594,Stan,"[a few seconds later] Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41597,Stan,The guy who spoke to God and Jesus. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41599,Stan,That's not what the Harrisons said. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41601,Stan,The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41603,Stan,"They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41605,Stan,But that's just you and your friends. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41607,Stan,"Mr. Harrison said that I should be following Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41613,Stan,Yeah. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41665,Stan,See? That's what happened to me! 
7,12,All About Mormons,41669,Stan,"That's what they made me think, too! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41673,Stan,"Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41676,Stan,What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41680,Stan,"Wow, you made this? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41683,Stan,"Uh, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... [a car horn is heard] "
7,12,All About Mormons,41692,Stan,"[fumbling about] Uh, no. I've got a lot to do. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41705,Stan,[turns right and walks. Gary walks alongside] Yeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41707,Stan,What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41709,Stan,"Yeah, but... how? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41732,Stan,"Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41734,Stan,"It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41736,Stan,But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41744,Stan,[with reservations] Hey Gary. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41746,Stan,Dad! 
7,12,All About Mormons,41751,Stan,Yeah. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41774,Stan,...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet? 
7,12,All About Mormons,41776,Stan,"No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind? "
7,12,All About Mormons,41778,Stan,"No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translations were hidden! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41780,Stan,"[crosses his arms] I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41785,Stan,"Oh, stop it! [stands up] That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad! "
7,12,All About Mormons,41791,Stan,I'm not hanging around that kid anymore. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41793,Stan,"You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me. "
7,12,All About Mormons,41795,Stan,Oh brother. 
7,12,All About Mormons,41798,Stan,I don't? 
7,13,Butt Out,41833,Stan,"[rolls eyes] Ugh, Jesus Christ! [Cartman has his hands buried in his face] "
7,13,Butt Out,41841,Stan,"Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. [takes a cigarette from Kyle's pack, lights up, and puffs] "
7,13,Butt Out,41855,Stan,...Whoops. 
7,13,Butt Out,41866,Stan,"Mom... [Randy holds her tight] Dad, it was just a- "
7,13,Butt Out,41885,Stan,What?? 
7,13,Butt Out,41887,Stan,"Yeah, what's the problem? "
7,13,Butt Out,41890,Stan,"Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand. "
7,13,Butt Out,41946,Stan,Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice. 
7,13,Butt Out,41964,Stan,Huh? 
7,13,Butt Out,41967,Stan,"Yeah, maybe you're right. [Cartman walks out and catches up to the others] "
7,13,Butt Out,41994,Stan,"What are you doing, Cartman? "
7,13,Butt Out,41998,Stan,"[pushes away from the table] Well, get away from us then. "
7,13,Butt Out,42003,Stan,"Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own! "
7,13,Butt Out,42005,Stan,Daaaad! 
7,13,Butt Out,42007,Stan,Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us! 
7,13,Butt Out,42010,Stan,"Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember? "
7,13,Butt Out,42016,Stan,[yielding] Oh all right. 
7,13,Butt Out,42018,Stan,Why? 
7,13,Butt Out,42020,Stan,"So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. [all the boys stroke their chins] "
7,13,Butt Out,42032,Stan,Yup. 
7,13,Butt Out,42035,Stan,"It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do! "
7,13,Butt Out,42049,Stan,"Well, I guess we learned our lesson. "
7,14,Raisins,42052,Stan,"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen. "
7,14,Raisins,42054,Stan,Football. 
7,14,Raisins,42056,Stan,"Okay. 23! [Bebe appears behind him and taps him on the shoulder] Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! [Bebe taps him on the shoulder again. Stan turns and looks at her] "
7,14,Raisins,42058,Stan,What? [looks let down] 
7,14,Raisins,42060,Stan,"[moves forth to hold her up] Oh whoa, wait a minute. [Bebe turns around] What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  [This gets the other boys' attention] "
7,14,Raisins,42072,Stan,"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me? "
7,14,Raisins,42074,Stan,'Cause I need to know why she broke up. 
7,14,Raisins,42076,Stan,"[pleading] Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her? "
7,14,Raisins,42080,Stan,What? That's no answer! [nudges him a bit] Go tell her to be more direct with me. 
7,14,Raisins,42082,Stan,"Kyle, this is my life. [points at Jimmy] Jimmy! "
7,14,Raisins,42084,Stan,"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me? "
7,14,Raisins,42086,Stan,"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her, [thinks] tell her... [gestures] she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me. "
7,14,Raisins,42088,Stan,She's a continuing source of inspiration to me. 
7,14,Raisins,42094,Stan,Well? 
7,14,Raisins,42096,Stan,"[softly] Over? [walks away dejected. He's next seen in bed, a blanket hung across his window blocking out the outside light. He has his sheets drawn up tight against his chin. A few moments later, Kyle enters with Butters, Cartman, Jimmy and Kenny. Kyle studies his friend.] Jesus... "
7,14,Raisins,42098,Stan,"[softly, creaking] ...Go away. "
7,14,Raisins,42100,Stan,Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone? 
7,14,Raisins,42103,Stan,"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken... "
7,14,Raisins,42143,Stan,"Can we go, please? "
7,14,Raisins,42156,Stan,"No, dude, I feel worse! "
7,14,Raisins,42158,Stan,"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life! "
7,14,Raisins,42160,Stan,I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! [turns and opens one of the doors] 
7,14,Raisins,42162,Stan,Something I should have done a long time ago. [walks out the door and into the night] 
7,14,Raisins,42164,Stan,"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs] All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her! "
7,14,Raisins,42166,Stan,"[thinks] Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of? "
7,14,Raisins,42192,Stan,[with emotion in his voice] I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else. 
7,14,Raisins,42194,Stan,There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life. 
7,14,Raisins,42196,Stan,Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids. 
7,14,Raisins,42202,Stan,"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living? "
7,14,Raisins,42204,Stan,"All right, so how do I join you? "
7,14,Raisins,42206,Stan,...'K. 
7,14,Raisins,42223,Stan,"[dressed all in black, with a black hat with puffball] Yeah. "
7,14,Raisins,42225,Stan," [takes up his paper and reads his poem] There is darkness all around me Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe My heart has been raped.   "
7,14,Raisins,42227,Stan," [continues] The pain is everlasting. I miss you so much, babe. Want to hold you in my arms again, girl. Want to-   "
7,14,Raisins,42229,Stan,They're not? 
7,14,Raisins,42280,Stan,Well I don't drink coffee. 
7,14,Raisins,42283,Stan,[sips some coffee] Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. [sips some coffee. Pete jerks his hair back into place] 
7,14,Raisins,42285,Stan,So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so. 
7,14,Raisins,42290,Stan,What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token? 
7,14,Raisins,42292,Stan,Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain? 
7,14,Raisins,42295,Stan,[sips some coffee] ...conformist. 
7,14,Raisins,42337,Stan,Butters? 
7,14,Raisins,42339,Stan,What's the matter with you? 
7,14,Raisins,42346,Stan,Huh? But you just got dumped. 
7,14,Raisins,42349,Stan,"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all. "
7,14,Raisins,42351,Stan,"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. As Cartman would you say, Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. [walks off] "
7,14,Raisins,42355,Stan,"[arrives] Hey, can I join in? [the other boys turn around] "
7,14,Raisins,42357,Stan,"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way. [Tolkien and Wendy walk by at this point] Hey Wendy! [Tolkien and Wendy look] You're a bitch,.. Token? [flips him off] Right here, buddy. [Tolkien and Wendy walk off, insulted] "
7,14,Raisins,42359,Stan,Yeah. Let's play ball. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42414,Stan,"Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42416,Stan,Sure dude. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42419,Stan,"Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure? "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42422,Stan,"Dude, Cartman. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42425,Stan,"Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. [he, Cartman and Kenny leave. Cartman stops and returns] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42438,Stan,"[trying to rein in his dad's enthusiasm] Dad, don't get carried away. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42445,Stan,"Whoa whoa, Cartman. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42447,Stan,"Cartman, calm down! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42449,Stan,"It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42454,Stan,"Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42484,Stan,"No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not? "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42493,Stan,What's going on?? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42496,Stan,"Do something, Kyle! [Kyle grabs the controls and tries to steer the plane] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42501,Stan,"You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. [As they look in one direction, four Canadians pop up from some bushes and look at them. They drop back into the bushes before the boys turn back around] "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42532,Stan,"All right dude, let's get the hell out of here! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42543,Stan,I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42560,Stan,"Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister. "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42594,Stan,What? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42596,Stan,What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada. 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42600,Stan,[grimacing] Oh no! 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42629,Stan,And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. [sits between the two of them] 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42652,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! "
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42669,Stan,What is that? 
7,15,It's Christmas in Canada,42678,Stan,"[sighs] Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. [Cartman holds a towel over his left nostril, which is bleeding] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42684,Stan,"Oh my God, look! [the other boys turn and walk up] Martial arts weapons from the Far East. [the sign reads ""Martial arts weapons of the Far East""] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42686,Stan,"Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42690,Stan,"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought. [the boys turn back to face the table] I'll get the tonfas. [they look like the nightsticks police use, but made of wood] Those are so sweet. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42694,Stan,Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42698,Stan,"We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42702,Stan,"Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42704,Stan,[with his tonfa] Kiya! Kiya! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42707,Stan,"[sweeps one of his tonfa around and transforms] With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42709,Stan,"What's your ninja name, Kenny? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42712,Stan,"All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42721,Stan,"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go. [they walk off and approach Craig's house, which is done up in Japanese style. Stan stops and whispers] All right, this is it. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42725,Stan,"Ninja positions! [the boys get into their first positions and Craig opens the door] Hello, Craig! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42728,Stan,We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42731,Stan,"Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42736,Stan,"Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. [turns and walks away] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42741,Stan,"Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! [Butters shows up before them] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42746,Stan,"Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys. [the boys turn and walk off] We have a lot of work to do. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42758,Stan,"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42762,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42767,Stan,"Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42771,Stan,"I dunno. Craig, is that you? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42776,Stan,"[steps forth] Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa! [Stan strikes a battle pose and unleashes the energy from the tonfa tips. Butters shields himself with his cape, and the tonfa energy dissipates. Butters cackles] Hey kid, that knocks you down. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42778,Stan,"Yeah, huh, I got you! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42789,Stan,Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42792,Stan,"[he and Kyle rush over to Butters] Butters! Oh my God! [the boys gather around Butters] Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42797,Stan,"[tries to soothe Butters] Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42799,Stan,"Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! [Butters composes himself and cries softly, looking around from time to time for any sign of help] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42801,Stan,"Dude, shut up! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42803,Stan,What?! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42806,Stan,"Just stay still, Butters. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42812,Stan,God dammit! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42817,Stan,"We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42819,Stan,He's really old and going blind. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42822,Stan,We might pass him off as our pet. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42826,Stan,"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42834,Stan,All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42836,Stan,"[looks off to his left] Okay, it's clear. [turns right and walks on. Cartman and Kyle escort Butters between them] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42840,Stan,"Oh shit, somebody's coming! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42846,Stan,Where'd you get those? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42852,Stan,"Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42857,Stan,"Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? [Jimmy has already transformed and leaps into the air, twirling his kali sticks around, and lands in a powerful pose] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42863,Stan,"We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! [He begins his attack. The other boys move forth and the fight begins, as a song reminiscent of Japanese anime theme songs, mostly Japanese with occasional English words, starts playing; its lyrics appear as a sing-along along the bottom of the screen.] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42866,Stan,"Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait! [the song ends, and he looks around] Wait. [steps forward] Hold on a second. Where's Butters? [sees the open oven door, and no one in the oven] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42869,Stan,"[turns and faces Craig's boys] Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42875,Stan,"No dude, you gotta help us find him! "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42880,Stan,Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42890,Stan,Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42895,Stan,Bad. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42899,Stan,"Nothing, just... playing. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42911,Stan,Butters! 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42920,Stan,What? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42923,Stan,"Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42929,Stan,"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42938,Stan,"All right, the county fair's still open! [they spot Roger, shown in anime form, and approach his booth.] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42940,Stan,We have come to return the weapons we purchased. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42945,Stan,"What is it, Craig? "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42950,Stan,"Come on, Ninjas! [the boys make their way across the fairgrounds, but freeze in their tracks upon seeing the auction] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42952,Stan,"Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42958,Stan,"[softly] Good luck, Bulrog. [Cartman leaves, with only his footsteps indicating where he's going] "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42964,Stan,"Oh, Jesus. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42972,Stan,What? 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42979,Stan,"Just run with it, dude. "
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42985,Stan,Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about. 
8,1,Good Times with Weapons,42987,Stan,"[he and Kenny pull out their weapons] Yeah. Come on, ninjas. [they transform into their anime forms] We've got some more work to do. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,42992,Stan,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,42999,Stan,"Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on. "
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43037,Stan,So? 
8,2,Up the Down Steroid,43041,Stan,"That's really, really terrible, dude. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43233,Stan,Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43245,Stan,Things seem pretty quiet. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43254,Stan,"Oh God, here we go again. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43260,Stan,That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43301,Stan,"Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43303,Stan,[rises] Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43305,Stan,Dude. That movie sucked. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43307,Stan,How can they even call that a movie? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43309,Stan,"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43316,Stan,"Hey, we want our money back. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43318,Stan,That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43320,Stan,"That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43322,Stan,You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43324,Stan,"We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43326,Stan,W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43328,Stan,"Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! [he and Kenny storm off] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43333,Stan,"Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go. [clicks on the link] Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go. [picks up the phone and dials in] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43337,Stan,"Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43339,Stan,"No, no, no, no, we want our money back. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43341,Stan,We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43343,Stan,"Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43345,Stan,"Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43347,Stan,I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43349,Stan,"Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43351,Stan,"[in recognition] Wait a minute. Cartman?! [realizing he's been recognized, Cartman is speechless] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43353,Stan,"[packing] Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43355,Stan,"We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! [He leads Kenny out of his room] This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43385,Stan,"Thank you. [looks over his Map To The Stars' Homes] This must be the place. [they walk through a side door right under a guard's nose. He fails to notice them. They walk up the driveway and past the massive fountain] Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. [rings the doorbell. The door opens and Mel appears] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43387,Stan,"Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43389,Stan,"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please? "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43392,Stan,"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43394,Stan,Tor- torture you? 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43396,Stan,We don't want to torture you. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43398,Stan,"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you? "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43400,Stan,"Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43416,Stan,Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude! [catches a glimpse of a wallet on a table] Wait! There's his wallet! [runs up to it with Kenny] 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43418,Stan,"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? [Kenny hands Stan $2] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43420,Stan,"All right, let's get the hell out of here! [heads for the doors and opens one. Mel dances in wearing a Carmen Miranda outfit. Stan and Kenny head for another pair of doors. Stan opens it and Mel enters dressed as a clown] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43423,Stan,"Aah! Run, dude, run! "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43468,Stan,"Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. [net loss, sixty-nine dollars] But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43470,Stan,"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. [Mel Gibson closes in fast in his Mad Max gas truck and wearing Braveheart face paint] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43472,Stan,"Goddamn, that guy's crazy. [hops off his seat and runs up to the driver] Hey dude, you've gotta speed up. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43474,Stan,Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster. 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43476,Stan,"I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- [Mel plows into the bus, making both vehicles screech. The riders sway in their seats] "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43480,Stan,Yeah. I told you that! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43482,Stan,"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43511,Stan,"He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind. "
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43515,Stan,It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked! 
8,3,The Passion of the Jew,43517,Stan,"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43526,Stan,"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. [some kids come up behind Stan] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43555,Stan,"Chef, we just got served. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43561,Stan,"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess- "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43568,Stan,"Some, kids from Orange County. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43571,Stan,No. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43575,Stan,"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43577,Stan,But Dad- 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43588,Stan,"[carrying the car] Yeah, let's go race it right now![they run into the OC kids] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43618,Stan,What? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43628,Stan,I thought I was supposed to! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43630,Stan,But why? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43682,Stan,"I, I don't know. He seems all right. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43685,Stan,"[walks to Randy's bedside] Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43687,Stan,"Okay, good. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43689,Stan,[thinks and then walks off miffed] God dammit! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43691,Stan,"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43693,Stan,"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43697,Stan,"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43699,Stan,"[walks up to the red Goth] Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43704,Stan,Great! [they leave together] 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43708,Stan,"All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43710,Stan,The arcade? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43713,Stan,"Dude, he's incredible. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43715,Stan,"[catches up to Yao at the change machine] Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43717,Stan,Yeah. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43719,Stan,"[catches up] Dude, we need you. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43721,Stan,It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43723,Stan,"All right, that's three! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43725,Stan,Huh? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43727,Stan,Oh yeah. [thinks a bit with finger to chin] Wait a minute. I know just where to go! 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43730,Stan,Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43732,Stan,And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43734,Stan,So you'll do it? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43736,Stan,"All right, we just need one more person! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43738,Stan,What? The state tap champion is from here? Who? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43740,Stan,Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean... 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43745,Stan,"Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43747,Stan,"It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. [his smile vanishes as he begins to think back, then a small grimace appears.] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43749,Stan,"But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43752,Stan,We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43758,Stan,"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43760,Stan,"A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43764,Stan,"All right, so you're sure he can dance? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43772,Stan,"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43774,Stan,"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43789,Stan,"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43794,Stan,"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we? "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43797,Stan,"Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- [the others also speak, the others continue to argue, talking over one another.] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43801,Stan,"I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43803,Stan,Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43805,Stan,Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43807,Stan,"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43809,Stan,"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43811,Stan,And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward. 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43813,Stan,"But that isn't the point, Butters! [Butters resumes building his tiny town] The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man. "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43815,Stan,"[Firmly] Fine. [walks to the door and opens it] But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. [leaves and closes the door. Butters, angered, tosses some blocks into his town, then wipes the town off the desk.] "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43830,Stan,What? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43833,Stan,What happened?? 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43838,Stan,"Aw, what do we do, Chef?! "
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43844,Stan,Butters! [the SP crew moves towards him] 
8,4,You Got F'd in the A,43863,Stan,All right Butters! 
8,5,AWESOM-O,43992,Stan,"Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot? "
8,5,AWESOM-O,44002,Stan,"Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44209,Stan,"[stops and looks at a house] Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. [the other boys stop and look.] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44221,Stan,What's that you're wearing? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44231,Stan,"Whoa. Dude, no way! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44233,Stan,"Dude, are these all your toys? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44250,Stan,"[softly] Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44263,Stan,"Hey, you guys! You guys! [the kids gather around] You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44329,Stan,"I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44331,Stan,Yeah. It's just a dad and his son. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44345,Stan,"Fine, Mom. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44351,Stan,"No, my parents are. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44353,Stan,What? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44377,Stan,[looks out] Kyle? 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44380,Stan,Mr. Jefferson Awww! [hops off the bed] It's 1:30 in the morning! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44386,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44388,Stan,He just showed up here. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44390,Stan,Jesus Christ! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44395,Stan,I know. He's here. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44398,Stan,"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44404,Stan,"Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44419,Stan,Ahaa! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44422,Stan,Yeah. A really bad dream. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44424,Stan,Oh Jesus! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44451,Stan,"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44478,Stan,"Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44484,Stan,"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44486,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44490,Stan,"Stop, you fucking lunatic! [Mr. Jefferson's moustache falls off and down to the ground, he pulls Blanket back inside and closes the window] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44528,Stan,You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe. 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44532,Stan,"Blanket, you in here? "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44538,Stan,"All right dude, get in his bed. "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44540,Stan,"Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. [hops off and leaves] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44566,Stan,"Go, go, ruuun! [the boys run out of the bathroom] "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44571,Stan,[The boys enter Blanket's room] Oh Jesus! 
8,6,The Jeffersons,44578,Stan,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny! "
8,6,The Jeffersons,44585,Stan,"Run, Blanket, Run! "
8,7,Goobacks,44623,Stan,"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages? "
8,7,Goobacks,44628,Stan,"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut. "
8,7,Goobacks,44631,Stan,Whoa. 
8,7,Goobacks,44641,Stan,"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future! "
8,7,Goobacks,44647,Stan,"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em. "
8,7,Goobacks,44649,Stan,"Night, Mom. [after she leaves, he puts his arms up and behind his head and smiles] Wow, two people from the future. How cool. "
8,7,Goobacks,44653,Stan,"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today? "
8,7,Goobacks,44658,Stan,"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. [the boys turn to go back to the sidewalk...] "
8,7,Goobacks,44660,Stan,Son of a bitch! 
8,7,Goobacks,44672,Stan,"[pipes up] It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too! [silence] Oh, they took our jobs! "
8,7,Goobacks,44677,Stan,I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to- [an immigrant descends the stairs with a basket of dirty clothes and stops to ask Sharon something using guttural sounds] 
8,7,Goobacks,44679,Stan,[leery] Who is that? 
8,7,Goobacks,44681,Stan,"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs! "
8,7,Goobacks,44685,Stan,"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away. "
8,7,Goobacks,44687,Stan,I wanted my job! 
8,7,Goobacks,44690,Stan,Timecist? 
8,7,Goobacks,44692,Stan,"People from the future. Right, got it. "
8,7,Goobacks,44717,Stan,That's right! [other students speak up] 
8,7,Goobacks,44744,Stan,Can you speak in present-day English please? 
8,7,Goobacks,44746,Stan,"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries. "
8,7,Goobacks,44748,Stan,"[getting annoyed] No, a double cheeseburger and fries! "
8,7,Goobacks,44750,Stan,What?! 
8,7,Goobacks,44754,Stan,I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger! 
8,7,Goobacks,44756,Stan,"No, not a chicken sandwich! [his parents enter the restaurant and stand in line behind him and the boys] I want a goddamn cheeseburger and some goddamn fries you fucking goobacks! "
8,7,Goobacks,44758,Stan,Aw- awwww! 
8,7,Goobacks,44774,Stan,"Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you? "
8,7,Goobacks,44787,Stan,They took yer jarb!! 
8,7,Goobacks,44799,Stan,"I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. [loosens up and opens his eyes] They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. [the mound of men stops copulating] "
8,7,Goobacks,44801,Stan,"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work. "
8,7,Goobacks,44812,Stan,We're doing it! 
8,7,Goobacks,44815,Stan,"Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second. [drops his shovel] This is gay. "
8,7,Goobacks,44818,Stan,"Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile. [everyone races back to the pile. The men take off their clothes] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44842,Stan,"But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44849,Stan,"This is bullcrap, dude! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44867,Stan,"Dude, I really don't care. [walks away] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44913,Stan,"[exiting] Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44917,Stan,I'm not voting! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44919,Stan,I just think this whole thing is stupid! [walks off angrily] 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44924,Stan,It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44927,Stan,"No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44930,Stan,"Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44940,Stan,Puff Daddy? 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44942,Stan,I... 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44944,Stan,"""Vote or Die""? [upset] What the hell does that even mean?! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44946,Stan,Aaaah! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44963,Stan,...Okay. I'll vote. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44979,Stan,"I guess... [P Diddy and his posse look on from one end of the polling station, with P cocking his gun] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44981,Stan,"Okay. [finishes up and seals his ballot, then walks away] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44983,Stan,I'm voting. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44985,Stan,"Yeah, I know. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44987,Stan,[annoyed] I thought I was supposed to make my own decision. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,44989,Stan,"Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44992,Stan,"Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it! "
8,8,Douche and Turd,44996,Stan,The whole thing is a joke! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45003,Stan,B-bani-banishment? 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45007,Stan,"You-you're all joking, right? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45011,Stan,I'm not voting! [Kyle then steps forth and repeats what the others did before him] 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45015,Stan,"Dad, isn't this a little extreme? "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45020,Stan,Hello? [the people gather round and remove the pail] 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45023,Stan,"Oh, thank God. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45028,Stan,Awww! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45031,Stan,What about me? 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45036,Stan,I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45038,Stan,"Wow, you guys really love animals. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45042,Stan,I'll live with you. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45044,Stan,He said I can stay. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45066,Stan,"Ahh, no thanks, that's okay. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45068,Stan,"I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do. "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45070,Stan,I can't. I was banished for not voting. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45072,Stan,I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45074,Stan,"I guess... I guess you're right. [casts his eyes down and to the left in reflection. An arm appears, with a gun at the end aimed at Stan] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45076,Stan,[jumps] Aaah! 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45080,Stan,"[braves his way through the crossfire, but gets hit on his left shoulder] Aaaah!! [keeps moving] "
8,8,Douche and Turd,45093,Stan,I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have. 
8,8,Douche and Turd,45100,Stan,"Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45111,Stan,...What? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45117,Stan,It's time for what? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45145,Stan,"Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45169,Stan,"Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. [Kyle turns, and the three remaining boys walk away.] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45172,Stan,Butters? [more strange noises come from Butters' mouth] 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45175,Stan,"Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. [the boys turn and leave.] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45177,Stan,"Dad? [looks around at all the stuff] Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45179,Stan,"Dad, oh my God! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45181,Stan,"What? D-dad, are are you dying? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45183,Stan,But you-your face! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45202,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45204,Stan,"Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- [knocks over his glass of milk, which spills onto Shelly] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45209,Stan,"But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at- "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45217,Stan,Dad! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45238,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45240,Stan,"Dad, you're a geologist! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45247,Stan,Where are they? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45252,Stan,"Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45258,Stan,"Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. [he and Kenny head for the doors] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45265,Stan,"Dude, come on! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45267,Stan,"Dude, we have to go! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45269,Stan,"Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45272,Stan,"Goddamn, that took a long time. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45281,Stan,Where's he? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45286,Stan,There has to be a way! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45292,Stan,Why don't you guys just destroy the heart? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45296,Stan,"No, dude, don't! [Mr. Brown shoots himself through the temple and falls over on his left side, dead. Seconds later he craps through his pants, leaving a hole in them and a fallen bar stool nearby. A few moments of shock, and then Cartman cracks up] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45319,Stan,"Save it, Grandpa! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45322,Stan,"Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart. "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45324,Stan,One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45326,Stan,What?! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45328,Stan,"Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! [the three make their way to the back, but Randy can't help but look at all the bargains] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45331,Stan,"Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?! [looks around, then turns to his right. Kyle turns to his left. Both boys see Randy] Dad! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45333,Stan,"Come on, Dad! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45335,Stan,"No, dad! We need your keys! "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45337,Stan,[passing the candy display] There! The television department! 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45342,Stan,You? 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45344,Stan,"[""We don't want your store in our town we come to destroy you. ""]"
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45347,Stan,Me. I'm asking the question. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45349,Stan,"Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart? "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45353,Stan,It's a mirror. 
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45355,Stan,"Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. [the boys turn and face the mirror again, and Kyle takes a black mallet to it. It shatters.] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45357,Stan,"We'd better get out of here. [outside, Cartman and Kenny stop wrestling and witness the Wall-Mart rumbling and there's lighting flying around it. Inside, Stan and Kyle make their way to the front doors] "
8,9,Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes,45359,Stan,"Dad, come on! We've gotta get out! "
8,10,Pre-School,45378,Stan,"Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now! "
8,10,Pre-School,45380,Stan,"[pulls Kyle away] Right now, goddamnit! "
8,10,Pre-School,45382,Stan,[the look of fear is strong on his face] Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. [the boys are suddenly afraid] 
8,10,Pre-School,45385,Stan,Yeah! He just got paroled! 
8,10,Pre-School,45392,Stan,What the hell are we gonna do?? 
8,10,Pre-School,45399,Stan,"Dude, let's play Fireman. "
8,10,Pre-School,45405,Stan,"Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes! "
8,10,Pre-School,45415,Stan,Start one. Then we're gonna put it out. 
8,10,Pre-School,45418,Stan,"Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time. "
8,10,Pre-School,45424,Stan,"Wow, cool! "
8,10,Pre-School,45426,Stan,"[walks up to the crumples sheet] Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang! [drops his pants and begins pissing on the paper] Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! [the other boys come and imitate the fire truck noises while pissing on the paper. Trent looks on.] "
8,10,Pre-School,45427,Stan,We're heroes! 
8,10,Pre-School,45433,Stan,"Put it out, put it out! [Cartman runs up to their teacher and starts pissing on her. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny follow suit] "
8,10,Pre-School,45436,Stan,"Dude, we are in so much trouble! "
8,10,Pre-School,45439,Stan,That's true. 
8,10,Pre-School,45441,Stan,No! 
8,10,Pre-School,45451,Stan,"Yeah, who cares? "
8,10,Pre-School,45454,Stan,Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released. 
8,10,Pre-School,45457,Stan,"Shhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. [a soft noise is heard, and in rolls a futuristic wheelchair, encasing Ms. Claridge] "
8,10,Pre-School,45459,Stan,"[nervously] Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? [a yellow button on the machine lights up and beeps. She turns left and rolls away] "
8,10,Pre-School,45507,Stan,"Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection. "
8,10,Pre-School,45509,Stan,I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! [the boys run off] 
8,10,Pre-School,45514,Stan,"Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders. "
8,10,Pre-School,45516,Stan,We've come to... ask you for help. 
8,10,Pre-School,45524,Stan,Yeah. 
8,10,Pre-School,45528,Stan,What?! 
8,10,Pre-School,45531,Stan,"Dude, weak! "
8,10,Pre-School,45533,Stan,[after some thought] No! 
8,10,Pre-School,45549,Stan,"You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class. "
8,10,Pre-School,45551,Stan,"But mom, my teacher will- "
8,10,Pre-School,45553,Stan,[normal] But Mo-o-o- 
8,10,Pre-School,45555,Stan,This is hopeless! 
8,10,Pre-School,45557,Stan,"That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs! "
8,10,Pre-School,45559,Stan,"No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of. "
8,10,Pre-School,45565,Stan,How do you know?! 
8,10,Pre-School,45567,Stan,"All right, fine. [draws some nipples on Cartman's ass, checking the book to be sure. He then steps back] "
8,10,Pre-School,45572,Stan,Excuse me! 
8,10,Pre-School,45574,Stan,"[steps forward] We, we got it. [pulls out the photo. The sixth graders ride up to the boys] "
8,10,Pre-School,45592,Stan,"Dude, are we gonna be like that someday? "
8,10,Pre-School,45597,Stan,"Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing? [she's still in the crosswalk] Ms. Claridge? "
8,10,Pre-School,45607,Stan,"Dude, what happened? "
8,10,Pre-School,45611,Stan,What's that? 
8,10,Pre-School,45614,Stan,We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him. 
8,10,Pre-School,45617,Stan,"No, no, we've just gotta find better help. "
8,10,Pre-School,45619,Stan,[looks down] There is... one person. 
8,10,Pre-School,45621,Stan,Shelly? 
8,10,Pre-School,45623,Stan,"Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other. "
8,10,Pre-School,45625,Stan,"Shelly [hesitates, begins to tear up] Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. [begins to cry. Shelly notices, puts her bowl aside, hops off the sofa, and walks up to Stan] "
8,10,Pre-School,45627,Stan,"Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault. "
8,10,Pre-School,45629,Stan,"We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us! "
8,10,Pre-School,45635,Stan,Admit it was our fault? 
8,10,Pre-School,45642,Stan,"Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. [no reply] "
8,10,Pre-School,45646,Stan,"See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was ""Fireman."" "
8,10,Pre-School,45649,Stan,"Trent, look, we've realized our mistake! [Trent advances, the boys back up] "
8,10,Pre-School,45655,Stan,What is that? 
8,10,Pre-School,45668,Stan,"Yeah, who cares? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45686,Stan,"Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45698,Stan,[returning from the kitchen to serve as cameraman] And we're... cut! [turns off the camera] 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45701,Stan,"Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45708,Stan,...Craig's show?? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45712,Stan,But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45721,Stan,Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45726,Stan,"[look at Cartman, but notices someone else] Hey, look, Craig just walked in. [Craig enters to cheers from the other kids in the restaurant and waves back to them. Several kids take pictures of Craig] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45734,Stan,"Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! [holds up a fist with thumb and index finger just a centimeter apart] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45747,Stan,"Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45750,Stan,"Come on, guys! [the boys leave] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45752,Stan,"All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45756,Stan,"Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45762,Stan,"We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders... "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45764,Stan,Good! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45770,Stan,"All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45779,Stan,"Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45792,Stan,"Then, let's do Tolkien's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45803,Stan,"No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45809,Stan,I knew we could do it! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45813,Stan,Craig's new show? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45817,Stan,Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45820,Stan,[stunned] I don't believe it. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45825,Stan,"Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45829,Stan,"Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas? "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45833,Stan,"Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on! [time passes. Stan begins to pace the floor again] How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45836,Stan,Crab people? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45838,Stan,"[looks at Cartman, then gets annoyed] Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45844,Stan,"We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45852,Stan,"[reaches out and grabs one, then steps back] How about this one? Calminex? [reads the label] ""Warning: Taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects."" "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45856,Stan,"Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45863,Stan,I guess we'll just take all of 'em. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45887,Stan,It's... it's the greatest show of all time. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45891,Stan,"You guys. You guys, wake up! [the boys are roused] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45896,Stan,We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything. 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45899,Stan,"You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45901,Stan,"No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now. [strokes his chin] I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine! "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45906,Stan,"[voice over] They're doing it in the hallways! [a shot of Tweek downing some cough syrup, then jumping in surprise with his iconic yelp and running away] Behind the school! [a shot of the Goth kids downing cough medicine] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45908,Stan,"Even in the girls' bathroom! [a shot of Bebe and Red in the restroom viewed through an air vent. Bebe takes a sip from a bottle of cough medicine, gives it to Red to sip, then notices something in the air vent] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45910,Stan,[a shot of Jimmy and Principal Victoria looking at the report] We showed the shocking footage to the principal! 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45918,Stan,"The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: riddled their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. [a shot of the hallways from the entrance. All the kids are coughing and walking around. Some of them sneeze] "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45924,Stan,"[knowingly] Gee, what a coincidence. "
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45930,Stan,Nobody has any ideas? 
8,11,Quest for Ratings,45934,Stan,...Bail. [everyone leaves the table] 
8,12,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,46181,Stan,"Oh, thank God. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46236,Stan,"Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. [Cartman is shown at the edge of the roof wearing wings made from cardboard] "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46238,Stan,"[""It's not gonna work just come down from there. ""]"
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46241,Stan,Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. [Kyle looks up to see what the others see. Cartman looks down] 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46250,Stan,[to Kenny] He's not gonna do it. 
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46405,Stan,"Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea! "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46409,Stan,"[under his breath] Butters, Goddammit. "
8,13,Cartman's Incredible Gift,46411,Stan,"[a few moments later, sighs] Call an ambulance. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46506,Stan,[walks by with a sled] What the hell? 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46511,Stan,It's... nice. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46521,Stan,"Okay, okay. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46529,Stan,"[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46532,Stan,Woof. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46535,Stan,"Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46537,Stan,"[irritated, grabs his clock] What time is it?! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46540,Stan,"[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46544,Stan,...What? 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46565,Stan,"[as they sing] All right, I'm going now. [He ambles off. A roar is heard nearby. All stop and look. The critters scream.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46567,Stan,Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.] 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46572,Stan,Again? 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46582,Stan,"Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46585,Stan,"[gesturing] Grrr! Grrr! Come on out! [The lion is heard roaring from inside the cave, and it roars. It approaches the entrance.] Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! [Anticipating the lion's leap, he runs off. The lion lunges at him, but misses. Stan moves to the side of the peak and turns, gesturing.] Rawrrrrr! [Stan runs up the side of the peak, and the lion follows. Stan reaches the peak and turns to face the lion. The lion lunges at Stan again. Stan drops out of the way and the lion goes over the peak and onto its death below, at the cave entrance.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46588,Stan,"Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46591,Stan,"[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46593,Stan,[turns away and squeezes his eyes shut] Aw- awww! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46606,Stan,It's dead. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46609,Stan,I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46612,Stan,"Wait, wha-what? "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46615,Stan,"Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46617,Stan,But I thought you meant the Son of God! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46631,Stan,Ugh. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46633,Stan,Uuugh! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46635,Stan,"[waves the narrator away and leaves his desk] No, no-no-no. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46637,Stan,Leave me alone!! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46639,Stan,"All right, all right, all right! God! [He turns off the TV, hops off the sofa and walks out the door, leaving the remote control on the floor.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46649,Stan,I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46655,Stan,No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist! [walks off] I came here to put a stop to all this! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46658,Stan,"Right, whatever. [turns around] I'm taking down the manger I built. [Beary's eyes turn red and brighten. A wall of hellfire appears before Stan.] Ah! [The wall gets higher.] Aaaah! [All the critters' eyes are flashing a bright red. Black crows swoop down and attack Stan.] Aagh! Aaaahh! [A two-headed demon dog appears snarling at him; he runs off in terror.] AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [The critters' eyes revert back to normal.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46665,Stan,Oh yeah. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46667,Stan,Hello? Anybody in there? [the three cubs appear at the entrance of the cave] 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46672,Stan,"Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46674,Stan,"I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46676,Stan,"Well, you're mountain lions. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46680,Stan,There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46686,Stan,[cross] What?! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46688,Stan,"No, he didn't. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46690,Stan,"No, he didn't! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46692,Stan,"No, he didn't! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46694,Stan,"Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46699,Stan,"I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46704,Stan,"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46727,Stan,"Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born? "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46734,Stan,Too late?! The hell is that?! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46737,Stan,"It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46740,Stan,"[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46749,Stan,"I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46752,Stan,"Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46755,Stan,"[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.] "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46760,Stan,What?! Kyle?! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46763,Stan,Dude! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46777,Stan,"No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46779,Stan,"Well, after all that, I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46788,Stan,"Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46791,Stan,"No Santa, don't! "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46794,Stan,The lion cubs! 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46796,Stan,I took them to see how abortions are done. 
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46798,Stan," Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast! Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!   "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46803,Stan,"[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is. "
8,14,Woodland Critter Christmas,46808,Stan,"[relieved] Oh, good. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46833,Stan,"Dude, don't be nervous. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46835,Stan,"You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46839,Stan,"Good luck. [Kyle reaches center court and is flanked by tall black players on either side. He looks around, seeing how much taller these players are than he. Two of them have basketballs; Kyle has his own ball] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46848,Stan,"Dude, you were awesome, Kyle. [no response. Stan looks at Kenny, then looks back at Kyle] Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. [looks at Kenny, shrugs, and walks away. Kenny walks over, puts his hand on Kyle's shoulder for consolation, then walks away. Cartman looks a bit concerned, walks over to Kyle... and taunts him!] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46862,Stan,"Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46893,Stan,Wha-a-a negroplasty?? 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46895,Stan,"Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea? "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46965,Stan,What? 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46972,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude! "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,46976,Stan,"Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin? "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47021,Stan,"[points down the road] Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison. "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47025,Stan,What?! But you made him into a basketball player. 
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47060,Stan,"Oh Jesus, he's about to play! [Three of the guards get into position at the top of the stariway aisle and start shooting at them. Down by the court Dr. Biber takes a steel trash can and bashes one guard with it] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47066,Stan,"Kyle, NO! [Kyle dribbles and then jumps up towards the basket] "
9,1,Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina,47071,Stan,"Yeah, that's basically it. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47106,Stan,"All right. [the two parties meet] 'Scuse me. [holds out a clipboard] Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice? "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47110,Stan,Who are the corporations? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47112,Stan,Are you serious? We never heard that. 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47117,Stan,Well... Well what do we do? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47135,Stan,"Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47137,Stan,"Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47161,Stan,"Right, so how do we get back at them? "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47167,Stan,[alarmed] NO! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47203,Stan,Yeah! 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47257,Stan,So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47262,Stan,You mean like a baker and a cop? 
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47306,Stan," Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage! "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47317,Stan,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing? [the crowd quiets down] It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something? "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47319,Stan,"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long? "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47333,Stan,"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here. "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47335,Stan,"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? [the stage is shown. All of a sudden the digger smashes into it, stopping the festival in its tracks. The crowd looks towards the stage] "
9,2,"Die Hippie, Die",47356,Stan,Dad! 
9,3,Wing,47366,Stan,Token sings? 
9,3,Wing,47373,Stan,"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine? "
9,3,Wing,47378,Stan,Yeah. We're too smart to be talented. 
9,3,Wing,47382,Stan,Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does. 
9,3,Wing,47386,Stan,He's looking at the sign. 
9,3,Wing,47388,Stan,All right. 
9,3,Wing,47392,Stan,It's genius. 
9,3,Wing,47402,Stan,"[sitting Tolkien down on the sofa] Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man. "
9,3,Wing,47416,Stan,"You guys, we're gonna lose our client. [the boys come into view again] "
9,3,Wing,47419,Stan,"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can. "
9,3,Wing,47421,Stan,"This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie. "
9,3,Wing,47425,Stan,"Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us! "
9,3,Wing,47432,Stan,"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client? "
9,3,Wing,47439,Stan,"You were awesome, Token! "
9,3,Wing,47446,Stan,This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now. 
9,3,Wing,47451,Stan,"[interjecting] Uh excuse me, Token already has representation. "
9,3,Wing,47465,Stan,So unfair... so unfair. 
9,3,Wing,47469,Stan,Huh? 
9,3,Wing,47471,Stan,You were looking for a talent agent? 
9,3,Wing,47473,Stan,And what does she do? 
9,3,Wing,47475,Stan,"Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us. "
9,3,Wing,47480,Stan,Yeah! 
9,3,Wing,47486,Stan,"Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything? "
9,3,Wing,47488,Stan,"Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV. "
9,3,Wing,47490,Stan,"Uh sure, here she is. [Stan puts the phone to Wing's ear, and Mr. Kim begins barking at her again] Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family. [outside there's a flash of light and three shadows pass through the doors] Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease? [the men come into the light. They are three buff Chinese men] Aw crap, Chinese Mafia! [one of the men walks around behind the counter, grabs Mr. Kim's head with one hand and places a knife against his chin with the other] Aaaaahh! [the two men move around to the eating area and are met by four other Tong members] "
9,3,Wing,47507,Stan,There it is! American Idol contestants! 
9,3,Wing,47511,Stan,Ah our client has an audition to this show. 
9,3,Wing,47516,Stan,"Oh no, no no no, come on! [the boys return to the attendants] Excuse me, ma'am. "
9,3,Wing,47518,Stan,"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. [the woman] "
9,3,Wing,47524,Stan,We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday! 
9,3,Wing,47528,Stan,We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away! 
9,3,Wing,47532,Stan,"All right, our client will do it! "
9,3,Wing,47536,Stan,"What's ""The Contender""? "
9,3,Wing,47547,Stan,"Go Wing! [Kenny cheers on as well, but he's hard to understand. The bell rings. Wing's music comes up and she begins to sing ""Fernando"" as Fernanda sizes her up] "
9,3,Wing,47555,Stan,Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado? 
9,3,Wing,47559,Stan,"Oh, thanks. "
9,3,Wing,47564,Stan,You do? [Stallone mumbles some more] 
9,3,Wing,47568,Stan,"We won't! [Stallone mumbles some more, then leaves with his men] "
9,3,Wing,47570,Stan,"You guys, you guys! "
9,3,Wing,47572,Stan,Sylvester Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars! 
9,3,Wing,47577,Stan,Yeah! 
9,3,Wing,47583,Stan,"Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? [the joy leaves instantly] "
9,3,Wing,47586,Stan,"...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again. "
9,3,Wing,47593,Stan,"Oh no! [he points towards Wing, who's now being put into a limousine. The boys race over] Hey! That's our client! [the driver gets into the limo and drives off] "
9,3,Wing,47598,Stan,"[walking up the driveway with his friends] Two four nine all right, this is the place. "
9,3,Wing,47604,Stan,Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now! 
9,3,Wing,47607,Stan,"You tell 'em, Kyle! "
9,3,Wing,47609,Stan,"Jesus, they really want Wing as their client! "
9,3,Wing,47612,Stan,"No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents! "
9,3,Wing,47616,Stan,"We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! [Kyle and Kenny move away from the gunfire, Stan goes towards Cartman. Kyle and Kenny enter a blue room] "
9,3,Wing,47624,Stan,You bastards! 
9,3,Wing,47627,Stan,"Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are! "
9,3,Wing,47632,Stan,"[intervening] Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of. "
9,3,Wing,47634,Stan,Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities. 
9,3,Wing,47638,Stan,It's a lousy business. I quit. 
9,3,Wing,47648,Stan,"I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. [""Just sing..."" Tolkien appears in the background] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47676,Stan,"[answering for Kenny] It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan. [Cartman walks up to the other boys, but he's quite upset. He crosses his arms] Dude, you see what Kenny got? "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47682,Stan,"Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47760,Stan,Are we in trouble or something? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47764,Stan,Oh wow... 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47770,Stan,Please what? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47776,Stan,What? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47785,Stan,Kenny? 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47787,Stan,"Dude, how'd you do that? "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47793,Stan,"Yeah, the lawyer lost that page. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47838,Stan,"Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! [they walk through the angels, then the angels turn around] "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47844,Stan,Yeah! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47846,Stan,"Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny. "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47852,Stan,Don't kill Kenny! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47854,Stan,Don't kill Kenny! 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47900,Stan,"Well, what does it say? "
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47902,Stan,Oooo. 
9,4,Best Friends Forever,47905,Stan,"You mean, Cartman's side is right? "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47952,Stan,"[turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Aw Jesus, not again. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47955,Stan,Yes! It's over! It's over! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47959,Stan,We can start having fun again! [falls to the ground and rolls around] 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47961,Stan,We did it! We did it! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47963,Stan,... What? 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47969,Stan,No... NOOO!! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47975,Stan,"Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47977,Stan,"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47981,Stan,I know we can lose if we try. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,47985,Stan,"Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,47994,Stan,"Hundred bucks, no big whoop. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48007,Stan,"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh, [pulls out a yellow sheet of paper] here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48016,Stan,"Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?! "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48032,Stan,Damnit! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48046,Stan,No! 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48067,Stan,"[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Goddamnit... [the men have taken the fight to the field and are next to a trashcan. Stan pitches and the FC batter fails to swing] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48070,Stan,Aw spit! [throws his mitt down on the mound. His father is arrested again with his pants around his ankles and hauled towards a waiting patrol car] 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48102,Stan,"Oh no. No, no, no! "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48104,Stan,"Dad? Dad, we need to talk. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48106,Stan,[sighs] Goddamnit. [goes back into the restaurant] 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48113,Stan,I don't suppose you guys want to win this game. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48117,Stan,Gay. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48138,Stan,Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win. 
9,5,The Losing Edge,48149,Stan,"Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48183,Stan,"Wow, he IS great at sucking. "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48196,Stan,"Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our team suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. [next pitch: the ball hits the bat again, and the SP runner has to go to first, as it's a bunt. Tolkien goes up. The pitch hits the bat at the top - another bunt] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48217,Stan,"[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] This can't get any worse. [the two men continue fighting at the bottom of the level and towards the foul pole. Bat Dad picks Randy up and throws him over the railing. Randy bounces off a bench, breaking it in two.] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48221,Stan,"[comes off the mound and stands next to Kyle] Disqualified? [looks at Kyle for a few seconds] Fight! Keep fighting! [the fighting continues, and two more umpires enter the picture] "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48224,Stan,"Come on, Dad! Get up! "
9,5,The Losing Edge,48239,Stan,Dad! [the guards let go and Randy turns around] You're the greatest. [Randy leaps for joy!] 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48241,Stan,"[impatiently tapping the table] Dude, where is she? We can't wait. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48245,Stan,Mom! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48250,Stan,[twirling around] I want a breast! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48254,Stan,"But Mom, we've been waiting for hours! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48257,Stan,All right. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48259,Stan,"Okay, this is everything, mom. [the boys return to their seats] "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48261,Stan,"Oh, boy! [they see the denuded chicken pieces. Stan looks at Cartman in anger] Cartman, you ate the skin off of EVERY PIECE OF CHICKEN! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48266,Stan,I can't believe that fat asshole! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48268,Stan,Well this time he's gone too far! 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48270,Stan,"Why do we even hang out with him, anyway? "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48272,Stan,"Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time! "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48274,Stan,"All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48279,Stan,I think I have extra. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48281,Stan,Here you go. 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48297,Stan,Cartman isn't our friend anymore. [throws the football back] 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48399,Stan,Who was that? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48401,Stan,"Dude, he did that to me this morning. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48405,Stan,"Yeah, we know better than to think that. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48506,Stan,Cartman? 
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48523,Stan,"Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did. "
9,6,The Death of Eric Cartman,48526,Stan,"Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow. "
9,7,Erection Day,48547,Stan,He's what?? [Kyle shrugs] 
9,7,Erection Day,48549,Stan,"A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall? [the kids begin moving out of the way, leaving Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] Maybe we should do the talent show. "
9,7,Erection Day,48552,Stan,"Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred-dollar first prize for the talent show. "
9,7,Erection Day,48719,Stan,"[bored, exchanges looks with Kyle] Woof. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48791,Stan,"Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48793,Stan,"Man, I wish I could really drive this thing. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48795,Stan,Sure I do! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48797,Stan,"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48799,Stan,"[reaches over and grabs the keys.] Okay, turn on the ignition, "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48801,Stan,Okay... [pulls on a handle] 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48803,Stan,"[pulls harder. The motor creates a froth of water behind the boat, which is still in place] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48805,Stan,"Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! [presses that and the boat lunges out of its landing, spinning around a few times as it jumps another dock nearby. The boat goes forward in a haphazard manner. Both boys scream] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48807,Stan,"[pushes the handle forward again, but it breaks in his hand. He can no longer control the boat, so he and Cartman scream again, then] Jesus Christ!!! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48809,Stan,Oh dude! Oh Jesus! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48811,Stan,You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48813,Stan,What? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48815,Stan,"Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48831,Stan,Huh oh. [puts his hands to his cheeks. Shelly gives him a funny look] 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48837,Stan,"Mom, Dad? [hesitating] The, they're gonna go help those people, right? "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48840,Stan,"Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right? "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48844,Stan,"Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night? "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48846,Stan,You saw all those people trapped on their roofs? 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48848,Stan,"Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48850,Stan,But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48852,Stan,Maybe they couldn't get out! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48854,Stan,"Dude, ah I just... [walks around in a fog of worry] ah I don't know what to do here. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48859,Stan,"[looks at Cartman, then] Nothing. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48884,Stan,"Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48903,Stan,"Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48914,Stan,"Kyle, it... it isn't global warming. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48916,Stan,"[hops off his cot] Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48918,Stan,"Because, I know what did cause the flood. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48920,Stan,No. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48922,Stan,No. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48924,Stan,No. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48926,Stan,No. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48928,Stan,...sort of. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48930,Stan,"[pulls him aside to a more private area] Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48935,Stan,"Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48938,Stan,"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48965,Stan,"Uh, hey Dad. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48967,Stan,"Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48969,Stan,"No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,48971,Stan,"Nothing. Can you just come get us, please? "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49005,Stan,We have to find a way out! [the boys start climbing the metal stairs] 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49010,Stan,"Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! [another drom falls near Kyle, shearing off the stairs they just climbed. Kyle falls on his ass and gets up] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49012,Stan,"[stops before an opening in the wall, where he sees sky and...] It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! [Kyle and Cartman are on a landing below. Kyle tries to catch up to Stan, but Cartman blocks his way] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49020,Stan,"[drops down a few steps and calls] Guys, come on! [goes back up the stairs] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49044,Stan,"[steps forward] Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. [the crowd falls silent for a few seconds] "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49048,Stan,No. I broke the dam. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49052,Stan,No. I broke the dam. 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49058,Stan,"[annoyed that his admission isn't taking hold, adds emphasis] I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it. "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49063,Stan,No! I broke the fucking dam! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49066,Stan,I literally broke the dam! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49069,Stan,On a boat! That wasn't mine! 
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49072,Stan,"I kept it secret, for two days! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49075,Stan,"The boat caught on fire, and it exploded! "
9,8,Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow,49078,Stan,"Ohhh, fuck it! "
9,9,Marjorine,49082,Stan,"Yeah, us too. "
9,9,Marjorine,49086,Stan,What? 
9,9,Marjorine,49117,Stan,"Oh my God, how does it know the answer? "
9,9,Marjorine,49128,Stan,So what do you suggest? 
9,9,Marjorine,49130,Stan,"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party. "
9,9,Marjorine,49134,Stan,"But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went. "
9,9,Marjorine,49203,Stan,"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house. "
9,9,Marjorine,49210,Stan,"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started. "
9,9,Marjorine,49256,Stan,Maybe they found him out. 
9,9,Marjorine,49258,Stan,"Come on, we gotta go check on him. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny move towards the house, reaching the storm cellar.] "
9,9,Marjorine,49260,Stan,He's just dancing around. 
9,9,Marjorine,49286,Stan,"Come on, Butters. "
9,9,Marjorine,49311,Stan,Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it. 
9,9,Marjorine,49323,Stan,"Guys, guys, guys, stop! [everyone goes silent] Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now. "
9,9,Marjorine,49325,Stan,We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back? 
9,9,Marjorine,49328,Stan,And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power. 
9,9,Marjorine,49331,Stan,"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are. "
9,9,Marjorine,49336,Stan,"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. [Kenny presses the button, the device explodes, destroying the surrounding area; the explosion is seen from space. Cartman and Kenny get up covered in ashes] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49367,Stan,"[worried] Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49370,Stan,"So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49372,Stan,Kyle?? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49401,Stan,"So, what are you and Wendy doing? "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49403,Stan,Uh huh... 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49405,Stan,"Yeah, well, so is your hat. [hangs up and sets the phone down. Kyle is puzzled, Stan is upset. The doorbell rings and Stan goes to answer it] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49407,Stan,I can't. I'm busy. 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49409,Stan,...So take it with you! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49411,Stan,"[crosses his arms, turns around and goes inside] Well, maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay, Bebe?! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49439,Stan,[points at Kyle] HA! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49453,Stan," Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49455,Stan,[suspicious] Why do you say that? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49457,Stan,That's because I was pissed off! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49469,Stan,"You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! [hops off the chair and rushes out the side door] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49479,Stan,"[determined, willful] Fine! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49481,Stan,No problems at all! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49483,Stan,"It's right there, see? [leans towards Kyle in fear. Wendy looks down and away from the action] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49535,Stan,"Day five. I made it! [the phone rings, and he answers] Hello? "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49538,Stan,What? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49540,Stan,Governor's office? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49542,Stan,"Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49544,Stan,"What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49546,Stan,You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49548,Stan,"Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say ""See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."" [a laser dot snakes its way up the egg. Stan notices this with some surprise, and the egg explodes in his hand. Some of it lands on his face and cap. Jakartha appears behind the bushes across the street and lowers his sniper rifle] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49550,Stan,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49552,Stan,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49555,Stan,"[softly crying, muffled] Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49557,Stan,"Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49559,Stan,I don't. She's totally lame. [he drops his head into his arms again.] 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49561,Stan,"[hops off his chair and approaches Kyle, head down] I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have. "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49563,Stan,Huh? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49565,Stan,That... [walks up to Kyle and points at the egg] That's the real egg with Garrison's signature? 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49567,Stan,Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49569,Stan,"Come on, buddy, let's go! [walks happily towards his door. Kyle steps forward, then stops] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49571,Stan,"[walks back and puts his left hand on Kyle's shoulder] As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known. [Kyle smiles and Stan pats him twice on the back] Come on! [they head out] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49588,Stan,"There! Over there! [they run through the crowd, taking care the egg doesn't fall out and break] Excuse us! Excuse us please! "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49590,Stan,Jesus Christ! 
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49595,Stan,"[tired, voice breaking] Teacher, our egg is... okay. [falls onto his back and passes out, holding the egg high for all to see] "
9,10,Follow That Egg!,49604,Stan,"[smugly] Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. [Wendy's face falls, then she turns and walks away sadly.] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49625,Stan,"Dude, what's the big deal? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49627,Stan,[thinks a moment] What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger. 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49636,Stan,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49654,Stan,You buying school lunch today? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49661,Stan,"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49665,Stan,"Sure, for what? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49668,Stan,"Okay dude, knock him out. [Kyle takes out a small club and beats Cartman with it once. He looks at him angrily. His short temper got the best of him and starts beating him more. After five blows Stan rushes over to stop him] Dude, dude okay, he's out! [with the club gone, Kyle resorts to punching Cartman out] Kyle, that's good! [Kenny puts his ear to the door and listens for any activity in the hallway] All right, let's do it. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49692,Stan,"You mean,you're a ginger? "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49703,Stan,"Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. [Butters strokes his nose, then takes out a napkin to wipe away tears from the laughter, then sighs, only to resume laughing, harder. Cartman just folds his arms across his chest and looks away] "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49746,Stan,Should we tell him the truth? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49783,Stan,Huh? Why? 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49787,Stan,... totally. 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49789,Stan,"You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49792,Stan,You guys... need... anything? [long silence] 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49794,Stan,"More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49796,Stan,The hell do they want? [A redhead comes in from the right side and snatches Kenny away] 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49799,Stan,"Run, dude, run!! "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49821,Stan,"Kyle. Kyle, wake up. "
9,11,Ginger Kids,49823,Stan,I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton. 
9,11,Ginger Kids,49825,Stan,Cartman? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49869,Stan,I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49874,Stan,"[stops] No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys. [the others stop and he catches up] Let's just do something fun that's free. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49877,Stan,Well I can't spend any money. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49881,Stan,"[stops, thinks, and looks] Excuse me? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49883,Stan,Uh what do I have to do? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49888,Stan,Fine. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49891,Stan,"L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49893,Stan,"Then how come that sign says ""Church of Scientology""? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49895,Stan,Seven and two. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49897,Stan,"Uhhh, sh-sure? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49899,Stan,Yeah? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49901,Stan,Yes. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49903,Stan,So how did I do? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49905,Stan,...Huh?? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49907,Stan,I am?? I didn't know that! 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49909,Stan,What what do I do? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49913,Stan,I'm totally depressed. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49915,Stan,I don't know. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49917,Stan,I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49919,Stan,"No, I found a self-help program that can cure me. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49921,Stan,But I'm completely miserable and these people can help! 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49923,Stan,Neither did I! 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49925,Stan,"Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa?? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49928,Stan,[looking real sad] ...well but... but that's my money. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49933,Stan,I hope so. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49936,Stan,Really? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49938,Stan,Thetan levels... 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49940,Stan,"So, this is gonna make me happy? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49942,Stan,What? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49945,Stan,Stan. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49967,Stan,I took out the garbage yesterday. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49969,Stan,Aagh! [hauls the garbage bag out of the garbage can and drags it across the living room] Stupid dumb garbage! [opens the front door and steps out.] 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49975,Stan,"I don't know! [a Scientology helicopter lands on the lawn and some officials open the door for the church's president, who exits, walks over to Stan, and kneels down] "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49988,Stan,[enters his room] Jesus Christ... 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49990,Stan,"Aw dude, I need to go to bed. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49992,Stan,"Yeah, I know who you are. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49994,Stan,"Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49996,Stan,"I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,49998,Stan,"Hey! [walks over to the closet] Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50000,Stan,"Dude, this is my room! "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50002,Stan,[walks out into the hall] Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet! 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50004,Stan,"Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. [Randy enters the room and tries to open the closet door, then knocks. Stan looks on] "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50010,Stan,I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50029,Stan,Sure. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50034,Stan,"I, I guess. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50042,Stan,But I don't know any of this stuff. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50044,Stan,"Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50058,Stan,"[gets an idea] Yeah, yeah! "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50060,Stan,I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50062,Stan,"Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50064,Stan,I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50066,Stan,"I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning! "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50068,Stan,"Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! [Kyle and Kenny leave] "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50088,Stan,"I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50090,Stan,And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50092,Stan,"And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologists should no longer have to pay money to belong. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50094,Stan,"I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50096,Stan,"... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50098,Stan,But you said that there were- 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50100,Stan,"But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly? "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50102,Stan,Three million dollars? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50104,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I get you. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50116,Stan,"Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50119,Stan,"And uh, oh, [hopeful faces look back at him] ...I ...I can't do this. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50121,Stan,"Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything. "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50124,Stan,[takes off his laurel] I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam. 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50126,Stan,What?? 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50128,Stan,YOU told me it was a lie! 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50135,Stan,Well fine! Go ahead and sue me! 
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50138,Stan,"Well go on, then! Sue me! "
9,12,Trapped in the Closet,50140,Stan,"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me! "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50150,Stan,"[reading the park map] Okay, where to next? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50156,Stan,"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50180,Stan,What? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50195,Stan,I don't believe it. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50202,Stan,Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50212,Stan,It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50221,Stan,"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50224,Stan,"Craig, Token, get the slings ready. [Cartman, Clyde, and a third boy position a ladder into place. Jambu swims over to see what's happening.] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50263,Stan,What happened? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50267,Stan,They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy. 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50315,Stan,"Uh, excuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... [enunciates] Aeronautica y Spacia Administra-tio-n? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50317,Stan,Thanks. [they leave and arrive at MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración] 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50319,Stan,"Is this the Mexican space program? [again, neglected beauty, and the place looks quite primitive for a space administration, straight out of the 1950s.] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50321,Stan,Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50325,Stan,This rocket will fly to the moon? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50327,Stan,To the moon? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50329,Stan,[enunciates] We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50331,Stan,Two hundred? Million? 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50333,Stan,"[to Craig] Quick, call Kyle. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50395,Stan,"They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready? "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50408,Stan,[to the ALF leader] Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go! 
9,13,Free Willzyx,50411,Stan,"Kyle, it's all set to go! [the ALF van rolls in] Just get Willzy-x into the water! [some ALF officers emerge from the van.] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50419,Stan,"Okay, Manuel, hit it. [Manuel presses the launch button] "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50429,Stan,"Thanks for the ride, Manuel. "
9,13,Free Willzyx,50435,Stan,I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50459,Stan,[looks around] Wait. Where's my Dad? 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50461,Stan,Yeah. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50463,Stan,Dad? Where the hell could he have gone?? 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50467,Stan,"Dad, weren't you watching? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50472,Stan,"Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50476,Stan,Why not just pull over? 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50478,Stan,"Dad, we're gonna crash! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50484,Stan,"Aww, it's all warm! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50507,Stan,[still not looking] This is sooo embarrassing. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50512,Stan,"Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50514,Stan,"Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50517,Stan,Oh Jesus. [puts his hands over his eyes out of embarrassment. Mrs. Garrison sits at her chair] 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50545,Stan,Dad! What the hell are you doing?! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50547,Stan,"Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50549,Stan,What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50551,Stan,"Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50553,Stan,"Aww, Goddammit! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50555,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50557,Stan,No! You don't need another beer! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50559,Stan,"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50578,Stan,"Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50581,Stan,"Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50583,Stan,"No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50585,Stan,"No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50587,Stan,"No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50589,Stan,"Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while. [he is promptly kicked out] Goddammit! [walks off] "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50596,Stan,"[rushes up] Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50598,Stan,"Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50600,Stan,"[stays quiet, then] What?? "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50602,Stan,"Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50604,Stan,... I'm eight! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50608,Stan,Where? I can't see. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50614,Stan,[covers his eyes] Oh my God... 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50616,Stan,"Dad, let's just wait our turn. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50624,Stan,"I just, my dad was- "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50628,Stan,What?! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50630,Stan,"No, Dad, people will see! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50636,Stan,"[gets into position to move the wheelchair to the back of the line] Dad, we're going back! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50644,Stan,Praise Christ. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50647,Stan,"Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50654,Stan,"No, my dad doesn't drink. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50678,Stan,"Dad, Dad, Stop! "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50680,Stan,"Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50682,Stan,"Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50684,Stan,No! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50686,Stan,"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50688,Stan,"Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. [Randy looks at Stan for a moment, then walks up to his side and kneels next to him.] "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50690,Stan,I've had a great teacher. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50692,Stan,"No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart. "
9,14,Bloody Mary,50694,Stan,All right! 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50696,Stan,That's probably okay if you spread it out. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50698,Stan,I think you're pushing it. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50700,Stan,That's not disciprine. 
9,14,Bloody Mary,50702,Stan,Dad! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50704,Stan,"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. [the others look up at him] "

10,1,The Return of Chef,50821,Stan,"Well look, he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50843,Stan,NO!!

10,1,The Return of Chef,50851,Stan,Knew what? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50856,Stan,"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50864,Stan,"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50866,Stan,"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50879,Stan,Having sex with women.

10,1,The Return of Chef,50893,Stan,"Come on guys, we might as well go. [the boys prepare to leave. The obese stripper can move, though, and Chef is interested. He drops the blonde off and approaches the stage] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50895,Stan,"Chef, we're leaving. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50899,Stan,He's remembering.

10,1,The Return of Chef,50921,Stan,Immortal? 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50925,Stan,"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50927,Stan,We're not leaving without Chef. 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50934,Stan,"[to one of the guards] No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50944,Stan,"[rushes up to Chef] Come on, Chef! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50955,Stan,We made it! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50957,Stan,"Chef, come on! "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50961,Stan,"[softly] Chef, we love you. "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50968,Stan,"NO! [Chef struggles to get up, but can't move. A mountain lion leaps down into view] "
10,1,The Return of Chef,50976,Stan,Oh my God...They killed Chef! 
10,1,The Return of Chef,50982,Stan,"Come on, let's go. "

10,2,Smug Alert!,51116,Stan,"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs! "
10,2,Smug Alert!,51118,Stan,"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that without Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow. "

10,2,Smug Alert!,51151,Stan,Yeah. 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51153,Stan,Ow! 
10,2,Smug Alert!,51155,Stan,What?!

10,6,ManBearPig,52108,Stan,"Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52114,Stan,"Oh, hey Dad. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52121,Stan,"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52126,Stan,"He could be half bear, half manpig. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52128,Stan,"But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52130,Stan,Hello? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52132,Stan,[shuts his eyes and covers them with his left hand] Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.

10,6,ManBearPig,52142,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52144,Stan,"...Yes, I'm serial. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52149,Stan,"Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. [the door opens and Al Gore greats the boys] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52151,Stan,"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52153,Stan,NO. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52155,Stan,"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52187,Stan,"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52190,Stan,Oh no! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52200,Stan,Help! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52206,Stan,Help! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52210,Stan,[faces Cartman] Me?? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52212,Stan,Maybe there's another way out of here. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52224,Stan,"[returning] There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. [Cartman arrives] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52229,Stan,Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52245,Stan,I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52249,Stan,Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52268,Stan,"Dude, he's really sick. [Cartman has moved on to swallowing necklaces and loose gemstones] "
10,6,ManBearPig,52277,Stan,[wakes up and rubs his eyes] Huh? What? Have they come for us? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52280,Stan,"Oh my God. [runs up to Cartman] Cartman? Dude, can you hear me? "
10,6,ManBearPig,52283,Stan,"How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere. "
10,6,ManBearPig,52289,Stan,"Goddamnit, he's soo heavy! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52292,Stan,Cartman? 
10,6,ManBearPig,52298,Stan,"[exhausted] I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52311,Stan,"Kenny! Here, take my hand! [Kenny does so and makes it to safety. A change of POV shows Kyle hauling Cartman] Hurry Kyle, the water's rising! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52319,Stan,Kyle! No! 
10,6,ManBearPig,52324,Stan,Agh. 
10,6,ManBearPig,52329,Stan,"Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!! "
10,6,ManBearPig,52333,Stan,"Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor. "
10,7,Tsst,52528,Stan,[takes his turn] You can't stay here. 
10,7,Tsst,52610,Stan,"Dude, have you lost more weight? "
10,7,Tsst,52614,Stan,"Dude, we're not killing your mom. "
10,7,Tsst,52616,Stan,Where am I supposed to get a gun? 
10,7,Tsst,52618,Stan,I'm not shooting anybody. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52661,Stan,"[the blue knight, with sword and shield] Dude! We've been waiting forever! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52669,Stan,"H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52672,Stan,What?! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52674,Stan,"[swivels around to face his dad] I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52677,Stan,"All right, sorry guys. So where to now? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52682,Stan,"[stops and motions] Oh crap! It's that guy again! [a player approaches them and begins to dance. The character is wearing a helmet, boots, elbow-length gloves, and tight shorts. No shirt, no other armor] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52684,Stan,This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52686,Stan,He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52688,Stan,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52696,Stan,"[head resting on left hand] Whoever he is, he is one tough badass. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52701,Stan,"Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52703,Stan,Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52736,Stan,"Dude, we have to try. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52767,Stan,"Come on, let's do this! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52771,Stan,Look! There he is! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52783,Stan,Dad?? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52785,Stan,"Dad, get off our teamspeak line! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52787,Stan,"[the ganker kills him. He throws off his headset again] That's it, screw this game! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52800,Stan,"Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52804,Stan,We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52842,Stan,I'm in. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52848,Stan, +15 agility. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52850,Stan,'K.

10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52860,Stan,"Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52866,Stan,"Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52886,Stan,"Kyle! [Kyle leaves his desk grabbing onto his right hand, then flexes his right wrist around. Stan leaves his desk and approaches him] Kyle! Dude, what's wrong? "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52888,Stan,"Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! [Cartman walks over] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52890,Stan,Hurry dude! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52892,Stan,"Kyle, you have to keep playing. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52894,Stan,We can't do this without you now! Come on! [he and Cartman help Kyle back to his computer] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52920,Stan,"You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52931,Stan,"Dude, I'm almost dead. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52935,Stan,[his character leaves the battle] I've gotta heal. [his character turns to see the battle] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52937,Stan,Dad? Not now! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52939,Stan,"Dad, how did you get that?! "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52941,Stan,Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I... 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52944,Stan,I got it! [the ganker stabs Randy and Randy goes down] 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52946,Stan,Dad! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52948,Stan,"Dad, no! [turns around to face the ganker] You killed my father. [walks up to the ganker and strikes him with one blow of the sword. The ganker's defenses start to crack.] "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52954,Stan,Dad? Dad? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52956,Stan,"I know you do, Dad. "
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52966,Stan,We did it! 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52969,Stan,Yeah. 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52975,Stan,I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now? 
10,8,"Make Love, Not Warcraft",52979,Stan,Got it. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,52984,Stan,A wall toilet for peeing in. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53011,Stan,Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53019,Stan,"Yeah, at least one-fourth. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53095,Stan,[appears suddenly in the living room] Kyle! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53097,Stan,"Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys [looks around] are coming to my house and questioning me about you?? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53099,Stan,Well why did you have to involve me?? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53101,Stan,"All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53103,Stan,"Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you. [moves off, then stops and turns around] There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53105,Stan,[mulls it over] That's all I needed. [turns around and heads for the back door. Kyle follows.] 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53112,Stan,"Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53118,Stan,"Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53150,Stan,JESUS CHRIST!! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53154,Stan,He was right. You DID cause 9/11. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53157,Stan,Why?! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53161,Stan,[off on a different page] Is the whole government in on this? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53165,Stan,[seeing their chance] Kyle! Run! [the boys take off with the Secret Service in hot pursuit] 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53170,Stan,"All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude. [next scene is another city, somewhere] We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53172,Stan,"Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time. "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53174,Stan,"Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? [Kyle stops and turns around] "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53182,Stan,What who said? 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53185,Stan,Oh God! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53191,Stan,Who are you?

10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53211,Stan,"How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do! "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53213,Stan,It was all planned out! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53215,Stan,Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53217,Stan,The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal! 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53220,Stan,"[lowers his pistol] Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries? "
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53222,Stan,Yuh. 
10,9,Mystery of the Urinal Deuce,53224,Stan,Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.

10,10,Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy,53376,Stan,"Dude, I really don't see a problem. "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53565,Stan,"Go ahead, Kyle, do it. "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53693,Stan,[rushes into the living room with the other boys] Dad! Dad! 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53695,Stan,"If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right?? "
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53713,Stan,It does work!! 
10,11,Hell on Earth 2006,53769,Stan,"We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls. "
10,12,Go God Go,53852,Stan,It's still three weeks. 
10,12,Go God Go,53872,Stan,"Dude you don't look so good, Cartman. "
10,12,Go God Go,53878,Stan,Do what? 
10,12,Go God Go,53884,Stan,"Dude, no way. "
10,12,Go God Go,54010,Stan,Well there could still be a god. 
10,12,Go God Go,54012,Stan,Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why? 
10,12,Go God Go,54014,Stan,"I wasn't talking about spaghetti. [Mrs. Garrison picks him up, desk and all, and carries him to the front of the class.] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54383,Stan,"I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54385,Stan,"[insistent] My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. [behind him, outside the window, a tow truck pulls up] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54387,Stan,Yeah. Why? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54389,Stan,"[turns around] What?? [walks to the door and looks out its window, then leaves the office while the driver locks the bike in place] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54391,Stan,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?! "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54393,Stan,Yes! 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54395,Stan,"No-dude, I need my bike to do my job! "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54397,Stan,"[climbs up the door towards the driver] No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike! [the truck moves forward and Stan hops off. He moves towards the bike.] Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! [catches up to the bike and grabs one of the pedals, but that just jerks him up and down a few times as the wheel on the ground moves the pedals. Stan hits the ground several times, getting bruised until he finally lets go of the pedal and rests on the street. He looks on helplessly as the truck keeps moving and his bike disappears in the distance] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54400,Stan,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to- "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54402,Stan,"I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54404,Stan,"[several seconds later] Look, I really need my bike. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54406,Stan,What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair! 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54408,Stan,...Yeah? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54410,Stan,[apprehensive] Me? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54413,Stan,"Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here. [the kids move towards him, tumbling. Stan decides to go in and meet them] We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54415,Stan,My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our- 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54417,Stan,"All right, fine, go ahead. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54419,Stan,"S- hold it a while, okay? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54421,Stan,When you shoot the puck to another player. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54425,Stan,"All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54427,Stan,Why not?! 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54429,Stan,"What, you got asthma or something? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54431,Stan,[off guard] What? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54434,Stan,"Ah, it's okay. Don't cry. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54437,Stan,"[feeling overwhelmed] Oh Jesus, can we just practice? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54439,Stan,NO! [a rival team and its coach walk up to Park County] 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54443,Stan,[steps forward to reply] Hey. [Coach Gavin withdraws his hand] 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54451,Stan,Jesus Christ. [his parents walk up to him] 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54454,Stan,I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54457,Stan,I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54459,Stan,"I'm not playing, I'm coaching. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54461,Stan,[tense] What are you talking about? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54463,Stan,[relaxes] I remember going to Shakey's afterwards. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54465,Stan,"[heads upstairs] I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. [Randy moves towards him a bit, but Stan's door closes, and Randy turns to Sharon] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54485,Stan,"[blows his whistle] All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54488,Stan,Oh 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54490,Stan,Ohhh. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54494,Stan,... I don't know. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54496,Stan,"No, I think you oughta. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54502,Stan,"[enters the room] Oh uh, hey Nelson. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54504,Stan,"Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54506,Stan,"Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54508,Stan,Ogh. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54510,Stan,"Goddammit, dude, I don't know. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54512,Stan,"No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54514,Stan,"Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? [gives him a thumbs up and walks away] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54516,Stan,"No- dude, I told you I can't do that. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54518,Stan,"Okay. [pause. He steps out of the room and closes the door. Behind the door is the judge, waiting. He has his record player with him. He starts playing it...] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54523,Stan,"[walks up to Gavin] Coach, can I talk to you for a second? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54525,Stan,"[takes him aside] Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54529,Stan,"All right, guys, listen. [turns around] I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. [the players look at each other] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54533,Stan,Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54543,Stan,"Let's go, Park! Come on! "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54546,Stan,"Get near the puck! [Park County players fall. No one is getting near the puck. No. 15, the goalie, continues picking his nose. Fast forward to the end of the third period. An Adams County player is struggling to keep his bladder in check. One second left in the game] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54548,Stan,"Tie? Well, what does that mean? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54552,Stan,Hello? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54554,Stan,How are you feeling? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54557,Stan,"Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54559,Stan,Oh boy. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54562,Stan,But what can I do? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54567,Stan,"Well, ah, I mean... "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54569,Stan,"Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54575,Stan,"Well, sure we can. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54577,Stan,"Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything? "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54579,Stan,They're not gonna kill us. 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54581,Stan,"[thinks a bit] Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54583,Stan,Hey that's right. We need a ringer. [smiles] 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54588,Stan,"It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. [Ike is wearing #2] "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54593,Stan,"Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now. "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54597,Stan,"[at an entrance with his team] All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?! [all the players are with him in their own ways.] All right, let's go win! "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54599,Stan,Huh? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54602,Stan,S-so then we win? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54604,Stan,"Hey. Hey, you can't do this. [the Avs come up behind Park County] We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap! "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54606,Stan,But it isn't supposed to end like this! 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54612,Stan,[turns around and face the Avs] Play the Red Wings? 
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54620,Stan,"Jesus Christ! [another Red Wing takes the puck to the goal, but kicks another Park County player into the plastic off to the side] Stop! Stop this! "
10,14,Stanley's Cup,54625,Stan,"Hey, can they do that?? "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54665,Stan,[covers his eyes] Ooooh. [Sharon and Shelly are stunned] 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54676,Stan,"Can we just drop this, please? I don't wanna talk about it! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54678,Stan,"No, he's not. [looks at Kyle] Is he? "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54680,Stan,"I just need to explain things. [walks up to Tolkien, who's finished with the locker and holds only a binder in his right hand] Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but- "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54682,Stan,"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay? "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54687,Stan,"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54690,Stan,"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54715,Stan,Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson. 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54717,Stan,"Well, yeah. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54719,Stan,"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54721,Stan,[softly] He told my dad he was... 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54773,Stan,"Token! Hey, wait up. [Tolkien turns around] I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N-word. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54775,Stan,Goddamn it! 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54831,Stan,"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad! "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54833,Stan,I'm not responsible for what my dad did! 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54835,Stan,"What the hell do you want from me?! [Butters appears across the street, rather out of breath. Upon seeing them, he runs over] "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54837,Stan,Then stop being mad! 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54876,Stan,What was his point? 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54878,Stan,"Dude, I don't get it. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54880,Stan,[comes to a certain realization] Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it. 
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54882,Stan,"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it! [smiles, then walks up to Tolkien] Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it. "
11,1,With Apologies to Jesse Jackson,54884,Stan,[smiles] Yeah. I totally don't get it. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54896,Stan,"Come on, let's go. [leads Kyle and Kenny out the door.] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54912,Stan,What'cha do to Butters this time? 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54916,Stan,"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him? "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54926,Stan,You are now. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54930,Stan,You can't! 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54994,Stan,"Because it's really, really funny. "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,54998,Stan,That isn't funny. 
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55020,Stan,"Aw man, I've got H O R S now. [steps aside as Kenny receives the ball.] "
11,2,Cartman Sucks,55026,Stan,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55196,Stan,[looks to Kyle] What do you think happens if you do have it? 
11,3,Lice Capades,55268,Stan,Somebody in this class? 
11,3,Lice Capades,55301,Stan,You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere! 
11,3,Lice Capades,55311,Stan,Yeah... Or you. [they check out each other] 
11,3,Lice Capades,55417,Stan,"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice. [walks up to him] Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?! "
11,3,Lice Capades,55420,Stan,You had head lice? 
11,4,The Snuke,55601,Stan,"Dude, we totally got let out of school. "
11,4,The Snuke,55603,Stan,Russian? 
11,4,The Snuke,55605,Stan,So he's a Hillary Clinton fan. 
11,4,The Snuke,55607,Stan,Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere. 
11,4,The Snuke,55641,Stan,You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. [CIA agents enter the room quickly with their equipment] 
11,4,The Snuke,55684,Stan,"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger! "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55802,Stan,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55804,Stan,"Right, so, why do we color eggs? [Shelly makes a cross face] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55806,Stan,"Yeah, but why? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55808,Stan,So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55810,Stan,"You don't see the missteps in logic with that? [Randy is unfazed, while Shelly, Sharon, and Marvin look at Stan disapprovingly] Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information. "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55812,Stan,[leaves his seat] I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55823,Stan,"All right, can you explain to me what's going on? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55825,Stan,What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross? [no reply] It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times? [nudges him] Answer me! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55827,Stan,I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55829,Stan,"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! [hops off and walks away] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55833,Stan,Mom? Dad? [reaches the second floor] Anybody home? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55835,Stan,Dad! You've gotta help me! [looks around] 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55837,Stan,Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55839,Stan,"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want! [hears the front door breaking open] They're coming in! Dad, open the door! [the bathroom door opens and Randy looks out, wearing some bunny ears and a bunny snout with buck teeth.] Dad? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55847,Stan,Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55849,Stan,"[not impressed, but curious] Does Mom know about this? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55851,Stan,I don't understand! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55853,Stan,"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55855,Stan,So what is the secret of Easter? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55859,Stan,Grandpa's in it too? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55861,Stan,"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55863,Stan,"You mean the old Galveston Lodge? [Randy's taken aback at Stan's memory and so thinks about what to do next. After a while, he decides to remove the bag] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55872,Stan,Must I? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55874,Stan,Hi Grandpa. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55876,Stan,...Stan. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55883,Stan,Yeah. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55885,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna know already. "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55891,Stan,Where am I supposed to go? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55897,Stan,Jesus Christ! [a monk has Randy restrained] 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55899,Stan,"Oh no... [looks around, then runs off] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55901,Stan,Help. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55903,Stan,My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55905,Stan,"[enters anyway] Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me! [turns around and fires off a few questions] Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs? "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55918,Stan,Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? [the professor stops and turns around] 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55920,Stan,[the butler steps aside] My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55924,Stan,Just bread... 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55929,Stan,He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55935,Stan,He looks like a guy. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55939,Stan,[looks at the professor] But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55955,Stan,I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball? 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55958,Stan,They found me! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55965,Stan,If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants. 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55967,Stan,"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us! [softly] Wait... unless... maybe there is. [hands Snowball to Kyle] Here, hold this. [walks some distance away from Kyle and prays] Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. [waits for a long time, then peeks with his right eye, then with both, but there's no sign of Jesus. He opens his eyes wide, as normal, and looks up. Kyle looks down at Snowball] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55980,Stan,"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go! "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55984,Stan,"Okay, fine. [a cardinal takes Snowball from Stan, and Randy is released] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55986,Stan,"You said ""hand over the bunny."" "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,55989,Stan,"Hey, what the hell! "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56003,Stan,"Jesus, you did answer my prayer! [grins] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56017,Stan,"No! No! [Stan and Randy are taken away in one direction, Kyle and Jesus in another, Benedict in still another] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56044,Stan,"Snowball! [now dressed in rabbits ears and snout like Randy. A bright light appears near one of the obelisks in the center of the piazza, and Jesus' figure appears in the light. The light fades and Jesus is all alone. The crowd oohs and aahs] "
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56052,Stan,All right Jesus! 
11,5,Fantastic Easter Special,56058,Stan,Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut. 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56065,Stan,"Uh oh, this isn't good. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56067,Stan,[frightened] No ma'am. 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56070,Stan,"Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56075,Stan,"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay? "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56079,Stan,We don't? 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56096,Stan,"Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that. "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56150,Stan,"That's it, that's the whole story? "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56166,Stan,"You guys, school starts in ten minutes! "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56169,Stan,"[sees Clyde] Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde! [Clyde turns around] You didn't finish your essay either, right? "
11,6,D-Yikes!,56180,Stan,Again? 
11,6,D-Yikes!,56344,Stan,These guys are pretty good. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56349,Stan,"[stops] Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people? [all around the basketball court homeless people loiter or sleep. There's one bum sleeping at center court. The boys walk up to him] Sir, could you move a little, please? "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56353,Stan,"Well dude, what are we supposed to do? "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56361,Stan,"Yeah, it's all set. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56368,Stan,"That was a sweet idea, Kyle. [smiles] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56392,Stan,"Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house? "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56397,Stan,"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56403,Stan,"Kyle, what were you thinking? "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56435,Stan,"Dude, it's our dads. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56445,Stan,"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. [the boys turn off the TV and head outside] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56451,Stan,Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56457,Stan,"Over here! [Kyle looks back. Cartman and Kenny drop down into the sewer and Kyle walks to the manhole.] Jump down! Go! [Kyle drops down, and finally, Stan] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56461,Stan,"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. [they move forward.] "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56478,Stan,Are you the head of Homeless Studies? 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56480,Stan,We think this may be our friend's fault. [shows Kyle] He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday- 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56482,Stan,There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them. 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56489,Stan,"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56564,Stan,What the hell happened here? [three men in camouflage appear and aim their shotguns at them] 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56566,Stan,"We, just came to ask a question. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56570,Stan,"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem. "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56578,Stan,"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56584,Stan,What? 
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56587,Stan,"[getting off the bench] But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56599,Stan,"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56601,Stan,"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle! "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56613,Stan,"All right, I'm turning around "
11,7,Night of the Living Homeless,56642,Stan,"Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle. "
11,9,More Crap,56928,Stan,No way! 
11,9,More Crap,56930,Stan,"No, never. [Shelly wanders in and looks in the toilet] "
11,9,More Crap,57022,Stan,"Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready. "
11,9,More Crap,57024,Stan,"Gee, thanks a lot, Dad. "
11,9,More Crap,57033,Stan,"You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. [turns around and walks in] "
11,9,More Crap,57086,Stan,"Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please? "
11,9,More Crap,57089,Stan,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap. "
11,9,More Crap,57091,Stan,That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one? 
11,9,More Crap,57093,Stan,"Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold. "
11,9,More Crap,57095,Stan,"[a bit shocked] Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off? "
11,9,More Crap,57097,Stan,"All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2. "
11,9,More Crap,57099,Stan,Agh! 
11,9,More Crap,57101,Stan,I take it back! 
11,9,More Crap,57103,Stan,You're not number two! 
11,9,More Crap,57105,Stan,What is wrong with that guy? 
11,9,More Crap,57111,Stan,What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?! 
11,9,More Crap,57113,Stan,So Bono's newest record is a lie! 
11,9,More Crap,57115,Stan,So? 
11,9,More Crap,57117,Stan,He's the record. 
11,9,More Crap,57132,Stan,"[runs in] Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours. "
11,9,More Crap,57135,Stan,Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record! 
11,9,More Crap,57144,Stan,Dude. 
11,9,More Crap,57148,Stan,"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit. "
11,9,More Crap,57154,Stan,"Dad, are you all right? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57180,Stan,Dude... 
11,10,Imaginationland,57184,Stan,Cool. 
11,10,Imaginationland,57191,Stan,"[""Where'd he go? [the leprechaun appears on a tree limb behind the boys they turn to look at him again] ""]"
11,10,Imaginationland,57225,Stan,"[walks up to him] Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place? "
11,10,Imaginationland,57228,Stan,...What do you know about the leprechaun? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57232,Stan,Who the hell are you? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57239,Stan,"Come on, guys. [the others follow him, with Butters trailing.] "
11,10,Imaginationland,57246,Stan,What is this place? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57253,Stan,[hesitantly] Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a- 
11,10,Imaginationland,57262,Stan,Butters. 
11,10,Imaginationland,57270,Stan,[picks up] Hello? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57272,Stan,No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57274,Stan,Yeah! How'd you know? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57277,Stan,Why? 
11,10,Imaginationland,57352,Stan,"Dude, do you really have to do it? "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57379,Stan,What is this place? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57406,Stan,"Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57410,Stan,"Dude, we don't remember. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57415,Stan,No. 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57418,Stan,Your what? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57427,Stan,"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us? "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57437,Stan,That's not very imaginative. 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57447,Stan,The Imagination song? 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57455,Stan, Imagina-he-hey-   
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57457,Stan,"[to General Deckter] Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57495,Stan,"Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation. "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57543,Stan,"Dude, you did make a deal... [Kyle has run out of appeals and reluctantly follows Cartman out] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57569,Stan,"Wait, woodland critters... [begins searching his memory] "
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57571,Stan,Get them out of there! 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57573,Stan,Tell them to get away now! 
11,11,"Imaginationland, Episode II",57618,Stan,"KYLE!! [a fading tech pushes the red button at his station as he drops to the floor. Lightning flashes into the room as a tractor beam pulls Stan into the portal. ManBearPig resists the pull, but crushes Kyle in its left hand for several seconds] "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57676,Stan,[in Kyle's head] Hello? [Kyle's eyes open and blink] Hello? Anybody? [Kyle's eyes dart around] 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57678,Stan,Hello? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57737,Stan,Hello? Can anybody hear me? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57739,Stan,"Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57741,Stan,...Oh that makes sense. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57743,Stan,[walking down the rainbow road] I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye. [some moaning horns are heard] Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57762,Stan,Kyle? What's happening? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57764,Stan,What?! You can't let them do that! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57766,Stan,"Dude you have to stall them! [Kyle doesn't look too sure] Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57812,Stan,"No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57815,Stan,"[stands next to Butters] No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57818,Stan,So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again. 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57820,Stan,The Chosen One? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57851,Stan,"[in Kyle's imagination] Kyle? Kyle, what happened? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57853,Stan,What?? 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57855,Stan,"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke! "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57857,Stan,Well you have to convince them they are real! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57859,Stan,"Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?! [Kyle sighs] Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you. "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57911,Stan,[approaches] Kyle! 
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57919,Stan,"Dude! How did you do that, Butters? "
11,12,"Imaginationland, Episode III",57925,Stan,Dude. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57958,Stan,"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! [a shot of the cheering CG crowd on the TV] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57963,Stan,"[irritated, interrupting] Dad? Dad! What are you doing?! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57966,Stan,"Yeah, that's stupid, Dad. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57970,Stan,"[turns back to the TV] Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. [the game starts up with a new song, and the boys behind them begin to cheer again] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57980,Stan,"Dude, we are total rock stars now! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57982,Stan,[takes off his controller and goes to answer the door] Hang on. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57984,Stan,Yeah? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57986,Stan,"Yeah, we did. [smiles] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57988,Stan,"Wow, really?? [smiles an open smile] Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,57992,Stan,That'd be awesome! 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58003,Stan,"Wow, this is a huge party. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58005,Stan,"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! [Ron Zappolo is shown - an elderly gent with gray hair and mustache] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58008,Stan,"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there! [a football player wearing #6 is shown] Quarterback for the Denver Broncos! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58011,Stan,Are you serious?? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58014,Stan,"Nice to meet you! [grins] I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58022,Stan,Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58027,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's almost impossible. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58031,Stan,Really? That'd be sweet. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58033,Stan,"What, you mean, Kyle? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58035,Stan,"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58043,Stan,"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58045,Stan,"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""? [Thad stops and launches into that song] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58051,Stan,"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58054,Stan,"This is um, Thad Jarvis. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58057,Stan,"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincade thinks I should play with Thad for a while. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58059,Stan,"I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58061,Stan,"Don't put this all on me, Kyle! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58063,Stan,"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,- "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58065,Stan,"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58068,Stan,"Let's just do this, all right? [a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58071,Stan,"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58073,Stan,[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide] Huh? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58075,Stan,Hero-Heroin Hero? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58077,Stan,And there's no score? No crowds? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58081,Stan,"[playing quietly] Dude, this is awesome. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58086,Stan,Ugh. Damnit. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58088,Stan,"[frustrated] Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! [misses some more notes] No no, you know what?! Screw this! [the music stops] I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58090,Stan,"Yeah? Well, I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58092,Stan,"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58094,Stan,"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58096,Stan,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58098,Stan,"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! [Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan's tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58100,Stan,Man... 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58102,Stan,"Just, just a little. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58104,Stan,"I know, but it mellows me out, okay?! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58106,Stan,No problem. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58124,Stan,"Huh? What, uh? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58126,Stan,The dragon. Where did it go? 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58143,Stan,"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58145,Stan,I just wanna find something else to play. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58147,Stan,"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58156,Stan,"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58158,Stan,"Please, it- it won't take long. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58160,Stan,"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. [""I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes""] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58162,Stan,"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58164,Stan,"That isn't it at all. [""Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand""] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58166,Stan,"I know. I need you. [Kyle glances over his shoulder, then turns around to face Stan] I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that... [turns around and face Kyle] ...with my best friend. "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58168,Stan,[awkwardly] Yeah. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58170,Stan,I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it. 
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58172,Stan,"What, you mean it? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58174,Stan,"[pats Kyle on the shoulder] Then let's go, dude! [walks forward. Kyle follows.] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58179,Stan,"All right, dude, let's do this. [Kyle's jaw drops and Stan is annoyed] What the hell? [what greets them is Randy on the couch in his underwear. Around him are a pizza slice, a bucket of chicken, a case of S'mores Schnapps, and other items. Randy is playing Heroin Hero] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58182,Stan,"Aw, Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58185,Stan,"No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero! "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58187,Stan,"You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! [turns off the console] "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58189,Stan,"Mom, will you get Dad out of here? "
11,13,Guitar Queer-O,58203,Stan,That's it? 
11,14,The List,58209,Stan,"Dude, Butters, calm down. "
11,14,The List,58216,Stan,"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account? "
11,14,The List,58263,Stan,It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one. 
11,14,The List,58265,Stan,"And then Tolkien, and then me. "
11,14,The List,58275,Stan,"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last. "
11,14,The List,58278,Stan,"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember? "
11,14,The List,58280,Stan,"Who cares what dumb girls think, right? [realizes there's no consolation now and walks away. Kyle stays there looking at the list. Alone. All alone. All alone in the boys' room] "
11,14,The List,58331,Stan,"Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you? "
11,14,The List,58333,Stan,"Just for a minute. Over here. [takes her aside, to a tree nearby] "
11,14,The List,58336,Stan,"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made. "
11,14,The List,58338,Stan,"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest? "
11,14,The List,58340,Stan,[walks up next to her] So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list. 
11,14,The List,58342,Stan,Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last? 
11,14,The List,58359,Stan,"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy? "
11,14,The List,58361,Stan,NO. 
11,14,The List,58385,Stan,I have no idea what you're talking about. 
11,14,The List,58393,Stan,"That didn't sparkle with her, did it? "
11,14,The List,58412,Stan,What's going on? 
11,14,The List,58419,Stan,"Jesus, dude! [runs out after her. The two other girls give chase] "
11,14,The List,58421,Stan,"[breathlessly] Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something. "
11,14,The List,58427,Stan,"[he and Wendy reach the roof and run up to him] Kyle! Kyle, don't! "
11,14,The List,58429,Stan,"The list was a forgery, Kyle! "
11,14,The List,58431,Stan,"It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. [a gun is cocked and pops into view, aimed at Wendy] "
11,14,The List,58434,Stan,"It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up. "
11,14,The List,58443,Stan,Wendy! 
11,14,The List,58450,Stan,"Wendy! [she steps back and checks herself for bullet wounds, then finds the gun in her left hand. Bebe looks pained, then she checks herself for bullet wounds. Since they're both uninjured, they look around wondering where the bullet went.] "
11,14,The List,58456,Stan,"Here, Kyle. [hands the folder to Kyle. Wendy looks inside the bag - she's got herself some free shoes.] We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. [Kyle holds the folder in his hands, but...] "
11,14,The List,58458,Stan,"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle? "
11,14,The List,58460,Stan,...Abe Lincoln? 
11,14,The List,58462,Stan,"Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they? [smiles. As they smile, they look into each other's eyes. Stan begins to get queasy] Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! [throws up on her twice, and she just takes it as she used to do in third grade.] "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58505,Stan,[The boys sit down.] What's going on? Are we in trouble? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58507,Stan,[All five boys are surprised.] ...What? 
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58547,Stan,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58549,Stan,"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you? "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58557,Stan,"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58559,Stan,"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now... "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58561,Stan,"[backs away a bit] Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks. "
12,1,Tonsil Trouble,58598,Stan,[steps into view. Kyle is super angry] What did he do? 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58740,Stan,"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58766,Stan,[gets off the sofa] And she's at a hotel in our town. [Cartman gets up as well and gets restless] 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58770,Stan,"[thinks a bit, then] Butters, don't be such a pussy. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58775,Stan,Oh no. 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58783,Stan,"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58791,Stan,I told you that would work! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58797,Stan,"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58801,Stan,"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58804,Stan,You do? 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58811,Stan,We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her. 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58815,Stan,"Oh, thank God. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58819,Stan,"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58824,Stan,Oh no! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58828,Stan,"[his voice shaking] Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58844,Stan,"Yeah, of course. [begins to help out] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58850,Stan,Jesus Christ! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58852,Stan,"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58861,Stan,"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58867,Stan,What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58869,Stan,"No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58879,Stan,[annoyed] She doesn't have any lips! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58885,Stan,"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58887,Stan,[strokes his chin and takes a few steps forward] I know where. 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58889,Stan,We want three tickets to the North Pole. [the clerk stops what he's doing and looks around] 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58891,Stan,"We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. [Kyle and Britney stand behind him. Britney is wearing a wig, sunglasses, and hat as a disguise] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58907,Stan,"Oh no. [he and Kyle quickly whisk Britney away, the photographers hot on their tails. They pass a room whose door is slightly open. Seconds later they return to it, go in, and shut the door] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58908,Stan,"Dude, they're never gonna let us through. "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58913,Stan,"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. [Britney gargles something] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58929,Stan,"You doing okay, Ms. Spears? [she gargles. From the train's cab, the conductor looks back at Britney and Stan through the cab door's window] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58948,Stan,Oh no! 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58950,Stan,"[hops down and grabs Britney's hand] Come on, Britney! [pulls her out the opposite side and into the field] Come on, come on! [as they run, Kyle's hat falls away. They reach the end of the field and enter a clearing. They look around and find themselves surrounded. All sorts of people are there, not just paparazzi. The escape route they just used is closed off by more spectators. Stan looks around and some faces are recognizable, like Irene. Sheila and Gerald show up] "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58954,Stan,"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now? "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58956,Stan,Sacrificed? For what? 
12,2,Britney's New Look,58961,Stan,"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough! "
12,2,Britney's New Look,58966,Stan,"No wait. [Britney groans. People get close, take pictures, then make way for more people] "
12,3,Major Boobage,58990,Stan,"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you? "
12,3,Major Boobage,58995,Stan,"Yeah, this is not gonna work. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59001,Stan,Do you feel anything? 
12,3,Major Boobage,59018,Stan,What titties? 
12,3,Major Boobage,59021,Stan,"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59055,Stan,"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59058,Stan,"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59065,Stan,"Kenny, you home? [Kenny yells some more. Alarmed, the boys open the door and enter the house. They see that Kenny was indeed cheesing. Two cats look back at them.] "
12,3,Major Boobage,59076,Stan,"Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59080,Stan,"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59126,Stan,"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59129,Stan,He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic. 
12,3,Major Boobage,59132,Stan,"Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself. "
12,3,Major Boobage,59157,Stan,[puzzled] What the hell is he talking about? 
12,3,Major Boobage,59168,Stan,I'm sure glad that's over with. [the boys turn left and walk away] 
12,3,Major Boobage,59173,Stan,You guys! Check it out. [smiles] It's Kenny. [Kenny has crossed the street to reach a flower patch. He picks one out and inhales deeply] Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life. 
12,3,Major Boobage,59177,Stan,What the hell kind of flowers are those? 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59232,Stan,"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59236,Stan,"God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59244,Stan,"It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. [""Terrance and Phillip"" disappears and ""Family Guy"" comes on] "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59275,Stan,What'd they say? 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59287,Stan,This is going great! 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59316,Stan,"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59324,Stan,It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59370,Stan,We're the ones you told to get Internet money. 
12,4,Canada on Strike,59373,Stan,"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money! "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59400,Stan,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with. "
12,4,Canada on Strike,59403,Stan,...Yeah. 
12,5,"Eek, A Penis!",59426,Stan,"[to Kyle] Dude, wanna do some math problems? "
12,6,Over Logging,59654,Stan,"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things "
12,6,Over Logging,59656,Stan,"[sighs] Aw man! [shuts off his monitor as Sharon leaves, then goes to bed. Sharon heads for Shelly's room] "
12,6,Over Logging,59669,Stan,What the hell? 
12,6,Over Logging,59671,Stan,What? 
12,6,Over Logging,59673,Stan,My Internet's not working either. 
12,6,Over Logging,59688,Stan,[heads for a computer] I'm getting on it first. 
12,6,Over Logging,59690,Stan,"[steps into Kyle's room] Kyle, I need to use your Internet "
12,6,Over Logging,59699,Stan,What about Starbucks? They have free Internet. 
12,6,Over Logging,59737,Stan,"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control! "
12,6,Over Logging,59764,Stan,[annoyed] What's so funny about that? 
12,6,Over Logging,59769,Stan,"[walks up to her] Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. [she just sits up and punches him away like a beach ball, then lies down without a break in crying] "
12,6,Over Logging,59785,Stan,All right! 
12,6,Over Logging,59833,Stan,Eight fifty one. 
12,6,Over Logging,59835,Stan,Hey! Mom! 
12,6,Over Logging,59858,Stan,It's gotta be our turn soon. 
12,6,Over Logging,59879,Stan,Dad? 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59916,Stan,Ughh. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59923,Stan,"Naw, I'm with Wendy. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59941,Stan,"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59973,Stan,Sounds like police sirens. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59979,Stan,I don't know. [the gunmen gather up the students and adults] 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59982,Stan,Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone? 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59984,Stan,What?! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,59988,Stan,"Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops! "
12,7,Super Fun Time,59990,Stan,[in no mood to hear about it] This is not the time for that! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60009,Stan,"Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! [Kyle and Wendy trade places] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60062,Stan,"Wait, you have guns here? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60064,Stan,Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?! 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60161,Stan,"I can't let them do it. [comes out from under the table] I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. [turns and heads for the door, then exits the building] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60164,Stan,"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. [turns around, grabs some dirt, rubs it on his face, and walks to the hostage area] "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60167,Stan,"[walks up] Well howdy there, strangers. [everyone looks at him as he approaches] Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich.. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60170,Stan,I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60173,Stan,"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe. "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60176,Stan,"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60202,Stan,"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller? "
12,7,Super Fun Time,60204,Stan,He done killed yer pahr. 
12,7,Super Fun Time,60229,Stan,I know. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60250,Stan,"[stops Kyle in his tracks just by saying] Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something? "
12,8,The China Probrem,60254,Stan,"Kyle. [Kyle doesn't reply. Stan sighs, closes the door and approaches him] Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you've got to let this go. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60256,Stan,"Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60258,Stan,"There was nothing we could do, Kyle! [Kyle walks away. Stan says softly] There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60260,Stan,How? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60262,Stan,"You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60264,Stan,[puts his hands in his jacket pockets] God damn it. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60287,Stan,Let's get out of here! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60289,Stan,Come on! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60292,Stan,Oh God! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60297,Stan,"I can't watch! [uncovers his eyes and rises from his seat] Let's get out of here Kyle! [leaves. Kenny follows him out of the row, then Clyde, Butters, and Jimmy.] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60299,Stan,COME ON LET'S GO! [grabs Kyle by the right hand and drags him out] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60301,Stan,JUST RUN!! [the six boys run out of there.] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60303,Stan,Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie? [Kyle throws up] Come on dude! There's nothing we can do! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60307,Stan,"Let's just go, Let's just go! [grabs Kyle's right hand and pulls him away from the theater] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60339,Stan,"[walks into view] Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle. [walks towards the shore] You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60341,Stan,"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it. "
12,8,The China Probrem,60343,Stan,[turns to face Jimmy] I don't need this now. [looks away and closes his eyes] I just want things to be the way they were! [runs off] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60346,Stan,Indiana Jones! All right! [The screen is shown: Indy is at the foot of a long set of stairs] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60348,Stan,"[happily] You bet, Indiana! [Stan's jaw drops. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas walk up behind Indy, smiling] No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60351,Stan,No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! [they begin to disrobe Indy] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60354,Stan,Indy! [Lucas and Spielberg now have Indy pinned to the ground] 
12,8,The China Probrem,60359,Stan,"No, stop! Raape! "
12,8,The China Probrem,60399,Stan,"You aren't alone. [he enters the room with Kenny, Clyde, and Jimmy] "
12,8,The China Probrem,60401,Stan,We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again. [begins to cry and leans into Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him and begins to cry. The other boys cry as well] I love you. 
12,8,The China Probrem,60404,Stan,Wh-why? 
12,8,The China Probrem,60408,Stan,Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60442,Stan,But they raped Indiana Jones! 
12,8,The China Probrem,60492,Stan,"So, what now? "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60550,Stan,What? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60584,Stan,I guess so. 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60587,Stan,What am I supposed to do about it? [Craig and Jimmy walk up to him] 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60621,Stan,What? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60623,Stan,Yeah? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60625,Stan,"I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. [moves towards the stalls, but Cartman runs up ahead of him and stops him] "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60627,Stan,Really? 
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60629,Stan,"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60699,Stan,"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with. "
12,9,Breast Cancer Show Ever,60752,Stan,"Dude, we never thought you were cool. "
12,10,Pandemic,60771,Stan,"[pissed off] Oh Jesus, there's another one! [the other boys stop and look. A Peruvian pan flute band plays and draws a small crowd] Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? [the band has a bombo drummer, a siku player, and two charango players] "
12,10,Pandemic,60773,Stan,I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go! 
12,10,Pandemic,60775,Stan,[turns left and leaves] I gotta get home for dinner. 
12,10,Pandemic,60778,Stan,[pumping his fists] God! 
12,10,Pandemic,60780,Stan,"[""I'm outta here see ya guys. [leaves. Kyle and Cartman follow and Kenny dances again] ""]"
12,10,Pandemic,60783,Stan,They're in London too? 
12,10,Pandemic,60787,Stan,Where's dad? 
12,10,Pandemic,60789,Stan,Why? 
12,10,Pandemic,60796,Stan,Oh Jesus Christ! [Randy walks up behind him with the camera] 
12,10,Pandemic,60800,Stan,"You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night. "
12,10,Pandemic,60802,Stan,"So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs? "
12,10,Pandemic,60804,Stan,Over two hundred bucks. 
12,10,Pandemic,60807,Stan,"Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! [the other boys stay quiet] "
12,10,Pandemic,60809,Stan,"Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer. "
12,10,Pandemic,60811,Stan,Yeah! 
12,10,Pandemic,60819,Stan,"Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? [Craig stays quiet, so Cartman prevails upon him and enters his house] "
12,10,Pandemic,60826,Stan,"There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs. "
12,10,Pandemic,60832,Stan,"All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam! "
12,10,Pandemic,60840,Stan,"Ya see, Craig? [another band starts up nearby and Stan steps forward for a better look. The boys look to their right] "
12,10,Pandemic,60842,Stan,"Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. [the other band ignores them and continues playing] "
12,10,Pandemic,60844,Stan,"This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! [the other band looks at them for a few seconds, then resumes its music, its members grinning.] "
12,10,Pandemic,60847,Stan,"Come on, guys. [the boys return to their spot and start playing again, but another band begins to play off to their left] "
12,10,Pandemic,60848,Stan,Jesus Christ! 
12,10,Pandemic,60865,Stan,"Hey, back off! "
12,10,Pandemic,60876,Stan,"Eh-excuse us. Hello? [spots a soldier in one of the watchtowers] Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute? "
12,10,Pandemic,60879,Stan,"No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian- "
12,10,Pandemic,60896,Stan,Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us. 
12,10,Pandemic,60936,Stan,"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band. "
12,10,Pandemic,60938,Stan,"We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money. "
12,10,Pandemic,60944,Stan,We we speak English! 
12,10,Pandemic,60958,Stan,Help you how? 
12,10,Pandemic,60963,Stan,"Kyle, calm down. "
12,10,Pandemic,60965,Stan,One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. [the officials look at each other] 
12,10,Pandemic,60994,Stan,"Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now. "
12,10,Pandemic,60996,Stan,[firmly] Yes! 
12,10,Pandemic,60999,Stan,"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that? "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61045,Stan,"We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea! "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61055,Stan,Guinea pigs? 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61072,Stan,"[steps forward] Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61077,Stan,"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?! "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61119,Stan,"Dude, what is this place? "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61122,Stan,"[turns right and walks towards Craig] Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice! "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61154,Stan,Let's see what's in there. 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61156,Stan,"It might be a way out, Craig! "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61161,Stan,"You guys, look at this. [the others go to the wall Stan is looking at] It's a wall of ancient drawings. [first drawing is a group of four men playing instruments] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61163,Stan,"I know, a-and look. [second drawing is the flute band playing music, which is driving away two giant guinea pigs] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61166,Stan,And then the guinea pigs killing people. [they look a little lower] And then... [a boy holds a staff against a giant guinea pig] 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61170,Stan,"Dude, Craig, what's goin' on? "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61215,Stan,"Let's head over this way, guys. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61218,Stan,Wow. [they find themselves in a massive complex full of statues whose mouths or noses serve as waterfall fountains. Several suspension bridges connect the mouth of the statue they're in to the other statues] 
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61220,Stan,"All right, let's go. [Craig doesn't move] "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61222,Stan,"Wait, whattaya mean no? "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61224,Stan,"Dude, we we have to go check this out. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61226,Stan,"'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61228,Stan,"Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe! "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61232,Stan,"Craig, dude, wait up. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61235,Stan,"[Craig leads them across an open field] Hey look, there's something here. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61261,Stan,"No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands. "
12,11,Pandemic 2: The Startling,61271,Stan,Jesus Christ! 
12,12,About Last Night...,61329,Stan,"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother? "
12,12,About Last Night...,61356,Stan,"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. [outside the music changes to ""Who Let The Dogs Out?"" Someone swings from a traffic light and falls. A truck full of young adults rolls by] "
12,12,About Last Night...,61372,Stan,Jesus Christ... 
12,12,About Last Night...,61401,Stan,"[walks in from the dining room] Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61403,Stan,Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump! 
12,12,About Last Night...,61437,Stan,"[running up to him with Kyle] Dad Dad, we have a problem. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61439,Stan,"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61441,Stan,"Dude, he's wasted. "
12,12,About Last Night...,61447,Stan,"[quite concerned] Dad, what are you doing?! "
12,12,About Last Night...,61469,Stan,"[points ahead] Hey, there's some people. [ahead of them is a garage that has been converted into a cave. Stephen Stotch and the other McCain supporters are there putting stuff away. Stephen is holding a crowd of other McCain supporters at bay with a rifle.] "
12,12,About Last Night...,61478,Stan,"Let go of my face, asshole! "
12,12,About Last Night...,61516,Stan,Why does that matter? 
12,12,About Last Night...,61520,Stan,So where's the other doctor? [the nurse opens a door behind her and the other doctor... is hanging from a noose attached to the ceiling] 
12,12,About Last Night...,61561,Stan,"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61568,Stan,What's High School Musical 1 and 2? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61582,Stan,I have no idea. [the other boys turn in their seats to get a better view] 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61591,Stan,[while the boy is singing] Who the hell is that? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61600,Stan,"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out... "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61605,Stan,Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61608,Stan,"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61611,Stan,"All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. [holds up his right hand. Kyle holds his right hand up as well, and Kenny holds up his left] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61614,Stan,"Okay, good. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61619,Stan,But you didn't die? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61635,Stan,I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61637,Stan,"Stop. [holds his left hand out, palm out, for emphasis, and walks away. Jimmy stops singing] "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61639,Stan,"[walks up to Wendy] Uh, Wendy? "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61641,Stan,"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61643,Stan,"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61645,Stan,It is? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61647,Stan,[brightens up] Really? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61651,Stan,"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away. [at an intersection he takes a left turn] I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him. [kids appear behind him and follow him] But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse? [noticing the finger-snapping, he stops walking and looks around. The kids wait for him to start singing and dancing] No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61653,Stan,"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61662,Stan,"[now hiding behind a corner. Bridon passes by him unaware] Hey, kid, over here. [Bridon looks around and finds Stan, then walks over to him] Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61664,Stan,"Yeah, look, I-I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61666,Stan,"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me, [gets stern] you're driving everyone crazy. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61668,Stan,You don't like doing it? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61670,Stan,Basketball? 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61672,Stan,"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61674,Stan,"[firmly] Yes, you can. What's stopping you? "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61676,Stan,"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61678,Stan,"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61680,Stan,[proud of himself] Sweet. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61717,Stan,Aww! 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61724,Stan,"Hey kid, what happened?! I-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61726,Stan,"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself! [sees someone down the hall] Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett. [Mr. Garrett, the school coach, is eating an apple] This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61730,Stan,"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61733,Stan,"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61760,Stan,"[sighs deeply] Ah, shit. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61763,Stan,"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61768,Stan,"I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61773,Stan,"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little? "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61776,Stan,"That isn't true! [no one challenges] Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61803,Stan,"God damn it! [walks away. The next scene is him walking down the hall] No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop. [some kids look at him and decide to follow] And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? [he stops, the kids stop walking but continue snapping their fingers. Soon they smile in anticipation...]  Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah, [the kids' anticipation fades. Stan isn't singing as they'd hope he would] Someone's in the kitchen, I know. Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah Strummin' on the old banjo and go and Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o. Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o. [Wendy, Bebe, and some other kids arrive] Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o. Strumming on the old banjo jo jo... Go tell Aunt Rhodie Go tell Aunt Rhodie Go tell Aunt Rhodie The old gray goose is... Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to... [no one is making a sound. Stan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head, then turns left and walks away]   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61821,Stan,"Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61824,Stan,"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not! "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61826,Stan,Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical! 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61829,Stan,"Look, guys. [gets off the sofa and walks away from the other boys] The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school. [turns around to face them] And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now, [points to them] everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you. "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61841,Stan," [walks into view with the other three boys] That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. [music begins to play]  'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do. Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. [walks up to a boy and girl] True, girl, you know it's true, that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. [walks back to Bridon] He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61843,Stan," Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance. And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance. [the four boys form a chorus line and dance]   "
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61853,Stan, You gotta do what you wanna do!   
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61855,Stan, involves needing scissors and glue!   
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61857,Stan,Huh? [the other boys turn around] 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61860,Stan,But the girls like singing and dancing. 
12,13,Elementary School Musical,61862,Stan,"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61868,Stan,"No, I'm on the Japanese side. "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61873,Stan,"Dude, what? "
12,14,The Ungroundable,61875,Stan,What? 
12,14,The Ungroundable,61877,Stan,"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?! "
13,1,The Ring,62119,Stan,"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me. "
13,1,The Ring,62127,Stan,What? 
13,1,The Ring,62129,Stan,"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader. "
13,1,The Ring,62139,Stan,"[sighs] All right, come on, guys. [leaves the table with Kyle and Cartman.] "
13,1,The Ring,62143,Stan,"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! [Kyle and Cartman are with him] "
13,1,The Ring,62145,Stan,"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend. "
13,1,The Ring,62147,Stan,"[sighs and lowers his head] Oh, boy. "
13,1,The Ring,62172,Stan,A B.J.? 
13,1,The Ring,62176,Stan,"Yeah, dude, that's gross. "
13,1,The Ring,62257,Stan,"So how did it go last night? [Kenny breathes in deep and sighs, takes off his left glove and shows the other boys the purity ring Tammy gave him] "
13,1,The Ring,62264,Stan,"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a B.J. before you got too old an- "
13,1,The Ring,62272,Stan,They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore. 
13,1,The Ring,62318,Stan,"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together! "
13,1,The Ring,62322,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude. "
13,1,The Ring,62324,Stan,"[takes the DVD from Cartman and hands it back to Kenny] You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny? "
13,1,The Ring,62326,Stan,"[takes Kyle and Cartman aside] You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him. "
13,1,The Ring,62329,Stan,What? [he and Kyle walk up to get a better look - it's Teen Pop Magazine with Jonas Brothers on the cover] 
13,1,The Ring,62332,Stan,"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! [he and Cartman leave. Kyle stays in place a while, then walks back to Kenny, patting him on the back] "
13,1,The Ring,62353,Stan,Excuse us. Excuse us. 
13,1,The Ring,62357,Stan,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche! "
13,1,The Ring,62364,Stan,"Dude, who the hell did that? [a dart hits him in the neck] Hwa? [another one hits Kyle in the neck] "
13,1,The Ring,62370,Stan,We... don't work for anybody. 
13,1,The Ring,62387,Stan,We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night. 
13,2,The Coon,62461,Stan,Who's the Coon? 
13,2,The Coon,62541,Stan,Not really. 
13,2,The Coon,62543,Stan,"Dude, what the hell? "
13,2,The Coon,62545,Stan,"[opens his door to demonstrate something] Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62657,Stan,"Do I really have to do this, Dad? "
13,3,Margaritaville,62659,Stan,But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want. 
13,3,Margaritaville,62663,Stan,"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62665,Stan,"Uh, what? "
13,3,Margaritaville,62667,Stan,What's all gone? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62669,Stan,What do you mean? I have a hundred dollars. 
13,3,Margaritaville,62671,Stan,"Well, what can I do to get back my money-? "
13,3,Margaritaville,62673,Stan,I just opened an account. 
13,3,Margaritaville,62675,Stan,"No, you just lost it all! "
13,3,Margaritaville,62677,Stan,Hey! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62681,Stan,Dad! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62700,Stan,"Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money? "
13,3,Margaritaville,62702,Stan,"Yeah, I think I get it. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62713,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62715,Stan,What? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62717,Stan,So? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62719,Stan,Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62750,Stan,I wanna return this Margaritaville. 
13,3,Margaritaville,62753,Stan,"No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it. "
13,3,Margaritaville,62755,Stan,What? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62757,Stan,Wall Street? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62759,Stan,So? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62792,Stan,"'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please? "
13,3,Margaritaville,62794,Stan,My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here. 
13,3,Margaritaville,62796,Stan,It does? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62798,Stan,So I can return it to a bank? 
13,3,Margaritaville,62800,Stan,What?! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62802,Stan,Aargh! [walks off with the Margaritaville] 
13,3,Margaritaville,62817,Stan,I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62819,Stan,Nnnaaargh! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62821,Stan,[surprised] Really? [puts his hands together] Thank you. 
13,3,Margaritaville,62824,Stan,What?! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62835,Stan,Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?! 
13,3,Margaritaville,62837,Stan,"No, dude, that doesn't make sense! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62875,Stan,"What?! No way, Wendy, today's the day! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62891,Stan,Oh boy! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62939,Stan,We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62943,Stan,"You tell 'em, Cartman! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62963,Stan,"What? [a girl moves to the front of the group, and lets loose a queef into Butters' face. Butters is stunned and tries to get the queef off his face as if it were skunk musk] "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62973,Stan,"Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",62975,Stan,"It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-? "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63012,Stan,"Mom, gross! [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more] "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63016,Stan,"Stop it, Mom! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63023,Stan,I'm going too. [follows Randy] 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63026,Stan,"Yeah it's different, Mom! "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63062,Stan,"Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny. "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63080,Stan,On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing. 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63114,Stan,[coming down the stairs] No way! We did it?! [twirls around] Yeah!! 
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63121,Stan,"Mom, we didn't mean... [he and Randy are stunned. Randy walks to the sofa and sits down.] "
13,4,"Eat, Pray, Queef",63123,Stan,Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper. 
13,5,Fishsticks,63174,Stan,[walks up to the other guys] What's going on? 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63419,Stan,"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember? "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63421,Stan,What is that? 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63425,Stan,"[watching TV] Oh no, he didn't. "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63432,Stan,Tells? 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63434,Stan,"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an- "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63437,Stan,"It's uh, Marsh. [the official puts the car on a small stand, then measures and weighs it] "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63440,Stan,[in a resigned voice] Yes I do. 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63461,Stan,Yeah? 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63463,Stan,"Aw crap, Dad! [the men enter the house and walk past Stan. He closes the door behind them] "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63465,Stan,Alien? 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63467,Stan,What does it want? 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63470,Stan,Dad they aren't here for that. 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63506,Stan,"[whispering] Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit. "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63508,Stan,[whispering] Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit. 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63515,Stan,"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean. "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63546,Stan,"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated. "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63548,Stan,[alarmed] Kill the alien? 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63550,Stan,"No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen. "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63553,Stan,Dad? [McGee-zax comes in for a closer look] 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63558,Stan,I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right. 
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63568,Stan,"No, Dad- "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63572,Stan,"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing? "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63631,Stan,"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me! [the crowd makes way for him as he walks up to the ship] Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! [hands it to the judge] "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63634,Stan,"The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. [the crowd reacts to this admission.] "
13,6,Pinewood Derby,63637,Stan,"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. [everyone, including the world leaders from Kenya and South Korea, hangs on Stan's every word] "
13,7,Fatbeard,63662,Stan,"What are you talking about, dude? "
13,7,Fatbeard,63768,Stan,"[in the kitchen at his house] No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia. "
13,7,Fatbeard,63770,Stan,You really think he'll die in Somalia? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63943,Stan,"Dude, I don't even know who that is. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63984,Stan,Are you guys fucking serious? 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,63998,Stan,"It's gonna be alright, Kyle. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64002,Stan,"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64005,Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts? "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64026,Stan,Uh oh. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64037,Stan,"You're dead, Mr. Jackson! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64039,Stan,Accept it! [the various machines start convulsing and sparking] 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64051,Stan,"Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body! "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64069,Stan,"Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts... "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64071,Stan,"...setting traps for ghosts, no... "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64080,Stan,Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64084,Stan,So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl. 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64096,Stan,Yeahhhh! 
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64115,Stan,"[approaching the judges' table] Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64120,Stan,"Dude, the two male judges love her. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64128,Stan,"Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time. "
13,8,Dead Celebrities,64145,Stan,Woohoo! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64171,Stan,"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?! "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64252,Stan,"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses. "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64255,Stan,"Butters, you're the one doing all this? "
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64334,Stan,Butters. Dude! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64336,Stan,You can't call my girlfriend a bitch! 
13,9,Butters' Bottom Bitch,64339,Stan,"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64444,Stan,I'm having the best time! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64456,Stan,This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! [the other boys cheer this decision.] 
13,10,W.T.F.,64459,Stan,[a couple of seconds later] Why did they have us put on long underwear. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64466,Stan,Yeah! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64485,Stan,"Yeah, what are you? A child molester? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64491,Stan,"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64503,Stan,Yup. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64513,Stan,We'll see about that! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64523,Stan,You don't come to this country and make fun of it! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64525,Stan,I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64550,Stan,You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64554,Stan,What?! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64557,Stan,"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64563,Stan,"Irene, you said you loved me! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64580,Stan,"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64588,Stan,"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64607,Stan,From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64610,Stan,Vince McMahon is coming to see us? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64612,Stan,Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!.. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64618,Stan,Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday! 
13,10,W.T.F.,64625,Stan,"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. [Kyle turns to see the other three boys] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64630,Stan,"What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother. [Kenny climbs into the ring as El Pollo Loco] And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. [Kenny picks up the chair and swings it into Tolkien, and Stan turns to see him] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64638,Stan,Yeah? 
13,10,W.T.F.,64643,Stan,He's right. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64645,Stan,"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64647,Stan,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64655,Stan,"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Tolkien, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64666,Stan,"Yeah yeah, not bad. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64669,Stan,"Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64676,Stan,"He's here, Ohh my God [Kyle hops off the stool and joins Stan in the chant] Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o- "
13,10,W.T.F.,64680,Stan,"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64682,Stan,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer? "
13,10,W.T.F.,64684,Stan,"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. [Coach Connors sneaks up to the side of Cartman's house with a briefcase and puts his back up against the wall] "
13,10,W.T.F.,64692,Stan,"No, you can't possibly mean that-! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64701,Stan,"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you do something informal like that. "
13,10,W.T.F.,64713,Stan,"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64748,Stan,Dude. 
13,10,W.T.F.,64755,Stan,"What?? [three fights break out in the ring: Cartman vs. Kyle, Jimmy vs. Stan, and Tolkien vs. Butters] Fuck you, Jimmy! "
13,10,W.T.F.,64757,Stan,"Don't go pointing fingers at me, Cartman! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... [the fighting continues. The crowd gets bored of this unscripted fight] "
13,11,Whale Whores,64766,Stan,[happily] Wow cool. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64768,Stan,"Yeah, this is gonna be awesome. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64773,Stan,What the hell is that? [the trainer turns around. A group of Japanese men in kimonos run towards the pool with harpoons in hand.] 
13,11,Whale Whores,64786,Stan,"Dad, why did they do that? "
13,11,Whale Whores,64797,Stan,"[as Cartman finishes the chorus] Guys... guys... [Cartman turns off the mic] Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64799,Stan,"No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64801,Stan,"So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64803,Stan,"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64805,Stan,You're not? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64808,Stan,Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64810,Stan,"You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! [turns and walks out the front door. The boys don't move for a few seconds, then Cartman launches back into ""Poker Face"".] "
13,11,Whale Whores,64814,Stan,"[lights up] Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help? "
13,11,Whale Whores,64816,Stan,[turns to look at Butters] Really? [gets off his chair] People who are doing something? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64818,Stan,[determined] Then that's where I belong. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64830,Stan,Sweet! [the Sea Shepherd pulls up alongside the Herro Maru. The whalers gather at the railings and razz the Sea Shepherd] 
13,11,Whale Whores,64833,Stan,Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64843,Stan,"Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64845,Stan,"Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64848,Stan,"Wait, that's it? "
13,11,Whale Whores,64850,Stan,"Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64853,Stan,[can't believe how toothless their threats are] I thought you guys were pirates in a war! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64855,Stan,Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64867,Stan,"What you assholes acted like you were doing? [cries of ""ikaban"" come from the Herro Maru as it slowly sinks in the ocean and Japanese sailors jump off the ship] "
13,11,Whale Whores,64869,Stan,"Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! [the crew pulls at the ropes, and the covers comes off the statue - it's Godzilla.] "
13,11,Whale Whores,64878,Stan,"No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64880,Stan,"...No, I don't care about the show. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64882,Stan,I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64888,Stan,Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64891,Stan,"Screw this, I gotta get back to work! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64894,Stan,Would you mind stepping back a little? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64896,Stan,"No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64899,Stan,"Oh no, no, NO. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64901,Stan,Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64904,Stan,I asked you guys to help me and you said no! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64906,Stan,"You said ""Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"" "
13,11,Whale Whores,64908,Stan,"Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64912,Stan,Take us out of port! All hands to stations! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64915,Stan,"As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! [the Sea Shepherd lurches all of a sudden.] "
13,11,Whale Whores,64918,Stan,"Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64920,Stan,What? [goes outside with the crew] 
13,11,Whale Whores,64923,Stan,"What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64927,Stan,Screw this! Turn hard to port! [takes the wheel and starts turning left] 
13,11,Whale Whores,64929,Stan,"Dude, fuck you! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64940,Stan,What was that? [moments later the crew goes on deck. Stan is with them] 
13,11,Whale Whores,64944,Stan,It's like... they know. [two whales latch onto buoys at either end of a net and begin to haul away the crab fishing boat.] 
13,11,Whale Whores,64946,Stan,They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64949,Stan,"Jesus Christ! [Everyone looks around as more planes come in and take out the whales surrounding the boat. Two whales take a dive to deeper water, but two planes follow them under and blow up. The whales' corpses float up onto the water's surface.] We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64951,Stan,"[catching his breath] I, I can't, I can't believe it. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64955,Stan,Will you stop that? 
13,11,Whale Whores,64957,Stan,"Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet! "
13,11,Whale Whores,64961,Stan,You speak English. 
13,11,Whale Whores,64966,Stan,Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?! 
13,11,Whale Whores,64975,Stan,"Ummm, where did you get that picture? "
13,11,Whale Whores,64978,Stan,"Dude, it wasn't actually and dolphin and a whale who bombed Hiroshima. It was the- "
13,11,Whale Whores,64980,Stan,"Oh, right. Look, I... I think I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone? "
13,11,Whale Whores,64983,Stan,"Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me. "
13,11,Whale Whores,64985,Stan,"Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth. [pulls out a manila envelope and walks to the Prime Minister's desk] Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers. [hands the envelope to the Prime Minister, who opens it and pulls out the ""unaltered"" photo. The Prime Minister and the officials crowd in to look at the photo.] A chicken and a cow. "
13,12,The F Word,64995,Stan,"Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day. "
13,12,The F Word,64998,Stan,Aww! Not those guys again! [the boys leave the pond and head over to the source of the noise - a group of bikers idling at at intersection for no other reason than to revel in the sound of their own bikes' motors] 
13,12,The F Word,65000,Stan,God! Shut up! 
13,12,The F Word,65051,Stan,God damn it God damn it! 
13,12,The F Word,65055,Stan,"All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it. "
13,12,The F Word,65059,Stan,"Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can- [the bikers roll by on Stan's street, then Stan sighs when they're gone] ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all. "
13,12,The F Word,65066,Stan,"...That makes perfect sense, Butters. "
13,12,The F Word,65068,Stan,"Yes, now get out of here. "
13,12,The F Word,65070,Stan,"Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea? "
13,12,The F Word,65072,Stan,[taking notes] Oh that's good. 
13,12,The F Word,65074,Stan,But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off? 
13,12,The F Word,65076,Stan,"Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it! "
13,12,The F Word,65091,Stan,"Really nice work, guys. "
13,12,The F Word,65101,Stan,"Yeah, we did that! "
13,12,The F Word,65108,Stan,Gay people? 
13,12,The F Word,65111,Stan,"Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town? "
13,12,The F Word,65115,Stan,Aw crap! 
13,12,The F Word,65129,Stan,"Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay. "
13,12,The F Word,65131,Stan,"Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time? "
13,12,The F Word,65133,Stan,Then you're not a fag. 
13,12,The F Word,65136,Stan,I don't know. 
13,12,The F Word,65138,Stan,"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind? "
13,12,The F Word,65140,Stan,"Right. But you're not thinkin' ""Oh, he's a homosexual,"" you're thinkin' ""Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."" "
13,12,The F Word,65145,Stan,"""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?! "
13,12,The F Word,65173,Stan,"Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days. "
13,12,The F Word,65176,Stan,Aw crap! [drops the basketball] 
13,12,The F Word,65183,Stan,We can fix this! 
13,12,The F Word,65185,Stan,"That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition. "
13,12,The F Word,65194,Stan,"Ohh, it all makes sense now. [the four men walk onto the right side of the stage. The crowd cheers and claps] "
13,12,The F Word,65198,Stan,There's fags everywhere! 
13,12,The F Word,65202,Stan,"[backing up as far as he can] Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. [the other boys do as well] "
13,12,The F Word,65205,Stan,"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does. "
13,12,The F Word,65207,Stan,But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand. 
13,12,The F Word,65220,Stan,"...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags. "
13,12,The F Word,65222,Stan,We did it! Yeah! 
13,12,The F Word,65225,Stan,"Today, we've made history. "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65332,Stan,What the hell do you think you're doing?! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65334,Stan,I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65336,Stan,"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"". "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65338,Stan,"""Or does she?"" "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65343,Stan,"Hey hey, stop reading that! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65345,Stan,"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about! "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65348,Stan,"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now? "
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65350,Stan,Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president. 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65434,Stan,What?! 
13,13,Dances with Smurfs,65452,Stan,"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore? "
13,14,Pee,65460,Stan,"[annoyed] Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. [his father Randy is driving. The other boys present are Butters, Kenny, and Jimmy] "
13,14,Pee,65466,Stan,We're here! It's the water park! [Randy pulls up at the front entrance and drops the boys off.] 
13,14,Pee,65470,Stan,"We got it, Dad. "
13,14,Pee,65476,Stan,"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman? "
13,14,Pee,65479,Stan,"Dude, this is awesome. "
13,14,Pee,65485,Stan,Okay. 
13,14,Pee,65488,Stan,"Come on Kyle, let's check out the fireboats. "
13,14,Pee,65490,Stan,"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it. "
13,14,Pee,65493,Stan,"Yeah, they do, Kyle. "
13,14,Pee,65496,Stan,"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath. "
13,14,Pee,65506,Stan,"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides? "
13,14,Pee,65509,Stan,"Aw come on, Kyle. "
13,14,Pee,65511,Stan,Not everybody pees in pools. 
13,14,Pee,65513,Stan,Not today... yet. 
13,14,Pee,65515,Stan,"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day? "
13,14,Pee,65518,Stan,"Dude, where have you been? "
13,14,Pee,65528,Stan,This is more math than I've ever seen you do. 
13,14,Pee,65532,Stan,I'm gonna go on the slides. 
13,14,Pee,65556,Stan,"This is sweet, huh Kenny? [Kenny, who's facing away from the camera, doesn't say anything. A girl in an inner tube floats past the boys, then stops and lets loose some pee. Sure enough, the ground begins to rumble and shake.] "
13,14,Pee,65564,Stan,"[in a shaky voice] Aaaah! [stops and looks at the pee, and sees a familiar boy floating in the water, face down] OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY! "
13,14,Pee,65590,Stan,"[on a small plateau on the attraction] Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us! "
13,14,Pee,65595,Stan,Well if you don't swim in it you're gonna die! 
13,14,Pee,65597,Stan,"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal! "
13,14,Pee,65599,Stan,"[hesitantly] ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom. "
13,14,Pee,65601,Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim. "
13,14,Pee,65603,Stan,Not... all the time. 
13,14,Pee,65605,Stan,Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee! 
13,14,Pee,65607,Stan,"Kyle, come on! "
13,14,Pee,65640,Stan,I don't know. [they hear the sobs of a crying man nearby] 
13,14,Pee,65642,Stan,Who are you? 
13,14,Pee,65653,Stan,"...Well, it's not like if you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower. "
13,14,Pee,65686,Stan,"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss? "
13,14,Pee,65689,Stan,"Just drink the pee, Kyle. "
13,14,Pee,65713,Stan,"Come on, dude! "
13,14,Pee,65724,Stan,"All right, they finally came for us. [he, Butters and Jimmy have wide smiles] "
13,14,Pee,65734,Stan,"Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65760,Stan,What are you guys doing? 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65848,Stan,"Aw dude, I clocked you! "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65850,Stan,"Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. [Elin gets a new club and her swings get faster] "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65852,Stan,Hit A and X together. 
14,1,Sexual Healing,65855,Stan,"I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65919,Stan,"Yeah, back in that water level. [looks over at the front door, then back at the game] Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense. "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65978,Stan,"Yeah, where's all the fighting? "
14,1,Sexual Healing,65980,Stan,"Yeah, golf is stupid again. [gets off the sofa and tosses his controller onto the sofa, then follows Cartman out] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,65987,Stan,All right! 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66000,Stan,Did you get to any dirty parts yet? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66002,Stan,"[turns the page] I don't get it dude. W-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times. "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66009,Stan,Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous? 
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66016,Stan,"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. [Kyle breaks into a grin] "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66050,Stan,"[runs into the living room in a panic] Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer! My parents must have found it! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66052,Stan,"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me! "
14,2,The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs,66055,Stan,"Well dude, somebody has got to go down! "

14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66781,Stan,"Awgh! [catches his breath. With his profile destroyed, Stan sees that he has 0 friends.] Oh thank God. "
14,4,You Have 0 Friends,66783,Stan,"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else. "

14,5,200,66855,Stan,Ooooooo... 
14,5,200,66867,Stan,I saw him once. [everyone turns towards Stan] 
14,5,200,66869,Stan,"Yeah, a while ago, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends. "
14,5,200,66871,Stan,"No, dude, it was totally fine. "
14,5,200,66873,Stan,"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln... "
14,5,200,66899,Stan,"Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour. "
14,5,200,66902,Stan,"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ! "
14,5,200,66908,Stan,Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything. 
14,5,200,66915,Stan,"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there! "
14,5,200,66954,Stan,"What? No, Dad, we promised that Muhammad would stay in the truck. "
14,5,200,66958,Stan,"No, you can't even show his feet. "
14,5,200,66993,Stan,"Muhammad, are you okay? [Runs toward Muhammad and helps him up] "
14,5,200,66996,Stan,They want his power? 
14,5,200,67026,Stan,"Yeah, we said we'd take care of him. "
14,5,200,67028,Stan,We made a promise... to Jesus! [Randy steps forward] 
14,5,200,67082,Stan,"Dude, we can't do that "
14,6,201,67106,Stan,"It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here! "
14,6,201,67113,Stan,"Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad. "
14,6,201,67118,Stan,When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul! 
14,6,201,67120,Stan,"If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?! "
14,6,201,67169,Stan,"Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad! "
14,6,201,67171,Stan,Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.

14,6,201,67197,Stan,"Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now! "
14,6,201,67215,Stan,"Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad. "
14,6,201,67223,Stan,"Come on, guys, we're running out of time! [more knocking is heard at Mephesto's door, and Mephesto turns around] "
14,6,201,67230,Stan,That's not cool! 
14,6,201,67233,Stan,"We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president! "
14,6,201,67236,Stan,"Oh crap, the gingers! "
14,6,201,67252,Stan,What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?! 
14,6,201,67320,Stan,"Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. [everyone stops and gasps. The ""CENSORED"" bar disappears and Tom is shown again] "

14,6,201,67334,Stan,"Oh, dude, look. [Cartman is shown on a gurney, crying. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him] Hey, Cartman... "
14,6,201,67337,Stan,"Yeah, dude, we, we know what it means. "
14,6,201,67353,Stan,"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that you had Seaman on your back. "
14,6,201,67356,Stan,"We do? Oh, oh, yeah, we do! "
14,6,201,67358,Stan,We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there. 
14,7,Crippled Summer,67373,Stan,"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left! "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67376,Stan,"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! [Towelie is shown lighting a joint as the camera pulls away] "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67391,Stan,[in studio] We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us! [crosses his arms] Stupid towel! 
14,7,Crippled Summer,67422,Stan,"[in studio] A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody. "
14,7,Crippled Summer,67536,Stan,[in studio] Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react. 
14,7,Crippled Summer,67586,Stan,"[reads his note] Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go? "
14,8,Poor and Stupid,67639,Stan,"Cartman, dude, what's wrong? "

14,8,Poor and Stupid,67665,Stan,"Dude, you are so retarded! "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67943,Stan,You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other! 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,67947,Stan,"They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, ""Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."" "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68012,Stan,Did you know your mom was from Jersey? 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68014,Stan,"No, uh, it just explains a lot. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68018,Stan,"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is. "

14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68151,Stan,"Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do? "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68153,Stan,"[flatly] Why? [Kyle continues writhing and groaning, before throwing his hat away] "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68155,Stan,..Dude. 
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68168,Stan,"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal. "
14,9,It's a Jersey Thing,68171,Stan,"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage? "
14,10,Insheeption,68179,Stan,A note? 
14,10,Insheeption,68182,Stan,[omitting the names] We need to talk. 
14,10,Insheeption,68187,Stan,"[approaching] Is something wrong, Wendy? [Wendy sees him, then looks at the girls, gets up and walks up to Stan] "
14,10,Insheeption,68189,Stan,My locker? 
14,10,Insheeption,68191,Stan,Are you serious? 
14,10,Insheeption,68193,Stan,"Well, it's just a little messy. "
14,10,Insheeption,68195,Stan,"Aw, come on. "
14,10,Insheeption,68197,Stan,"Yeah, alright. "
14,10,Insheeption,68201,Stan,"What, come on, it's not that bad. "
14,10,Insheeption,68203,Stan,"My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away. "
14,10,Insheeption,68205,Stan,"Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box. "
14,10,Insheeption,68207,Stan,"Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I- "
14,10,Insheeption,68209,Stan,"Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I- "
14,10,Insheeption,68212,Stan,"Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that. "
14,10,Insheeption,68214,Stan,"Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like- "
14,10,Insheeption,68216,Stan,"Well, I- I guess so, but- [Dr. Chinstrap dumps the baggie into the large trash bag his assistant is holding. The assistant is wearing a facemask] Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny look at each other worriedly] "
14,10,Insheeption,68218,Stan,"Well no, don't throw that out. "
14,10,Insheeption,68220,Stan,"[begins gathering up the papers] No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-! [takes the bottle from Dr. Chinstrap. The assistant pulls out the baggie] G-give me back my sandwich! [Stan grabs the baggie, then reaches for another loose sheet, when he realizes what he's done. Cartman makes a circle around his right ear with his index finger and whistles a cuckoo tune] "
14,10,Insheeption,68222,Stan,I don't... I don't know. 
14,10,Insheeption,68226,Stan,"Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... ""hoarding."" "
14,10,Insheeption,68228,Stan,"Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk? "
14,10,Insheeption,68230,Stan,"[looks around again] Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about? "
14,10,Insheeption,68232,Stan,"[looks around and picks up an empty milk carton from a box] Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like- "
14,10,Insheeption,68273,Stan,"What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here? "
14,10,Insheeption,68277,Stan,What the hell's going on?! 
14,10,Insheeption,68291,Stan,Mr. Mackey. 
14,10,Insheeption,68293,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, what are you doing? "
14,10,Insheeption,68295,Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up! "
14,10,Insheeption,68297,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me. "
14,10,Insheeption,68300,Stan,I'm working on it! 
14,10,Insheeption,68302,Stan,"[walks up to Mackey and turns him around] Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! [something hits Mackey's window and he goes to see what it was. He sees Billy on the sidewalk with his friends] "
14,10,Insheeption,68307,Stan,Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip? 
14,10,Insheeption,68310,Stan,Oh-Ohhhhhhh. 
14,10,Insheeption,68326,Stan,"Wait wait, where the hell are we now? "
14,10,Insheeption,68330,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy! "
14,10,Insheeption,68335,Stan,"Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey. "
14,10,Insheeption,68337,Stan,Dad? Is that you? 
14,10,Insheeption,68339,Stan,Where are you? 
14,10,Insheeption,68341,Stan,"The hell are you doing, dad? "
14,10,Insheeption,68343,Stan,Did you come here to help me? 
14,10,Insheeption,68345,Stan,"Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality! "
14,10,Insheeption,68347,Stan,DAD! 
14,10,Insheeption,68350,Stan,[moaning in frustration] Aaaaaagh! 
14,10,Insheeption,68404,Stan,Who's that? 
14,10,Insheeption,68416,Stan,What the fuck? 
14,10,Insheeption,68437,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, stop running! "
14,10,Insheeption,68439,Stan,"Look, dude! [catches up to Mackey and stops him] Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time. "
14,10,Insheeption,68443,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding. "
14,10,Insheeption,68445,Stan,Shut up! 
14,10,Insheeption,68476,Stan,You can do it Mr. Mackey. 
14,10,Insheeption,68480,Stan,What the hell? 
14,10,Insheeption,68483,Stan,Who are you people? 
14,10,Insheeption,68485,Stan,"Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own? "
14,10,Insheeption,68488,Stan,...So then why aren't we waking up? 
14,10,Insheeption,68500,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now! "
14,10,Insheeption,68519,Stan,[thinks a moment] I think I have a better idea. 
14,10,Insheeption,68522,Stan,"Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with. "
14,10,Insheeption,68524,Stan,"Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy! "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68583,Stan,Who's Captain Hindsight? 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68602,Stan,Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said. 
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68607,Stan,"[backs up towards the stairs] Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room? "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68801,Stan,"Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys. "
14,11,Coon 2: Hindsight,68806,Stan,"It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! [the seven suit up and leave the house. Mysterion goes to the camera and covers it with his cape] "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69255,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing? "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69257,Stan,Aw crap. [they go to the breakfast table while Randy serves up their dishes] 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69263,Stan,Can I have a Pop Tart? 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69273,Stan,"Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels. "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69347,Stan,"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69350,Stan,Awww what?! 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69352,Stan,"No, dad! No! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69354,Stan,"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69358,Stan,"Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69361,Stan,Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef. 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69363,Stan,"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69368,Stan,"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69383,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing? "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69390,Stan,Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef! 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69392,Stan,"No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back! "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69409,Stan,He's not going to listen to us! We already tried! 
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69412,Stan,"That's stupid, Cartman. "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69417,Stan,"You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded. "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69419,Stan,"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you. "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69438,Stan,"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up. "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69440,Stan,"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! [another camera crew comes in, with another chef] "
14,14,Crème Fraiche,69446,Stan,"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69499,Stan,"Let me see your iPad, Cartman. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69527,Stan,What? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69529,Stan,Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69533,Stan,[earnestly] I do. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69613,Stan,We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69616,Stan,Oh boy. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69619,Stan,For what? 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69621,Stan,"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! You guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69678,Stan,"Okay, the Geniuses will see us now. [the group leaves their seats and head to the Genius bar, but Stan stops them midway] Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. [Stan leads the group forward] "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69681,Stan,"Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69685,Stan,69ingchipmunks@me.com [Gerald is surprised] 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69693,Stan,"Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69726,Stan,"[looks at the boy] No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend. "
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69733,Stan,I think Verizon. 
15,1,HUMANCENTiPAD,69756,Stan,"Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future? "
15,2,Funnybot,69784,Stan,"Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy. "
15,2,Funnybot,69787,Stan,"Oh man, really? "
15,2,Funnybot,69799,Stan,Can we go now? 
15,2,Funnybot,69831,Stan,We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us! 
15,2,Funnybot,69856,Stan,What the hell are they gonna do to us? 
15,2,Funnybot,69890,Stan,"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work. "
15,2,Funnybot,69892,Stan,"[smiles, but notices Jimmy's silence] What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed. "
15,2,Funnybot,69897,Stan,"All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. [the cafeteria doors fly open and a bunch of armed actors rush in, led by Adam Sandler and Jay Leno] "
15,2,Funnybot,69901,Stan,"Naw dude, don't make us go back in the- "
15,2,Funnybot,69919,Stan,"'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot. "
15,2,Funnybot,69941,Stan,What the hell are you doing?! 
15,2,Funnybot,69945,Stan,"Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth? "
15,2,Funnybot,69963,Stan,We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas? 
15,2,Funnybot,69966,Stan,A what? 
15,2,Funnybot,69977,Stan,That's it! Hurry! Gooo! [he and Kyle move towards Funnybot with huge antigravs and clamp them onto Funnybot] 
15,2,Funnybot,69979,Stan,Okay we got it! We got it! [the box must contain what the comedians wanted from the boys - Funnybot] 
15,2,Funnybot,69983,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with. "
15,3,Royal Pudding,70156,Stan,My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70166,Stan,"No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70173,Stan,"Dude we're, we're just trying to eat. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70175,Stan,Yeah. 
15,4,T.M.I.,70179,Stan,"Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners? "
15,4,T.M.I.,70192,Stan,"Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right. "
15,4,T.M.I.,70217,Stan,['You made everyone else get measured with witnesses you have to too. ']
15,4,T.M.I.,70219,Stan,You just did that to everybody in class! 
15,4,T.M.I.,70222,Stan,Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side. [continues directing until the poster is on just right] Yeup. [Cartman stands defiant until the poster is up. The girls begin to enter the hallway] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70411,Stan,I know! This is awesome! 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70416,Stan,What? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70419,Stan,"Aw dude, that's so sad. [puts up his right hand and looks away] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70422,Stan,"Awww dude, awwww. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70490,Stan,"Go long, Tolkien! Go go! [Tolkien runs across the yard. Stan throws the ball and Tolkien catches it] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70492,Stan,"Wow, really? [takes the money and starts counting it] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70494,Stan,Doing what? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70496,Stan,[somewhat startled] ...Dude. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70520,Stan,...You sound like Cartmam. 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70522,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too. "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70567,Stan,[blinks sleepily] McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70618,Stan,You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. [leaves the table] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70620,Stan,[stands next to Craig and Clyde] My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. [blinks his eyes and walks away. The others are dumbstruck for several seconds] 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70636,Stan,It's what? 
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70640,Stan,"[tugs at Kyle's coat] Kyle, Kyle! Look. [in a corner sits one of Slash's hats and one of his guitars] "
15,5,Crack Baby Athletic Association,70642,Stan,Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70891,Stan,"[opening his gift] Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70895,Stan,"Oh thanks, dude. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70899,Stan,"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70904,Stan,"Mom, I'm 10 years old now. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70946,Stan,We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70951,Stan,That sounds like shit! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70957,Stan,"I know, Mom. I love you too. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70959,Stan,"It's okay, Mom. I understand. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70961,Stan,"'Night. [Sharon turns off the lights and closes the door. A few seconds later, Stan opens his eyes and looks at the door to make sure his mom isn't looking at him. Then he reaches under the mattress and pulls out his iPod] Haha. [listens to some music. Soon some shitty sounds creep in] Ugh. [tries some other tracks, but each one has poop noises in it. He sits up] What the hell? [tries more tracks, but all he hears now is shit] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70966,Stan,Hey dudes. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70968,Stan,"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70970,Stan,"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70972,Stan,"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70974,Stan,It... kind of sounds like shit. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70976,Stan,"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close. [has Kyle listen to a track] You don't hear shit? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70978,Stan,That doesn't sound like shit to you? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70981,Stan,"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70983,Stan,"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70985,Stan,I just turned 10. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70987,Stan,So this is normal? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70989,Stan,Sounds like shit. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70991,Stan,Uh that sounds like shit too. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70993,Stan,"Yeah dude, it's just shit. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70995,Stan,"They both look the same. [true enough, except for the turds] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,70997,Stan,No. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,70999,Stan,They both look like turds about to be reheated to me. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71001,Stan,Oh no. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71030,Stan,Hey guys. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71032,Stan,He said I have cynicism? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71034,Stan,"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71036,Stan,"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button? "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71039,Stan,How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71042,Stan,That's such a shitty device to keep people playing. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71045,Stan,"[looking at his chocolate sundae] Aw, dude, this looks like shit. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71047,Stan,"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71050,Stan,"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71052,Stan,"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71069,Stan,Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71071,Stan,Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71073,Stan,"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. [just outside, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny walk by, not noticing Stan in the diner. Stan, on the other hand, notices them walk by. He quickly leaves the booth and catches up with them outside, where they're happily talking about something.] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71075,Stan,I thought you guys were sick! [the other boys don't know what to say] 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71077,Stan,"Dude, you totally lied to me! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71079,Stan,Where were you guys going?! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71081,Stan,Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71083,Stan,You guys... don't wanna be around me? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71085,Stan,"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71087,Stan,I won't say a word. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71089,Stan,Oh shit. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71091,Stan,"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! [apparently trailers are still playing] "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71095,Stan,Awww God! [squeezes his eyes shut and puts his hand over them] 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71097,Stan,"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71101,Stan,How can you say that looks good?! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71105,Stan,[shields his eyes from the shit] Ugh. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71107,Stan,But it's just crap. 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71112,Stan,"Oh come on, people! "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71114,Stan,"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry. "
15,7,You're Getting Old,71116,Stan,Me?! Did you see that shit?! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71118,Stan,Hang on guys! 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71120,Stan,Kyle? 
15,7,You're Getting Old,71122,Stan,"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71184,Stan,"[in an angry outburst] God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! [looks around glaring at everyone, who look back at him, stunned] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71187,Stan,[after a few seconds' silence] I just want everything to go back to the way it was. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71189,Stan,"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? [tears start to well up around his eyes] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71247,Stan,"Wait, it's not a real illness? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71249,Stan,"[gets off the sofa and walks towards the door] Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71251,Stan,[turns around] Yeah. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71269,Stan,Who are you people? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71271,Stan,Huh? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71273,Stan,Aliens? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71277,Stan,Because of aliens? [crosses his arms] 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71279,Stan,Yeah I'm ready! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71281,Stan,"Ahhhh! [walks around town looking at it with a new sense of wonder, but his walking is off] Oh coool! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71285,Stan,"[laughs rather heartily, looking drunk] Adam Sandler's funny. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71289,Stan,[sees him] Kyle! [falls into Kyle's arms] 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71291,Stan,"[his speech is slurred] Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71293,Stan,"Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71295,Stan,"[squints his eyes] But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! [turns around excitedly] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71297,Stan,"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71299,Stan,"...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? [Cartman walks over, drying his hands off in the process] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71305,Stan,"Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71307,Stan,"[a couple of seconds of silence, then Stan gives him the finger.] Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit! [Kyle sighs and walks back to the burger stand] ...Kyle, I love you. [Kyle reappears a few seconds later, and Stan gives him the finger again.] You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you! [Kyle turns heel and walks back towards the stand] ...I love you. [Kyle does not return] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71315,Stan,I feel like total shit. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71318,Stan,The rock creatures? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71320,Stan,"Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any... "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71324,Stan,Ugh God. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71336,Stan,"[falls onto the floor] Aughah. [gets up and starts firing indiscriminately, moaning all the while. He falls on his back, fires off a few more shots, turns his head to his left side, and throws up. He passes out] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71339,Stan,"[sniffs and then smacks his lips a bit, finally waking up] ...Enchirito? "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71341,Stan,What? You guys are aliens? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71343,Stan,"Dude, I don't know! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71346,Stan,I'm not friends with him. 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71348,Stan,"No, no, we don't hang out anymore. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71350,Stan,"Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71352,Stan,I don't know! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71358,Stan,"Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71360,Stan,How do you guys make them so yummy? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71363,Stan,"[panicking, but with great restraint] Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71365,Stan,"No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71368,Stan,"Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71370,Stan,"Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71377,Stan,Just stop it! You people are so full of shit! 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71379,Stan,"No, I'm done with that! [slaps it away from the member's hand] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71381,Stan,"I don't want everything to go back to the way it was! [suddenly calm] I, I don't. [he steps over the broken bottle, leaves and joins the other kids, who have returned] You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town. [approaches one boy] Maybe this kid will become my new best friend. [then another] Or maybe this kid will. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71383,Stan,"Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. [a horn and the sound of wheels stopping are heard] "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71385,Stan,[his face drops] What? 
15,8,Ass Burgers,71387,Stan,"No, dad, no. No, please! "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71390,Stan,"No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn. "
15,8,Ass Burgers,71403,Stan,"...K, coming. [hops out of bed and puts on his coat, going through the motions. He walks out to join the boys, but a few seconds later he returns to open a drawer, pull out a bottle of whiskey, opens it, takes a swig of it, closes it, and puts it back in the drawer. He doesn't bother to put on his shoes. He closes the drawer and heads back into the hall] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71411,Stan,"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71413,Stan,"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71423,Stan,Base! [the others turn to see Stan in their midst] 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71434,Stan,"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet."" [most of the other boys laugh] "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71438,Stan,"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71463,Stan,What are you talking about? 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71466,Stan,"Yeah, I think he was? Wait. "
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71470,Stan,Butters! 
15,9,The Last of the Meheecans,71622,Stan,"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71628,Stan,What? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71632,Stan,What about him? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71643,Stan,Turn it up. [Cartman obliges] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71673,Stan,No way. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71675,Stan,The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71677,Stan,"Come on dude, it's pretty funny. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71679,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's pretty funny. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71725,Stan,"Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simons' boyfriend calling her ""soft-serve Simon."" "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71729,Stan,"Come on, dude, it's pretty funny! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71731,Stan,I wouldn't care. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71733,Stan,What? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71735,Stan,"[sees Kenny and walks up to him at his locker] Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71737,Stan,How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71739,Stan,Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71741,Stan,That was a private e-mail from me to you! [notices a pissed-off Wendy approaching] Hey Wendy. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71744,Stan,"No, I was telling Kenny he would like it. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71746,Stan,"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71749,Stan,"This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all! [The others present are Red, Kenny, Butters, Craig (looking at his iPhone), Wendy, Kyle, Bebe, and Tolkien. Kyle raises his hand] Yes, Kyle. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71751,Stan,"Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71753,Stan,"Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room! [the other eight look at each other] Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch! [pounds the podium with his fists] And we're not gonna-! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71755,Stan,What? How do you know? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71760,Stan,We only have music class on Thursday. 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71763,Stan,Oh I'm ready! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71767,Stan,Don't let him get away! 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71769,Stan,What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71782,Stan,Stop that rat! [Wikileaks jumps off the lockers and runs for the computer lab] 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71784,Stan,"Knock it off! [Wikileaks hops off and heads for the nearest air vent, and makes his escape] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71811,Stan,"You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon. "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71818,Stan,Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71822,Stan,Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71845,Stan,Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71847,Stan,"Come on, guys! [charges in with the other kids. Mrs. Trumski is about to close the door when Catatafish floats in] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71851,Stan,"Quick, we need something to carry him in! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71854,Stan,"We just need to borrow him, kid. [Kyle hands the box to Butters] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71856,Stan,"[walks up to Vernon] Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71863,Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, wait! [the bus stops, the door opens, and the group gets on] "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71866,Stan,Can't this thing go any faster? 
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71869,Stan,"Craig, are we still clear? "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71876,Stan,"Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71885,Stan,"Stop right there, you little rat! "
15,10,Bass to Mouth,71894,Stan,Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. 
15,11,Broadway Bro Down,71957,Stan,"Come on, Larry! [Larry continues crying] Dude, why does this happen every time? "
15,11,Broadway Bro Down,71969,Stan,"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! [Shelly walks up the little ladder to the board and jumps up and down] "
15,11,Broadway Bro Down,71981,Stan,"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us? "
15,11,Broadway Bro Down,71984,Stan,No. Dad. Please don't do this! 
15,11,Broadway Bro Down,71993,Stan,"[just outside the dining room on the phone with Randy while Mr. Feegan speaks.] Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out. [no answer] Please answer the phone Dad. [no answer. He looks around] Dad? "
15,12,1%,72229,Stan,God this sucks! 
15,12,1%,72236,Stan,"Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you! "
15,12,1%,72238,Stan,Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy! 
15,12,1%,72245,Stan,"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby! "
15,12,1%,72258,Stan,"Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver. "
15,12,1%,72298,Stan,Yeah. 
15,12,1%,72365,Stan,"Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer? "
15,12,1%,72400,Stan,"[walking out from behind a garage] Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned. "
15,12,1%,72404,Stan,"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! "
15,12,1%,72452,Stan,"Dude, what the hell? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72473,Stan,"We all have to do this report together, dude. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72487,Stan,"Dude, it is called History Channel. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72504,Stan,...What? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72512,Stan,'bout what? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72519,Stan,"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72532,Stan,"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. [smiles] "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72597,Stan,"I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars? "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72599,Stan,I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72605,Stan,Dude! 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72608,Stan,"Yeah, go on dude! "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72613,Stan,I didn't think so. 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72617,Stan,[looking at the driver] Who's this? 
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72631,Stan,"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72695,Stan,"It's cool dude, we understand. "
15,13,A History Channel Thanksgiving,72707,Stan,"Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72754,Stan,Did you hear anything more about what happened? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72756,Stan,We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do. 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72758,Stan,Really? 
15,14,The Poor Kid,72958,Stan,"Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny. "
15,14,The Poor Kid,72967,Stan,...What the fuck?! 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,72970,Stan,"Throw it here! Throw it here! [Clyde throws the ball.] Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! [Clyde's mom shouts through the window.] "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73011,Stan,They are trying to save Clyde's mom. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73013,Stan,They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73062,Stan,We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73068,Stan,So then we can't sue him? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73072,Stan,"Wow, really?! "
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73075,Stan,How expensive? 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73114,Stan,[holds the money] Yeah. 
16,1,Reverse Cowgirl,73171,Stan,So what does that mean? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73241,Stan,[looks away to avoid eye contact] Thanks. [Kyle takes notice] 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73243,Stan,"[annoyed] Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73245,Stan,[angered] It happens to be worth six thousand dollars! 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73247,Stan,Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73249,Stan,"[finally breaks, facepalming] I know! [lowers his right arm] I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73253,Stan,"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73255,Stan,...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73257,Stan,Fifteen bucks?! 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73259,Stan,"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! [takes back the bolo tie] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73262,Stan,Yeah! Here's one. [turns into the next store past the empty lot. The man outside is wearing a signboard] 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73265,Stan,"Yeah dude, you can test them. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73267,Stan,"[stunned, then angry] This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73271,Stan,"I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. [hands the bolo to the clerk. The clerk looks it over, brings out his own pocket scope, and looks it over more closely] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73273,Stan,A six-layer burrito? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73277,Stan,"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73289,Stan,"But, how do they get away with that? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73291,Stan,What are you talking about? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73300,Stan,Grandpa? [gets off the sofa and runs out the front door] 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73303,Stan,Grandpa. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73305,Stan,"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73307,Stan,"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73309,Stan,"Yes, Grandpa. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73311,Stan,"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! [turns to his left and leaves with determination. Marvin is left looking distressed] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73326,Stan,"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73328,Stan,"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself? "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73330,Stan,I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73332,Stan,No I wouldn't. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73334,Stan,"No, because I really want you to kill yourself. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73336,Stan,"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73338,Stan,"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73340,Stan,I'm not joking. [pause] Do it. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73356,Stan,Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do! 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73358,Stan,"Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: ""Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"" "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73365,Stan,"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions! "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73367,Stan,You're not? 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73398,Stan,[railing at an older Indian boy] You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! [Kenny and Kyle are with him] 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73404,Stan,"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa! [the boy reaches for a necklace and offers it to Stan] No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! [the boy thinks about what to do with the necklace, then reaches for a small plastic pouch and puts it in. The boy motions to another boy] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73407,Stan,"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73409,Stan,"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it. "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73411,Stan,"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. [hands him the gift] "
16,2,Cash For Gold,73413,Stan,Yeah. 
16,2,Cash For Gold,73415,Stan,"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73436,Stan,"Tango, Tango, I'm in position. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73438,Stan,It will have to do. We're not getting closer. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73448,Stan,"I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this. [Butters takes a plate from the trolley, which has an iPhone on it, and walks to the left. Meanwhile Kenny comes from the opposite direction, taking the iPhone and passing it to Stan.] I got it. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73453,Stan,"Go, go, go. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73506,Stan,"Oh, that's a good idea. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73517,Stan,"Dude, we are on the front page! "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73520,Stan,"Can we get The Denver Post, please? [hands the clerk two dollars and gets the paper] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73522,Stan,"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73525,Stan,[reads the newspaper] Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73527,Stan,"[continues reading] ""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."" "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73530,Stan,That's all it is? [Kenny moves to the left-hand side] 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73542,Stan,"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73573,Stan,"Well, I'm glad we took care of that. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73576,Stan,That's a cool idea 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73580,Stan,What seems pointless? 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73584,Stan,"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73598,Stan,Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73600,Stan,"[continues to crawl around] Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- [he is confronted by Cartman, Kyle and Kenny] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73602,Stan,"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? [hurriedly puts his pants on] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73605,Stan,"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73608,Stan,"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay? [the boys stop] You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. [Kenny looks down] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73612,Stan,"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. [Kenny pulls down his pants and starts crawling on his butt.] "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73664,Stan,"[has the iPhone in his hands, while Kyle and Kenny stand next to him] Okay, that's good, a little higher. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73667,Stan,"OK, whenever you're ready. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73674,Stan,"Alright, go Cartman. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73677,Stan,"Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73697,Stan,"[the debate goes on. The camera pans to Stan, again in the audience] Fox trot standing by at position alpha. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73701,Stan,Standing by in three seconds. 
16,3,Faith Hilling,73706,Stan,"Come on, dude. Hurry. "
16,3,Faith Hilling,73710,Stan,Wow! 
16,5,Butterballs,73945,Stan,"Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again? "
16,5,Butterballs,73947,Stan,That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher. 
16,5,Butterballs,73949,Stan,Well then write the principal an anonymous letter. 
16,5,Butterballs,73956,Stan,I can't believe what I'm hearing! [three girls walking by hear this and stop] This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore! 
16,5,Butterballs,74026,Stan,I'll do it! I'll be in charge. 
16,5,Butterballs,74028,Stan,"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped. "
16,5,Butterballs,74034,Stan,"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, [takes Clyde and Red and turns them around] over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying? [guides them back into the school] At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight! "
16,5,Butterballs,74045,Stan,"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it. "
16,5,Butterballs,74047,Stan,"Butters, you're the star of the video! "
16,5,Butterballs,74049,Stan,"Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters? [Kyle walks off in a huff] Kyle? "
16,5,Butterballs,74051,Stan,"Kyle? Kyle, dude, where are you going?! "
16,5,Butterballs,74053,Stan,To stop bullying. 
16,5,Butterballs,74055,Stan,YES. 
16,5,Butterballs,74057,Stan,"...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Do you realize that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of- "
16,5,Butterballs,74059,Stan,"Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference! "
16,5,Butterballs,74061,Stan,What the hell does that mean? 
16,5,Butterballs,74072,Stan,"Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video! "
16,5,Butterballs,74074,Stan,"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters! "
16,5,Butterballs,74076,Stan,"I know, right?! [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny all imitate Butters' pain] "
16,5,Butterballs,74079,Stan,"Oh, hey. "
16,5,Butterballs,74081,Stan,Huh? 
16,5,Butterballs,74083,Stan,"But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I- "
16,5,Butterballs,74085,Stan,No. 
16,5,Butterballs,74087,Stan,[Stan Sobbing.] 
16,5,Butterballs,74113,Stan,"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release? "
16,5,Butterballs,74115,Stan,"Butters is totally fine with it, dude. "
16,5,Butterballs,74117,Stan,"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?! "
16,5,Butterballs,74119,Stan,Oh yeah. 
16,5,Butterballs,74121,Stan,"This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle! "
16,5,Butterballs,74123,Stan,"...What, what was the question again? "
16,5,Butterballs,74125,Stan,"...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom! "
16,5,Butterballs,74127,Stan,[left wondering] Why does he keep saying that? 
16,5,Butterballs,74130,Stan,"Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. [the audience applauds] "
16,5,Butterballs,74144,Stan,I didn't know. 
16,5,Butterballs,74146,Stan,I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me! 
16,5,Butterballs,74154,Stan,"Huh? Aw, come on! [comes across Clyde, Craig, and Cartman and stops] Dude, what's going on? "
16,5,Butterballs,74156,Stan,Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it? 
16,5,Butterballs,74160,Stan,How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath? 
16,5,Butterballs,74162,Stan,[moves off a bit] Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago. 
16,5,Butterballs,74164,Stan,"[sighs in resignation] I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74173,Stan,Kyle! [his voice echoes as he looks around frantically] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74181,Stan,"Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! [a shot each of Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman screaming, then of the four boys on a wooden platform at the top of a zip line, then of Cartman, then of a trip through the esophagus, then of Cartman, and back to the first shot] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74184,Stan,[running towards the camera] No! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74186,Stan,Help! We're trapped! [A shot of all four boys bloodied and woozy] We've gotta get out of here! 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74190,Stan,"[being interviewed] We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74197,Stan,"Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74201,Stan,I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74212,Stan,Yeah. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74218,Stan,"[being interviewed] And we were like, ""Other? We have to do this with other people?"" [a shot of the boys entering the waiting room, where there are seven other people waiting] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74224,Stan,[mimicking] Good. How are you? 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74233,Stan,"[being interviewed] It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. [return to the tour] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74238,Stan,"[being interviewed] ""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"" "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74246,Stan,...Shuttle? 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74253,Stan,Uh that's okay. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74262,Stan,Thank God. [everyone is out of the van as Guide 1 goes up to the launch pad two stories up. The pad is attached to a pine tree] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74266,Stan,I think we're good. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74269,Stan,"[being interviewed] So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! [Cartman is hooked up] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74280,Stan,"[as Kyle is prepped] Oh, really?? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74291,Stan,[being interviewed] And it was like WHAM. [makes a fist with his right hand and punches his left handn with it.] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74316,Stan,There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74325,Stan,[being interviewed] That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74328,Stan,"Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74330,Stan,"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74334,Stan,"[being interviewed] So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74337,Stan,"Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going? "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74346,Stan,"[runs up to the tour guides] Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74348,Stan,...Yyyeah. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74351,Stan,"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74358,Stan,"Yea, please! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74361,Stan,You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74378,Stan,"Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74380,Stan,"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74382,Stan,"[being interviewed] I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought ""I can find us a way out!"" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74383,Stan,"[returns from his search quite excited] You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74385,Stan,"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay! "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74387,Stan,Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! [an announcer says the following lines] 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74403,Stan,[being interviewed] The boat went really slow and it just went round and round. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74412,Stan,"...Kenny? Kenny! [Kenny has slid down on the seat, but his eyes are open] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74417,Stan,"[being interviewed] And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!"" "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74418,Stan,[rises and walks a bit] Stop it! It was me! My idea. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74420,Stan,"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out the brochure for Backcountry Adventures, then looks at it for a few seconds] I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. [Kyle and Cartman look at each other] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74422,Stan,"[turns to face them] If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. [the camera pans down and sure enough, the offer is on the brochure cover: Sign up 3 friends and get an iPod NANO!!!] "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74424,Stan,I had no idea ziplining would be so boring. 
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74428,Stan,"[being interviewed, crying] The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back. [wipes away the flowing tears] I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere. "
16,6,I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining,74433,Stan,"Thank you. [whispers] Mr. Hankey. [Mr. Hankey has landed on the boat, at the top of an armrest] "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74442,Stan,What? [most of the fourth grade boys gather around] 
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74575,Stan,"Dude, why are you so into their relationship? "
16,7,Cartman Finds Love,74585,Stan,"Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74742,Stan,"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74749,Stan,"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74765,Stan,"Dad, do we really have to wear bras? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74784,Stan,This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team! 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74818,Stan,"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74820,Stan,[stops and faces his friends] I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously. 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74827,Stan,"[walks up to Butters] The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory. "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74831,Stan,Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know? 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74907,Stan,"Cartman, you idiot! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74936,Stan,Dad? 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74938,Stan,What? 
16,8,Sarcastaball,74943,Stan,"Whoa, whoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74946,Stan,"Oh, right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets! "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74950,Stan,"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere? "
16,8,Sarcastaball,74953,Stan,"Yeah Dad. You need some of this. [walks forward and gives him a small bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo. Randy takes it and opens it, looking at the contents, then drinks it] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74967,Stan,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,74973,Stan,Whoa duude! 
16,9,Raising the Bar,74978,Stan,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. [Indeed, a small fleet of them are available for rent, at $19.99 each. They're labeled as electric wheelchairs. Obese people are in line as one after another of them rents a Rascal. The boys turn a corner to have a look at the Rascals as they're being rented] "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75025,Stan,"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75032,Stan,"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing. "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75086,Stan,"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do? "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75088,Stan,"[alarmed, gets up and walks up to Kyle] Dude! Dude, not cool! "
16,9,Raising the Bar,75090,Stan,Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out. 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75092,Stan,Yeah dude. It's really serious. 
16,9,Raising the Bar,75150,Stan,"Dude, you okay? [Honey Boo Boo gets up, and Cartman turns back to strike her down again] "
16,10,Insecurity,75194,Stan,"Dude, what happened? "
16,10,Insecurity,75196,Stan,What's this? [Takes the sheet and looks at it.] 
16,10,Insecurity,75198,Stan,Whoa! 
16,10,Insecurity,75201,Stan,"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex? [Randy sees a plant nearby, quickly dumps his coffee into it, and puts the cup against Stan's door] "
16,10,Insecurity,75204,Stan,Well are you gonna tell your dad? 
16,10,Insecurity,75209,Stan,"Cartman dude, not now. "
16,10,Insecurity,75354,Stan,"You're gonna have to tell him, dude. "
16,11,Going Native,75442,Stan,What? 
16,11,Going Native,75446,Stan,You're talking about Butters. 
16,11,Going Native,75449,Stan,Butters? 
16,11,Going Native,75451,Stan,"Butters, come out here. "
16,11,Going Native,75496,Stan,Hawaii? 
16,11,Going Native,75499,Stan,"[turns to the basket] After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. [makes a shot at close range] "
16,11,Going Native,75543,Stan,"[reading the letter] ""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75667,Stan,[gets his gift] We're rich? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75671,Stan,[somewhat confused] Blockbuster Video? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75677,Stan,"Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. [they reach their destination and exit the car, and have a look at the place] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75683,Stan,It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75714,Stan,"[turns and walks to Sharon, who's at the counter looking up things on the ancient CRT monitor] I think something might be wrong with Dad? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75729,Stan,"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75731,Stan,"[takes up the shield and strikes a pose] Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75741,Stan,"[disappointed] Dad, nobody's gonna come. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75743,Stan,Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75745,Stan,"[moments later, on the land line] I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75747,Stan,"I know, but there's nothing I can do. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75752,Stan,I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75754,Stan,"No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75756,Stan,"Oh never mind, I hate him again. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75758,Stan,Yeah. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75762,Stan,"How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75765,Stan,"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75768,Stan,Trick or treat. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75800,Stan,Trick or treat. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75806,Stan,What? What's he doing? 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75810,Stan,"Hey, where did you guys go? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75812,Stan,"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75835,Stan,Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75838,Stan,"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad! [the robber scratches the glass, leaving a deep gash] Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75840,Stan,No no! We weren't gonna go there! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75842,Stan,"NO! [shakes his head] I won't say anything, I promise! [Robbers 2 and 3 take the iPad out to the car] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75844,Stan,What are you gonna do? [Robber 3 takes the iPad out and carries it away] Please! Please just let me go! No! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75847,Stan,What the hell? [gets off the stool and walks over to Shelly] Shelly I need to use your cell phone. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75857,Stan,"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75859,Stan,"Oh, ah thank God you found me. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75861,Stan,You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! [Ben and his girl look at each other] 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75869,Stan,They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75871,Stan,"Guys, you're okay! "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75873,Stan,"It's all right, just a scratch. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75875,Stan,"No! They're looking for you there! [to Sgt. Yates] Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75879,Stan,"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75888,Stan,"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75890,Stan,Oops. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75892,Stan,"Hey, be careful in there. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75894,Stan,"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75902,Stan,Wait a minute. There they are! 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75904,Stan,"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- [some rustling is heard and Randy takes Stan's iPad from him] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75920,Stan,"[gaining control of his own iPad] It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! [Officer 3 takes the iPad off and throws it away while he keeps getting shot, and finally falls over dead. The gunfire stops] "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75927,Stan,Hey dude. 
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75929,Stan,"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK. [Kyle does so, and the indicator disappears] You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me. "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75931,Stan,"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny? "
16,12,A Nightmare on Face Time,75933,Stan,"Stay gold. [the iPad runs out of juice and the screen goes black, except for some symbols indicating the iPad needs to be recharged. Cartman roars like Hulk in agony.] "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75964,Stan,"It's all right, Dad. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75976,Stan,"All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75979,Stan,Yeah I know. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75983,Stan,"Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75989,Stan,"I don't know, [looks at his wristband] I just like it. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75991,Stan,"Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75995,Stan,...I don't know. [checks his wristband again] I like it. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,75999,Stan,"No, I just, I don' know. No. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76004,Stan,I have? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76006,Stan,You're wearing a bracelet to think of me? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76010,Stan,"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76012,Stan,...Farmers in where? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76016,Stan,"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76019,Stan,"Wow, this is happening so fast. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76022,Stan,"[looking out over a river from a stone bridge] My friends told me I was crazy, [jogging down a sidewalk in a Nike jogging suit] that I was wasting my time. [holding court at a press conference. Cameras all around him take pictures] But my cause is to stand my ground. [sits in a park, then stands up as the sun sets] When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand... [faces the sun and raises his left arm, still wearing the bracelet. It begins to glow] for standing. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76025,Stan,No thanks. I'll stand. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76028,Stan,I'm good. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76031,Stan,"Tell the captain to take off. [At the gym] People ask me, ""You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"" [outside, with a sunset behind him] No. Never. Not. Ever. [Three phrases pop up onscreen: ""STAN for something. STAN up. STAN ground.""] What do I do? I Stan ground. [a double swoosh appears onscreen] "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76035,Stan,For what? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76040,Stan,No! This is stupid! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76043,Stan,No! I never cut if off! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76050,Stan,"What's the big idea, Craig?! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76052,Stan,You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76055,Stan,"You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76057,Stan,"And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76059,Stan,"Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76068,Stan,Yeah. [the door opens and Kyle enters] 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76070,Stan,Thanks Kyle. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76072,Stan,Why does it matter?! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76074,Stan,"You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76076,Stan,"[hops off his bed and walks over to his desk] Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76078,Stan,"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?! [Kyle looks around at all the Nike merchandise] This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76098,Stan,Jesus! 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76100,Stan,What are you doing here? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76105,Stan,"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76107,Stan,"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76110,Stan,It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76112,Stan,"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76115,Stan,"Thanks a lot. [the scientist turns around and leaves.] Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76117,Stan,"NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76119,Stan,"Pff it's like, that's here [puts his hand up, palm down, about two inches above the bread] and... "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76121,Stan,"Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important! "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76123,Stan,Exactly! People don't even know where it is. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76125,Stan,How can we raise awareness? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76129,Stan,"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets... "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76131,Stan,Our... scause? 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76135,Stan,"Dude, the hell just happen? "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76146,Stan,People are saying that? [pleased] 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76148,Stan,"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76150,Stan,[looks heavenward] We did it. [Butters goes around a corner and out of view] 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76173,Stan,[glares at Kyle] Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! [a bouncy noise is heard] 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76179,Stan,"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along. "
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76181,Stan,We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76183,Stan,Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money. 
16,13,A Scause For Applause,76185,Stan,"[after a long while] What would Jesus do? [Rocky fanfare plays and Jesus slowly gets energized. He gets off the sofa and walks to the dining room table, reaches into his robe and pulls out a big bottle of HGH. He plants it on the table and opens it. He pours some into the cap and drinks it. He transforms into a superhuman and flips the dining room table over. He turns and breaks through the front wall, obliterating the front door, and runs off to find the charlatan. Stan looks on] Yeheah! [Jesus goes to the Scauses factory and flips over every truck he finds in his way, then bursts into the factory. He beats up all the workers there] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76286,Stan,"Wow, really? That's pretty impressive. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76288,Stan,But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76290,Stan,I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76301,Stan,Is that an M&M? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76306,Stan,Pry his mouth open! 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76335,Stan,What'd he say? [Kenny mumbles his reply and Stan understands that] Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76342,Stan,Huh? 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76350,Stan,"Oh, Red Lobster. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76365,Stan,"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman: [Freeman turns around and faces the group] How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76376,Stan,"There's nothing here, Kyle. [Jimmy walks in from the dining room] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76383,Stan,He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President. 
16,14,Obama Wins!,76386,Stan,"Oh my God you guys, look! [points across the street. The boys walk out as the sound of a large vehicle is heard] Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! [Indeed. The ship arrives and positions itself for landing, then descends onto the road. After a big thud, the ship's door opens... and out swaggers Mickey Mouse] "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76388,Stan,"Aw shit, it's him again. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76431,Stan,"Well, we tried, dude. "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76433,Stan,"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76436,Stan,"Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer? "
16,14,Obama Wins!,76437,Stan,"Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010? "
17,1,"Let Go, Let Gov",76530,Stan,Wow. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76728,Stan,You guys are watchin' murder porn? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76732,Stan,Okaaay. [turns around and walks out. Sharon switches back to the show] 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76735,Stan,What's up dude? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76737,Stan,"Uh, yeah, the first grader? "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76740,Stan,What?! 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76743,Stan,What happened? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76764,Stan,[miffed] What? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76766,Stan,You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. [closes his eyes] 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76829,Stan,That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76831,Stan,What? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76834,Stan,"Butters, what happened? "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76839,Stan,In Minecraft. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76843,Stan,Whattaya mean? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76867,Stan,"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. [police sirens are heard] "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76880,Stan,"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76884,Stan,"What, dude? "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76886,Stan,So? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76890,Stan,Aha! [the boys reach the floor] 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76895,Stan,"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76905,Stan,"No no, [whips out a list and reads it] just ID Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn. "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76907,Stan,"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want? "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76912,Stan,We want specific networks dropped from our cable. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76920,Stan,"No, that's way too long! "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76923,Stan,"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other! [the men stop rubbing] Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it? "
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76925,Stan,What? 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76927,Stan,I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76929,Stan,I... said it would really bum them out. 
17,2,Informative Murder Porn,76936,Stan,"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad. "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76974,Stan,Is he doing it again? 
17,3,World War Zimmerman,76979,Stan,"Cartman, are you feeling alright? "
17,3,World War Zimmerman,77218,Stan,That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse. 
17,5,Taming Strange,77608,Stan,He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77903,Stan,How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77917,Stan,[enunciating] What the fuck? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77944,Stan,Hey Kyle. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77946,Stan,"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77948,Stan,"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77950,Stan,You like... how they smell? How they taste? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77952,Stan,They're really that good? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77954,Stan,Should I try them? 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77962,Stan,"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77965,Stan,"I don't get it, Kenny. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77967,Stan,"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77990,Stan,"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77995,Stan,Hey Kyle. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,77997,Stan,"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,77999,Stan,"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78001,Stan,All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else! 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78003,Stan,See? You sound like a dick. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78005,Stan,"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick. "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78008,Stan,I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78010,Stan,"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78020,Stan,"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been [Stan's phone rings] So- sorry, hang on. [pulls the phone out of his jacket pocket and answers it.] Hello? "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78022,Stan,"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78024,Stan,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78027,Stan,"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle! "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78029,Stan,"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"" "
17,6,Ginger Cow,78031,Stan,You should apologize to Kenny too. 
17,6,Ginger Cow,78035,Stan,The red cow... I saw it too. It came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle. 
17,7,Black Friday,78076,Stan,[stands on his chair] It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have? 
17,7,Black Friday,78093,Stan,The House of Greyhawk? 
17,7,Black Friday,78139,Stan,I like the PS4's controller better. 
17,7,Black Friday,78141,Stan,"[tears welling up] The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because... [gets mad] because that's how XBox people are. "
17,7,Black Friday,78143,Stan,"[determined] If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside. "
17,7,Black Friday,78208,Stan,"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s? "
17,7,Black Friday,78212,Stan,Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall! 
17,7,Black Friday,78214,Stan,"No, you can't do that! "
17,7,Black Friday,78216,Stan,"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS. "
17,7,Black Friday,78218,Stan,Exactly! 
17,7,Black Friday,78220,Stan,"...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in! "
17,7,Black Friday,78249,Stan,And who do we have on our side? 
17,7,Black Friday,78251,Stan,Did you ask the Vamp kids? 
17,7,Black Friday,78253,Stan,"[walks towards the tent's entrance] There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. [looks at the campfire outside, around which sit Tweek and two other boys] "
17,7,Black Friday,78257,Stan,So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest? 
17,7,Black Friday,78286,Stan,"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own! [the army is shown, and it includes the Goths, the Vamps, the handicapped kids, and some first graders. The house behind them only has one story, and it looks run down. A security grill is falling off one of the windows and the fence is in tatters. The army cheers for itself] I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided. [more cheering. A familiar figure sits on a throne...] Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! [he turns around and unsheathes his sword, raising it to honor the new leader]All hail the Princess! [points the sword at her, and more cheering follows. Princess Kenny, Lady McCormick, has arrived] "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78445,Stan,Let them pass! [the PS4 army makes way for the XBox army. Cartman is carried over to Kenny's throne] 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78447,Stan,[translating] The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose. [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig] 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78450,Stan,"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it. "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78453,Stan,The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian. 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78456,Stan,What I started? How dare you! 
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78458,Stan,"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing! "
17,8,A Song of Ass and Fire,78460,Stan,The gods will find us a way! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78568,Stan,"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here. [points to the location] Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. [points to a location outside cardboard Red Robin] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78571,Stan,The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78573,Stan,I have no idea. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78575,Stan,Yes? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78577,Stan,"What? [moments later, outside, Stan walks towards Cartman as the two armies face each other] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78584,Stan,"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. [turns around and walks away] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78589,Stan,And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78591,Stan,"[turns around] Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. [as he walks away with Jimmy and Craig, the camera reveals that Kyle had his fingers on the hand behind his back crossed during the swear.] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78616,Stan,"Yeah, sure, what about it? "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78618,Stan,Why? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78620,Stan,"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78626,Stan,Who is that? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78632,Stan,Did Kyle know about this? 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78634,Stan,Did Kyle know about this?! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78669,Stan,"[startled out of his sleep] Huh? Hello? Who is that? [next to him is a glass of milk, a sandwich with a bite in it, and a tin cup] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78671,Stan,Get out of here! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78673,Stan,You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78675,Stan,"[stands and turns to address Kyle] I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78677,Stan,...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78679,Stan,You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78681,Stan,"Get out of here! I'm done with you! [grabs the tin cup and raps it against his bedroom 'jail cell' door as in classic prison movies] Mom! Mom! [Kyle stands up straight] Get him out of here! [Sharon arrives, and Kyle back away from the door] Get him out! [Kyle leaves] "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78732,Stan,We're done with betrayals! It's time to put an end to this! 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78740,Stan,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block. [stops between the two presidents] Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad? [throws his sword at the Sony president] Then you fucking fight! "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78762,Stan,[flatly] Yay. 
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78774,Stan,"Yes, it is. "
17,9,Titties and Dragons,78780,Stan,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78892,Stan,"Yeah, dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics. [Wendy walks up to them, mad] She got really hot all of a sudden. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78895,Stan,"Oh, hey, Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78899,Stan,She looks pretty hot here. 
17,10,The Hobbit,78960,Stan,"Hey, Wendy, uh, can I ask you a big favor? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78962,Stan,"A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are. "
17,10,The Hobbit,78964,Stan,"Wendy, why is it such a big deal? "
17,10,The Hobbit,78966,Stan,[looks down] I do? [kids begin to walk by] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79026,Stan,Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79034,Stan,Nah. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79036,Stan,[passively] Uh huh. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79038,Stan,Angry Clit Spasm 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79040,Stan,Whooping Fart Balls. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79042,Stan,Lubricated Titty Burgers. 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79044,Stan,[frustrated] Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79054,Stan,"Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79057,Stan,"No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79059,Stan,"No, we don't wanna do anything. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79063,Stan,"...Nnnno, there isn't. [turns back to his computer and fleshes out the project] "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79066,Stan,What? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79072,Stan,"I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79074,Stan,[lowers his head and strokes his chin] Washington Redskins. [raises his head] I like it! 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79081,Stan,[walks up to Kyle] You alright dude? 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79088,Stan,What?! [Cartman walks up to Butters] 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79145,Stan,"I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79178,Stan,Yeah... 
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79180,Stan,"I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."" "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79182,Stan,"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""? "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79184,Stan,"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79186,Stan,"I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79188,Stan,"Good luck with your company, dude. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79219,Stan,"It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here. [walks up to the boys] Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other. "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79224,Stan,"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out, "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79261,Stan,"Boy, this is the life, huh guys? "
18,1,Go Fund Yourself,79270,Stan,But you all thought our name was sweet. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79282,Stan,Morning! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79296,Stan,[walks up] Hey Wendy. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79298,Stan,"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79300,Stan,"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie- "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79302,Stan,"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79304,Stan,Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? [Wendy closes her locker and faces him] 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79343,Stan,[joins them on the floor] For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79348,Stan,"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79352,Stan,"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. [Pink's ""Get This Party Started"" begins to play, which serves as transitional music to the next scene] "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79359,Stan,"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79370,Stan,Sweet! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79373,Stan,Excuse me? 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79406,Stan,"Wait, wait, ah I might need those. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79438,Stan,We can't let our party suck. 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79441,Stan,"[looks down, then] I'll be back. [turns and leaves] "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79480,Stan,Dad? Dad! 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79482,Stan,"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79484,Stan,"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79487,Stan,"Nonono, not yet. DAD! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79490,Stan,"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79492,Stan,Let me talk to my dad! [the soldier finally hauls him away] 
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79528,Stan,"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79537,Stan,"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but- "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79542,Stan,"Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now... "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79544,Stan,"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid! "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79585,Stan,"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun? "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79587,Stan,"Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me. "
18,2,Gluten Free Ebola,79589,Stan,What does that mean? 
18,3,The Cissy,79711,Stan,What is that? 
18,3,The Cissy,79713,Stan,Cartman's a girl now? 
18,3,The Cissy,79753,Stan,[surprised] What? 
18,3,The Cissy,79762,Stan,Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you. 
18,3,The Cissy,79764,Stan,"Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside? [Randy sighs deeply and stands up to walk] I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex? "
18,3,The Cissy,79766,Stan,...What? 
18,3,The Cissy,79768,Stan,Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle. 
18,3,The Cissy,79770,Stan,"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you? "
18,3,The Cissy,79772,Stan,"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl. "
18,3,The Cissy,79774,Stan,"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good. "
18,3,The Cissy,79778,Stan,...I don't know where I belong... 
18,3,The Cissy,79784,Stan,"I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused. "
18,3,The Cissy,79819,Stan,To the bathroom? 
18,3,The Cissy,79821,Stan,"Wow, this is is pretty nice. [drops trousers and settles in, then begins singing]  Feelin' good on a Monday. Got my space, all the freedom I need. Yah yah yah By myself, yah yah yah   "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80158,Stan,"Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know? "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80160,Stan,I know. [they take their places next to Cartman] 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80162,Stan,"Sup? [the pressure gets to Cartman, but he resists. He finally cracks] "
18,5,The Magic Bush,80165,Stan,What? 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80171,Stan,Let me see. 
18,5,The Magic Bush,80173,Stan,How'd you get that on your phone? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80390,Stan,I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80392,Stan,You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80394,Stan,"I'll pay you back for it, okay?! "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80396,Stan,"I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ! "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80418,Stan,Ohhh hey guys. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80420,Stan,"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80422,Stan,"Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80424,Stan,"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. [smiles] "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80426,Stan,"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80428,Stan,"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80476,Stan,It's just... 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80478,Stan,"Yeah, it's fun. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80482,Stan,"Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80498,Stan,"...Free? [puts his pillow back on the mattress, grabs the phone and starts playing again] "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80501,Stan,"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80503,Stan,One? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80505,Stan,"No, no, it's not. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80507,Stan,I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80510,Stan,"Okay, I need help. [sometime later Cartman, Kenny and Jimmy arrive, and Stan picks up where he left off. The conversation moves to the living room, and Kyle gives Stan a comforting tap on the right shoulder] There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80514,Stan,It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80516,Stan,How? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80535,Stan,"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? [a bright, fiery light appears behind him and he turns to look at it. Satan emerges from it] "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80537,Stan,"Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80539,Stan,Okay. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80541,Stan,So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80543,Stan,So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything? 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80545,Stan,The addict people said something about me filling a hole. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80547,Stan,"Yeah, no, this is great. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80564,Stan,"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80568,Stan,"That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. [Satan taps the screen, stands up, and plays the game] "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80572,Stan,"Ah, Canada? "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80574,Stan,...Okay. [Satan proceeds to possess Stan] Aaaaahhh! 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80578,Stan,[with Satan's voice] I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. [continues out the door] 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80596,Stan,Hey. 
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80598,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. [turns away and walks off the court] "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80603,Stan,"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80606,Stan,"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80608,Stan,"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking. "
18,6,Freemium Isn't Free,80610,Stan,"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. [Marvin takes the dice and rolls them] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80614,Stan,"[holding Butters off] Butters, what the hell are you doing? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80642,Stan,Sound pretty typical to me. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80646,Stan,Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80792,Stan,"Kyle, maybe this is for real. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80794,Stan,"In on what? [thinks a moment...] Ohh, [slowly] Fuck you! "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80808,Stan,"""Fuck you"" what? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80810,Stan,Oh fuck you! 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80857,Stan,"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! [the door opens and Cartman and Kyle walk in] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80859,Stan,"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80861,Stan,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80864,Stan,How do you know? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80870,Stan,What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80872,Stan,Butters called Customer Service first? 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80874,Stan,"Come on, we're going to Butters' house! [they leave Kenny behind] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80891,Stan,Butters. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80897,Stan,So now we are in the real world. 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80905,Stan,"Yes, we're here. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80908,Stan,"[as Stephen chews Butters out, puts some distance between them and himself] Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80910,Stan,"What?! [Stephen unbuckles his belt, Butters holds a hand up] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80912,Stan,"That doesn't make sense! [Stephen takes his belt off. Butters closes his eyes, knowing what's coming] "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80915,Stan,"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!! [Stephen disappears, then Butters, then Kyle, then Cartman] You guys? Are you there? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80917,Stan,Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. [leaves Butters' room. Stephen and Linda never really left the dining room table/ Stephen senses a change in mood] 
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80929,Stan,"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there? "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80931,Stan,"[goes upstairs and enters Cartman's room] Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room. "
18,7,Grounded Vindaloop,80935,Stan,"[thoughtfully looking at the headset] It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80948,Stan,"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball. [he, Kenny, and Kyle laugh] "
18,8,Cock Magic,80953,Stan,Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked. 
18,8,Cock Magic,80959,Stan,Shhh! 
18,8,Cock Magic,80961,Stan,What's that? 
18,8,Cock Magic,80963,Stan,This late? 
18,8,Cock Magic,80973,Stan,It was seriously almost hard to watch. [Wendy appears in the distance and walks over to the boys] 
18,8,Cock Magic,80975,Stan,"[sees Wendy] Wendy, did you hear about last night? "
18,8,Cock Magic,80977,Stan,Not that. Did you actually go to that? 
18,8,Cock Magic,80979,Stan,"Pfft, whatever. "
18,8,Cock Magic,80984,Stan,We're men. 
18,8,Cock Magic,80992,Stan,"Uhhh, Mitchell the Janitor sent us? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81007,Stan,That was freakin' hardcore. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81009,Stan,It was just decimation. 
18,8,Cock Magic,81012,Stan,"Hell yeah! [Kenny lowers his head, and Cartman notices] "
18,8,Cock Magic,81015,Stan,What's mean about it? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81019,Stan,"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81025,Stan,"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81038,Stan,"Dad, it's not that big a deal. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81043,Stan,"Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81053,Stan,Do you think they're happy? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81055,Stan,"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81060,Stan,"[off-screen] Hey, how about this little guy? "
18,8,Cock Magic,81089,Stan,Yeah! 
18,8,Cock Magic,81098,Stan,"Gee, thanks! "
18,8,Cock Magic,81113,Stan,"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81124,Stan,"Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81156,Stan,[following the cock Magic fight over the phone] What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81160,Stan,Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?! 
18,8,Cock Magic,81177,Stan,What did he play? Did he tap all his mana? 
18,8,Cock Magic,81181,Stan,"Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! [meanwhile, the ball goes to #36, who hits it back over the net] "
18,8,Cock Magic,81208,Stan,"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys. "
18,8,Cock Magic,81210,Stan,A way to finally do something good for other people. 
18,9,REHASH,81257,Stan,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting. 
18,9,REHASH,81265,Stan,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting. 
18,9,REHASH,81294,Stan,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting. 
18,9,REHASH,81306,Stan,What are you talking about? 
18,9,REHASH,81328,Stan,"Hey, what's up? "
18,9,REHASH,81330,Stan,"Oh no, what now? "
18,9,REHASH,81332,Stan,Yeah? 
18,9,REHASH,81343,Stan,"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on! "
18,9,REHASH,81345,Stan,Grandpa? 
18,9,REHASH,81349,Stan,"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?! "
18,9,REHASH,81351,Stan,We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool! 
18,9,REHASH,81387,Stan,"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad? "
18,9,REHASH,81435,Stan,Tell me about it. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81550,Stan,[texting] Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81552,Stan,Who did? 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81554,Stan,"That's a little strange, isn't it? "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81567,Stan,That self-promoting asshole! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81569,Stan,Because my dad's an idiot! 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81571,Stan,"Nnnothing, nothing. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81617,Stan,"We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81620,Stan,"Yeah, you damn kids! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81648,Stan,"Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere! "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81650,Stan,"Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! [walks forward as his anger drains away] Lorde is my dad. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81653,Stan,He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81656,Stan,It just all seemed so... stupid. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81686,Stan,"Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81690,Stan,What?? [both he and Kyle are scared] 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81722,Stan,Dude. You're such a grandpa. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81803,Stan,"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about. "
18,10,HappyHolograms,81805,Stan,Yeah. 
18,10,HappyHolograms,81807,Stan,"Yeah, I think that's great too. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81828,Stan,"[looking around] Man, I guess things are going to be different around here. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81894,Stan,"But, this isn't you, Cartman. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81897,Stan,Right! And what does Tom Brady do after breaking the rules? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81899,Stan,Yeah! 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81959,Stan,Cartman? 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,81965,Stan,Yeah. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82015,Stan,"Dude, what happened? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82017,Stan,"Hang on. [walks to the kitchen] Dad, did you draw dicks on my friend's face? "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82019,Stan,"That's my best friend, Dad! Stop shaming him because you want to fit in! "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82021,Stan,"[returns] Look, Kyle, maybe you should just say Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. "
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82024,Stan,Her. 
19,1,Stunning and Brave,82066,Stan,"So I guess PC Principal is here to stay, huh? "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82104,Stan,What are they doing now? [several tables have Canadian kids seated and eating. Butters stands up for a better look] 
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82114,Stan,"You did kind of go overboard, dude. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82116,Stan,"It's just... I know you like giving speeches and stuff, but not everything is black and white. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82125,Stan,"[briefly puts his left hand over his nose] Oh boy, here we go again. [the other boys leave as well] "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82145,Stan,"Dude, the Canadians are pissed off. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82150,Stan,"That doesn't matter. We have to think of a way to smooth this over, fast. "
19,2,Where My Country Gone?,82300,Stan,Unbelievable! [Kyle turns left and walks off stage] 
19,3,The City Part of Town,82307,Stan,So not cool. How does someone just rip on us like that? 
19,3,The City Part of Town,82314,Stan,I just hope somebody finds a way to fix this. 
19,4,You're Not Yelping,82571,Stan,Stop it. 
19,5,Safe Space,82978,Stan,"Dude, Butters! [he and Kyle give chase. Butters goes up a flight of stairs] "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83026,Stan,"I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83030,Stan,And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83069,Stan,"I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83071,Stan,I just don't understand how it's decided. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83073,Stan,"No, I mean, like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay? "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83075,Stan,So you've heard of yaoi? 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83114,Stan,And so my dad talked to me about it. 
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83116,Stan,"And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, to make people gay. "
19,6,Tweek x Craig,83190,Stan,But why? 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83341,Stan,Who? 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83353,Stan,You and Kenny built all this?

19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83437,Stan,What? 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83442,Stan,How's they found out who we were?

19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83475,Stan,That's Clyde. 
19,7,Naughty Ninjas,83496,Stan,What shall we do with him? [Barbrady climbs over a wall and quickly reaches the ninjas]

19,8,Sponsored Content,83542,Stan,[to Kyle] Again? 
19,8,Sponsored Content,83547,Stan,"Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper. [points to his right. PC Principal turns left and faces... Jimmy. PC Principal is speechless.] You gonna break his legs, PC Principal? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83806,Stan,"No, I don't. [Randy lowers his head and looks at his food,] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83826,Stan,"Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? [shows him the paper, which has a report on PC Principal sending Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83828,Stan,"It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83830,Stan,"You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83832,Stan,What's that supposed to mean? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83834,Stan,That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together! 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83840,Stan,You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83842,Stan,"[the boys look at each other] Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. [they head out] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83894,Stan,I think it was Vermont. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83896,Stan,That's an ad for skiing in Vermont. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83901,Stan,Just click out of it. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83903,Stan,That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83907,Stan,Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can- [a popup ad for Victor Frankenstein appears] Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83909,Stan,"Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83916,Stan,"Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83918,Stan,But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83960,Stan,Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83962,Stan,No. That's not what we set out to do. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83965,Stan,"No, we didn't. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83967,Stan,"Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,83969,Stan,Why are you looking at me? 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84018,Stan,"Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed? "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84020,Stan,"He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- [Kyle arrives with his lunch and sits next to him. Butters is stunned that Kyle showed up] "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84025,Stan,"Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal. "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84027,Stan,I don't know. 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84031,Stan,"My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle! "
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84034,Stan,Don't you dare call me a Cartman! 
19,9,Truth and Advertising,84036,Stan,"Fuck you, Kyle! [delivers a left hook and Kyle falls off the lunch bench] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84092,Stan,"Alright Kyle, what's this about? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84098,Stan,How do you know all this? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84104,Stan,Kyle! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84106,Stan,"[gets in his face] You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! [walks past him, opens the doors, and walks out] "

19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84125,Stan,"Dad, where were you last night? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84127,Stan,Work on what? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84183,Stan,Principal Victoria? [the adults take notice] Mr. Garrison? Caitlyn Jenner? 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84185,Stan,"Tell me what's going on, Dad? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84187,Stan,[pulls out his gun and aims it at the adults. The adults hold their hands up] No! I wanna know what the hell is going on right now! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84189,Stan,"Kyle said I couldn't trust you! What are you planning, Dad? "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84191,Stan,Then what is it?! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84193,Stan,I'm gonna go tell Mom! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84195,Stan,[runs out of the garage] Mom! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84221,Stan,"Because you wouldn't talk to me, Dad! "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84227,Stan,[shifts his aim from Randy to Shelly] She doesn't always take my side! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84234,Stan,"We all need to be better to each other! [Shelly shifts her aim to Stan, then to Randy, and then to Sharon] "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84237,Stan,"[lowers his gun] We love you too, Dad. [Shelly lowers hers] We just wanna know what's going on with you. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84274,Stan,Wait... That's Leslie. [walks away from the table] Oh my God... It's Kyle. 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84276,Stan,"Kyle has been protecting Leslie. They're together. He's been making everyone feel paranoid and saying you're the enemy, Dad. "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84281,Stan,Yeah! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84320,Stan,"Fuck you, Kyle! You're the enemy! "
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84332,Stan,So now we know who got Principal Victoria fired! 
19,10,PC Principal Final Justice,84356,Stan,This is going to be really hard. 
20,1,Member Berries,84432,Stan,Hhhawgh! 
20,1,Member Berries,84434,Stan,I just don't understand why every four years you people freak out over whether to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich. 
20,1,Member Berries,84436,Stan,Why are we doing this again? Why are we back to giant douche and turd sandwich? 
20,1,Member Berries,84438,Stan,It's nihilist. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84605,Stan,Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84607,Stan,"Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84609,Stan,"No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84619,Stan,"Okay. Can we all agree now, [Stan glares at Cartman] that whoever is doing this, needs to stop? "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84621,Stan,"So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84672,Stan,Clyde's right. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84674,Stan,What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84679,Stan,We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84683,Stan,"After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play Counter-Strike all night with no one around to bother us. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84685,Stan,"Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84715,Stan,Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much. 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84754,Stan,"You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry. "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84769,Stan,What have we done? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84800,Stan,You didn't hear? 
20,2,Skank Hunt,84802,Stan,"The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night! "
20,2,Skank Hunt,84804,Stan,It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason. [Cartman walks past looking down] We can't undo what we've done. 
20,3,The Damned,84859,Stan,"What happened, Dad? [Randy walks up to the bed] Everything's upside down. [Randy sits] Everyone's taking sides and splitting into groups. [thoughtfully] Everything sucks. "
20,4,Wieners Out,85063,Stan,You really think that's gonna make a difference? 
20,4,Wieners Out,85092,Stan,Yeah! This is a pretty sweet turnout! 
20,4,Wieners Out,85139,Stan,[pulls down his pants and joins the rally] 
20,5,Douche and a Danish,85396,Stan,Mr. Garrison? 
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85948,Stan,"I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. I know that the election didn't go the way you'd hoped. What I want to say is, I'm sorry. [Wendy is shown facing him across the table] I know that girls have gone through a lot lately, and I just want you to know that... I'm here for you. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85950,Stan,"I am gonna change. I, I am. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85952,Stan,"Yeah well, but I, but I want her to take me back. "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85954,Stan,"Okay, look. The bottom line is, you still have to have faith... in boys, because... because I miss you, Wendy. [some knocking nearby. Stan and Wendy look in the direction of the knocking] "
20,7,"Oh, Jeez",85956,Stan,Go away Butters! [Cosby leans back to see what's going on] 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86602,Stan,For what? 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86604,Stan,[Pumped up] Okay! 
20,10,The End of Serialization as We Know It,86796,Stan,"Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town. "
21,1,White People Renovating Houses,86986,Stan,"Uhwell, I think uhh, I think I got some stuff to do at home. [the boys start to leave as one] "
21,2,Put It Down,87237,Stan,"He's your boyfriend, dude. "
21,2,Put It Down,87277,Stan,[looks back at her] Yeah? 
21,2,Put It Down,87279,Stan,Cartman? Okay. 
21,2,Put It Down,87281,Stan,What do you mean? 
21,2,Put It Down,87283,Stan,[stunned] What?? 
21,2,Put It Down,87285,Stan,Wait. Cartman said he was going to kill himself? 
21,2,Put It Down,87287,Stan,Totally. 
21,2,Put It Down,87289,Stan,Shhh. [plays the voice message Heidi sent him] 
21,2,Put It Down,87357,Stan,"Yeah, you didn't hear? Gary Borkovec got ran over by a distracted driver. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87495,Stan,What the hell is going on? 
21,3,Holiday Special,87501,Stan,"Dude, what asshole would take away a holiday? "
21,3,Holiday Special,87507,Stan,Hey dude. 
21,3,Holiday Special,87509,Stan,"Yeah. Dude, I don't know what's going on. He's really serious about this. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87511,Stan,I can't get him to back down. 
21,3,Holiday Special,87513,Stan,"I'll try, okay. [glances up for a moment] Ok-I, I gotta go. [Randy walks up with his laptop and phone and sits next to Stan] "
21,3,Holiday Special,87515,Stan,"Dad, listen: you need to ease off a little here. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87517,Stan,"Dad, come on. We all get your point, but don't you think you're overdoing it? "
21,3,Holiday Special,87529,Stan,[shows up at table with his lunch] Hey guys. [takes a seat between Tolkien and Jimmy] 
21,3,Holiday Special,87531,Stan,"Look, I tried talking to him, alright? He's just really against all the things Columbus did. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87545,Stan,Hey Dad? 
21,3,Holiday Special,87547,Stan,"But Dad, Kyle found a picture on Instagram. [shows Randy the pictures] It pretty much looks like you dressed as Columbus at a Halloween party. [Randy notices the picture, now shown close up] "
21,3,Holiday Special,87549,Stan,"If you hate Columbus so much, why did you dress like him? "
21,3,Holiday Special,87551,Stan,"Yeah but, [goes through the pictures he pulled off Instagram] here's you dressed as Columbus at a formal dinner, and here's you dressed as Columbus at a football game, and you as Columbus on St. Patrick's Day... "
21,3,Holiday Special,87553,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, you seem to be really stoked on Columbus. "
21,3,Holiday Special,87613,Stan,I don't think you're being intimidating enough. 
21,3,Holiday Special,87616,Stan,"I don't know, like, like uh, maybe say- "
21,3,Holiday Special,87621,Stan,Just give me the phone! Hello! 
21,3,Holiday Special,87623,Stan,Randy Marsh is about to pay for what he's done! [shown on the phone] Protect him and you will pay too! Time is running out! [hangs up] Jesus! 
21,3,Holiday Special,87681,Stan,"Just shut up, and watch what someone posted on their Instagram! "
21,3,Holiday Special,87715,Stan,Who the hell is that? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87739,Stan,We definitely don't have anyone with superhuman speed in our franchise. 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87747,Stan,"Whoawhoa wait, how come we gotta start off with a Netflix series? Can't we just go right into movies? "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87749,Stan,What is it? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87755,Stan,Spreading lies how? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87766,Stan,Butters? Butters! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87768,Stan,"Dude, listen. We don't have time for this. Right now, Netflix is buying any show that people pitch them. We have a real shot at starting our franchise, and you are a part of that franchise plan, okay? We have movies planned for the bad guy. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87770,Stan,Yes! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87819,Stan,"Yeah, nobody believes in us. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87863,Stan,"Aw man, here we go. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87895,Stan,"Dude, this kid is deliberately lying about us on your platform for no other reason than to cause harm! Why are you protecting him?! "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87958,Stan,"Oh yes it is. [Behind Coon and Friends, Butters' parents enter the abandoned store] "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87979,Stan,"No, Wonder Tweek is right. It was better when we started the movies off with the Tupperware prequel. "
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87981,Stan,Why not? 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87986,Stan,You go with the plan! Maybe we'll just... go and do our own franchise! 
21,4,Franchise Prequel,87990,Stan,"Yeah dude, civil war. Fuck you! [leaves the table and the basement] "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88014,Stan,"Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa? "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88016,Stan,It's just some Hummels. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88019,Stan,Grandpa? 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88021,Stan,"[gives Marvin the present] Yeah, I got what you wanted. [Marvin wheels away to his desk, where he opens the present.] "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88023,Stan,That's what the guy gave me. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88025,Stan,"Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit? "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88031,Stan,I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88033,Stan,"I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88035,Stan,"Look, I just gotta make this exchange for him and then we can go. Oh, oh, I think this is her now. [a red fox with blue gloves and mask prances over] "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88037,Stan,Cool. Do you have the Hummel? 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88039,Stan,"'Kay, fine. [makes the exchange, and Swiper shakes the pillow until she's satisfied] "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88042,Stan,"Old people love Hummels, dude. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88047,Stan,"I don't know, all right?! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88049,Stan,It didn't occur to me as a possibility. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88051,Stan,I had no idea what was going on! 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88054,Stan,"No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88056,Stan,"[whispering] Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88058,Stan,"There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88065,Stan,"Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88069,Stan,"What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room? "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88093,Stan,"Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again? "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88095,Stan,"Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88097,Stan,Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88099,Stan,"Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88101,Stan,I don't have guitar lessons. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88103,Stan,[his phone rings and he answers] Hello? 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88105,Stan,"[quickly leaves the table] Dude, I don't have a choice. I have to get the Hummels for my grandpa. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88108,Stan,"All right, all right! I think I know another way. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88113,Stan,Ah! 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88115,Stan,"Uh hey, hey Marcus. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88117,Stan,"Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88119,Stan,"That, that's uh... "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88121,Stan,"That, it's, it's ""Whistling In The Rain."" "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88123,Stan,No. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88125,Stan,"Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88142,Stan,"[runs in] Guys! Guys, I need your help. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88144,Stan,I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88146,Stan,[stands in front of the TV] The head bitch of the nursing home is gonna take my grandpa down. Maybe my whole family. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88148,Stan,But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa! 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88150,Stan,"[catches up] Yeah? What ih, what is it, Cartman. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88152,Stan,"Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88201,Stan,Marcus. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88203,Stan,"Marcus, it's not what you think. I'm trying to make things better here. [he and Marcus begin to walk around each other slowly] "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88205,Stan,"You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people! "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88207,Stan,"It's not for me, Marcus. Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese. [Marcus stops dialing] I know you'd do anything to bring down the people who took him from you. [Marcus begins to soften and soon gets emotional] That's why you have to go further, Marcus. Take it to the people who profited from Chuck E.'s addiction. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88209,Stan,I know. I know. 
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88221,Stan,"[moves to his right] Surprise, Grandpa. [a bag appears where Stan stood just moments ago] I got what you needed. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88223,Stan,"Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right? "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88227,Stan,"What are you doing, Grandpa? "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88241,Stan,"Congratulations on becoming head bitch, Grandpa. "
21,5,Hummels & Heroin,88243,Stan,"Ahhh, don't worry. I have a feeling that's about to happen. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88376,Stan,"No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88378,Stan,We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88381,Stan,"Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything. [from a nearby table, Heidi peeks past Bebe and smiles at Cartman, waving at him] "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88412,Stan,What are bent pits? [Cartman walks in with some plans] 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88414,Stan,You do? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88417,Stan,Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about? 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88472,Stan,"Dude, is your dad home? "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88474,Stan,We can't find our dads either. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88476,Stan,"We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88478,Stan,There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while. 
21,6,Sons A Witches,88484,Stan,"[in Butters' room with Kyle and Kenny] Butter him up, Butters. "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88535,Stan,"Butters, come on! We've gotta go! "
21,6,Sons A Witches,88537,Stan,"I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere! "
21,7,Doubling Down,88600,Stan,"She loves him, I guess. "
21,7,Doubling Down,88634,Stan,"Dude, are you still on this? "
21,7,Doubling Down,88638,Stan,No. 
21,7,Doubling Down,88651,Stan,"Kyle, it's none of our business. "
21,8,Moss Piglets,88956,Stan,[walks into view with Kyle] What's wrong with supporting them? They're our friends. 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89103,Stan,What's going on? 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89146,Stan,Come in! 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89148,Stan,It's just starting. 
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89153,Stan,"[notices Kyle isn't laughing] What, what's wrong, dude. "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89258,Stan,"[calling from his living room] Kyle, what the fuck are you doing? [Everyone present at the viewing party is there again, except Kyle] "
21,9,SUPER HARD PCness,89260,Stan,"Okay, dude. I didn't wanna have to say this, but you're really starting to sound like your mom. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89374,Stan,It's not his imagination. I saw him too. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89376,Stan,"Out by the quarry. But I didn't believe it. I said, ""How could this be..."" "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89379,Stan,"Dude, isn't this all really familiar? I saw something just like this on that show called Stranger... "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89403,Stan,Jesus. Now kids are going missing. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89405,Stan,[notices Kyle across the street walking by] Kyle! [the kids walk up to him] 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89408,Stan,We'll all help you. 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89416,Stan,"Come on you guys. Look, we all know what we're supposed to do now We all saw ""It"" and ""Stranger Things"". We need to get our backpacks and go out to the woods and save the town from evil to some kick-ass '80s' music! "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89447,Stan,"Due, this is '80's' music? "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89449,Stan,"Well, just skip to the next song, man. We're trying to get psyched to destroy evil. We need better '80s' music than that. "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89474,Stan,"Dude, come on! This is not kick-ass '80s' music! "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89477,Stan,"Yeah! Craig just has the wrong stuff. Forget your pandora. I'm doing Spotify. '80s' music. 'Kay. There. [""Pac-Man Fever"" plays] "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89521,Stan,Guys! 
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89540,Stan,"Yeah, we're okay! "
21,10,Splatty Tomato,89565,Stan,"We can't destroy him, can we? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89595,Stan,I flunked that test too. I don't understand fractions - they don't make any sense. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89601,Stan,"Uh, hey, Mom. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89606,Stan,"[glances up at Randy, who is cutting a slice away from his steak.] Um... Oh- Oh, I... flunked my math quiz. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89609,Stan,"[looks at Randy] Oh, the school shooting? "
22,1,Dead Kids,89611,Stan,"Oh, yeah, some kid shot up the school. "
22,1,Dead Kids,89613,Stan,No. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89615,Stan,No. 
22,1,Dead Kids,89620,Stan,What's up Mom's ass? 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89824,Stan,[trailing behind] Do I have to go? It's the only day I get to play games. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89827,Stan,[upset] ...Don't understand why we have to go to church every Sunday. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89857,Stan,I really don't understand the point of all that. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89859,Stan,But back then I don't know if church was that stupid. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89869,Stan,"How many cards do you start with, Kenny? "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89874,Stan,"Okay, so I-I guess I'm gonna go to the saloon and try to arrest Cartman. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89889,Stan,"I didn't invite him. [Cartman looks at Kenny, who just looks back] "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89966,Stan,"[comes down the stairs and approaches the crew] Uh, excuse me. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89968,Stan,What are you doing? 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89970,Stan,"Well, I mean, it looks like you're scrubbing and bleaching our tables and chairs. "
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89972,Stan,Yeah he was. I played with him. 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,89974,Stan,What's a Kumby? 
22,2,A Boy And A Priest,90029,Stan,I have no idea what's going on. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90141,Stan,"Dude, Kyle! Dude! "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90144,Stan,Did you read what Mr. Hankey tweeted last night?! 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90146,Stan,Yeah. I guess after band rehearsals he went on Twitter to talk about us. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90223,Stan,Nnnope. 
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90226,Stan,"Dude, why do you keep defending him, Kyle? "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90229,Stan,"Mmmm. Once, kind of? "
22,3,The Problem with a Poo,90332,Stan,Where will he go? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90362,Stan,"Yeah, it takes me like an hour to get to school now. It sucks. All because Shelley bribed the playground monitor to let her vape during recess. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90382,Stan,"[takes the vaporizer from Kyle] All right, where'd you guys get these?! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90390,Stan,"Kindergartners said it's some big kid in a trench coat. [notices a kid on a snow drift] Hey look! [a shot of the boy looking towards the parking lot and standing in the sun, so they can't make out who it is] "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90392,Stan,What are you gonna do? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90395,Stan,[surprised] Butters? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90401,Stan,"Butters, do you understand this stuff is an epidemic in our school?! "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90505,Stan,"No, it sucks. I hate this. I wanna go back home. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90507,Stan,I hate you so much. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90509,Stan,No. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90511,Stan,"Pleaes, no. "
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90552,Stan,It's not mine. I took it from a kindergartner. 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90554,Stan,What are you gonna do? 
22,4,Tegridy Farms,90632,Stan,"Oh God, this is just gonna get worse, isn't it? "
22,5,The Scoots,90646,Stan,So anyone can use them? 
22,5,The Scoots,90649,Stan,"Oh yeah, it has one of them little scan thingies. Let me see. [puts up his phone camera to the e-scooter, which scans the code on the e-scooter. A little ding is heard] Yeah, dude, it's downloading the app. "
22,5,The Scoots,90651,Stan,"Aww, it wants a credit card number. "
22,5,The Scoots,90653,Stan,Let's do your mom's 
22,5,The Scoots,90655,Stan,Is that an AmEx? 
22,5,The Scoots,90657,Stan,Espiration? 
22,5,The Scoots,90659,Stan,Security code? 
22,5,The Scoots,90663,Stan,Pretty stupid but sweet. 
22,5,The Scoots,90668,Stan,"[returns and stops] We'd get, like, more candy than anybody. "
22,5,The Scoots,90695,Stan,"Yeah, but that's just it, Kenny. To use a scooter, you have to have a phone and... I mean, if we're waiting for you, we're gonna be as slow as all the other kids. It's... like, you know? "
22,5,The Scoots,90701,Stan,"We're sorry, Kenny. It's just... This awesome plan to get shitloads of candy doesn't... work with... you. [Kenny looks around and reads the mood, then takes his pail and leaves the house] "
22,5,The Scoots,90739,Stan,But we're not gonna tell people 'cause they're gonna copy us. So let's just leave it at that. 
22,5,The Scoots,90745,Stan,What? 
22,5,The Scoots,90826,Stan,"Dude, we can't carry any more candy! "
22,5,The Scoots,90832,Stan,I can't any more. [throws up into his bag] 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90881,Stan,What the fuck?! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90908,Stan,It wasn't a bear! [seen by his locker seated on the floor with his arms around his legs] I saw it. [the other boys walk up to him] 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90910,Stan,"It was at my house. There was a... thing. It attacked my uncle and took his friend. It was like a bear, but a pig... thing. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90912,Stan,"It was at my house, and then here at the school! Everyone says that kid and I looked alike. What if that thing is after me?? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90931,Stan,"Keep looking. There's a lot of people saying they saw it, Kyle. It's not just me. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90933,Stan,"It's not a conspiracy, it's real. Keep going down. There's video. [Kyle scrolls down and stops at ""MAN-BEAR-PIG captured on VIDEO""] There! Right there! [Kyle clicks on it and the video expands. ManBearPig is seen running off with another victim in its jaws.] That's it. That's what I saw. [walks away from the computer] I saw ManBearPig. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90935,Stan,"Don't you remember, dude? We were warned about this. That weirdo guy who came and told us this would happen? He was right. [Kenny and Cartman soon run in] "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90939,Stan,But it wasn't you guys. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90941,Stan,Who was that ex-President guy? The one who showed up and tried to convince everyone of a ManBearPig? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90953,Stan,"Hello, uh, we're looking for a government sort of guy named Al Gore? "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90961,Stan,Mr. Gore? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90963,Stan,Al Gore? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90965,Stan,"I don't know if you remember us, but we're the kids you got to help try and capture ManBearPig? Well uh, eh eh, you were right. Ha, you, you were totally right. ManBearPig is real and, uh, he's killing lots of people in our town. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90971,Stan,"There has to be something we can still do. Please, Mr. Gore. You're the only person who knows anything about it. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90973,Stan,"We, didn't, we didn't realize there were more than- "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,90996,Stan,Yu-you told us to do all this. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91002,Stan,We know how. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91018,Stan,Where did ManBearPig come from? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91025,Stan,Why did the Devil send ManBearPig?! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91046,Stan,He was right before. 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91055,Stan,"All right all right, that's enough! [puts down his candle] You need to stop wasting our time, dude. People are dying! You don't have a fucking clue what you're doing! [the pentagram brightens up, winds whip around in it, flames appear on the bloody markings. The goat is consumed and the flames get stronger.] "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91057,Stan,Oh shit! [facepalm] God damn it! Nothing! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91079,Stan,Making deals? 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91090,Stan,That's gonna be impossible! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91095,Stan,"Everyone, listen! ManBearPig is real! It's a demon that thrives on making deals to exploit mankind's weaknesses. I am super-duper cereal.[a few of the townspeople move in closer behind the officers to listen] We all have to work together, you guys. This one time. We have to all put our pride aside and be willing to say, maybe we were wrong. "
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91100,Stan,No! Nooo! 
22,6,Time To Get Cereal,91102,Stan,Please! Somebody made a deal with ManBearPig! We have to find out who! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91111,Stan,"Officer, you have to let us out of here! We don't have much time! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91113,Stan,"Sir, you have to listen to us. ManBearPig is real. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91118,Stan,[leaves the cell door] Where the hell is Al Gore? Why isn't he coming for us? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91139,Stan,"We broke out of jail, Dad. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91141,Stan,Cartman tricked the guards. We all ran home to be with our parents. Where's mom? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91143,Stan,"Dad, that thing we saw take Ned? It was ManBearPig. It was real! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91145,Stan,"No, Dad. It's... [notices his dad's eyes switching back and forth from him to the TV] Why do you keep looking at the TV? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91147,Stan,"[walks over to get a better look, then steps back, grabs the controller, and looks at Randy] You've been playing Red Dead Redemption?! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91149,Stan,I thought you were working on getting me out! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91151,Stan,You're all the way to St. Denis?! That's like 40 hours of gameplay! How could you uh! Are you high right now?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91153,Stan,Oh my God! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91155,Stan,I can't believe you would get high and play video games while your son is in jail! You're such an asshole! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91157,Stan,[walks up to him] It wasn't me! It was a demon named ManBearPig! [gives him the controller] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91159,Stan,"Yeah, because I learned a lot about-! [stops himself] Whoa whoa, what are you talking about I sound like Grandpa? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91161,Stan,[turns away] Someone made a deal with it... a long time ago. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91201,Stan,[off screen] Grandpa?! [Marvin sits up with his jaw dropped as Stan comes into view a few feet behind him.] What did you do? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91203,Stan,"This isn't the first time ManBearPig has shown up, is it?! What happened?! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91205,Stan,"Cut the shit, Grandpa! You people knew! You made a deal with that thing! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91208,Stan,[follows him down the dorm hallway] Why did you old people make a deal?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91210,Stan,And you just signed away the future?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91212,Stan,What stuff?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91214,Stan,"You couldn't control yourselves, so now that thing is here to kill all of us! Good fuckin' job, Grandpa! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91267,Stan,[puts the frame down and turns to Marvin] You didn't stop to think about what it would mean for us? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91269,Stan,And you didn't give two shits what it would mean for your grandchildren. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91271,Stan,[closes his eyes] Aaaah. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91273,Stan,This is supposed to make me feel better? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91275,Stan,You... people... made a deal with ManBearPig! How?! Where?! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91277,Stan,Tell me how the deal happened so that I can try to make it go away! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91314,Stan,[opens the door and looks in] Guys? Guys! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91316,Stan,"Guys, thank God! Just stay right there, Grandpa! [Marvin sits in his wheelchair in the middle of the school hallway, looking bitter] I know all about the deal. I know what we have to do. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91318,Stan,I figured you guys would be hiding somewhere. This is the first place I thought to look. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91322,Stan,"Guys, listen: my stupid grandpa and a bunch of other old people made the deal with ManBearPig. It's here because of their greediness. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91324,Stan,"Shut up, Grandpa! I know where to go, but I need your help. I'm going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91326,Stan,We have to try. [police sirens are heard approaching] 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91332,Stan,Listen! We know what to do now! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91334,Stan,No! I need to face ManBearPig! 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91337,Stan,Yes I do. We're going to face ManBearPig and put an end to this deal once and for all. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91340,Stan,'Kay. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91342,Stan,"Yes. Yes, we agree to give back cars and ice cream. [ManBearPig grumbles off screen] "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91348,Stan,"[speaking from an open window on the upper floor] Um, he says he'll never come back again, but... we have to give up soy sauce and Red Dead Redemption 2. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91351,Stan,"...Yeah, that's what I thought. [goes back to the table] Um, could we possibly talk about restructuring a new deal? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91353,Stan,"No, no. Just like, um, can we do, like, a renegotiation? "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91355,Stan,Where do I sign that? 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91357,Stan,Okay. 
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91359,Stan,"Shut up, Grandpa! "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91362,Stan,"'Key, got it. "
22,7,Nobody Got Cereal?,91364,Stan,"'Kay, where do I sign that? "
22,8,Buddha Box,91377,Stan,"[Cartman imitates him] ""Hey Cartman! Throw us the ball. You're the goddamn quarterback!"" [Cartman droops] "
22,8,Buddha Box,91442,Stan,I think it's Cartman. 
22,8,Buddha Box,91574,Stan,"Should have just let him be on his phone, dude. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91629,Stan,Think about what? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91633,Stan,"Dude, nobody cares about a stupid bike parade. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91653,Stan,"""Wassup"" is I thought we agreed bike parades are stupid. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91656,Stan,Me too. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91661,Stan,We could totally own the bike parade. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91664,Stan,"[pulls out his phone and starts tapping away] Yeah, and we gotta order some badass spokes and those wheel bumpers! "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91717,Stan,Anything? Did you get anything? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91720,Stan,Maybe if we reorder everything and have it shipped to a different fulfillment center- 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91722,Stan,"No! I refuse to believe we have no other options. Um, what...? What did we do before Amazon? "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91724,Stan,"I mean, before we could get whatever we wanted, where did we get stuff? "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91732,Stan,There's gotta be somebody. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91734,Stan,"Uh, hello? "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91758,Stan,We came because... we need... stuff. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91762,Stan,What?? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91764,Stan,"No! [the worker hisses and goes back into the shadows] No, no, look. We need very specific stuff. There's a big bike parade on Saturday. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91775,Stan,"[turns to face the mall worker] Yeah. Uh, color-coded specific shoes in four specific sizes. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91777,Stan,What? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91782,Stan,H-Hold on a minute. You all stay here 'cause you want to work? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91786,Stan,Wait a minute. You guys... I think I have an idea. 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91811,Stan,"Uh yeah, hi. We ordered a bunch of stuff and we haven't gotten it. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91813,Stan,"No, that's actually why we're calling. We know a whole bunch of people who can come work for you. "
22,9,Unfulfilled,91815,Stan,What fools will pay? 
22,9,Unfulfilled,91817,Stan,"Yeah, but listen: we want our stuff! We ordered a bunch of shit for the bike parade, and if we get you workers, we want them to deliver our stuff first! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91943,Stan,"Dude, we did it. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91948,Stan,You're not gonna do the bike parade? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91951,Stan,Commodity fetishism? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91957,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, don't be a dick! "
22,10,Bike Parade,91960,Stan,"[calmly, quietly] Don't shoot up the school. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91973,Stan,How's it going? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91975,Stan,Our bikes aren't so bad. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91978,Stan,I thought the four of us were unstoppable. 
22,10,Bike Parade,91982,Stan,What? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91984,Stan,How do we get the bike parade cancelled? 
22,10,Bike Parade,91986,Stan,"Hey, yeah. We can go to the Mayor and force her to cancel it. "
22,10,Bike Parade,91990,Stan,Yeah! 
22,10,Bike Parade,92021,Stan,First thing we've gotta do to get the bike parade cancelled is raise awareness. 
22,10,Bike Parade,92035,Stan,"We sure do, Santa! "
22,10,Bike Parade,92044,Stan,"Nononono! Wait wait wait, please! "
22,10,Bike Parade,92061,Stan,"I mean, are we supposed to just keep going? Just go on, making total asses of ourselves? "
22,10,Bike Parade,92064,Stan,"[walks up next to Kyle] Yeah! What? Did we think this was a fucking joke? The bike parade is offensive, and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone! "
22,10,Bike Parade,92067,Stan,"Mayor, we demand you cancel this bike parade! "
22,10,Bike Parade,92070,Stan,It's him. 
22,10,Bike Parade,92076,Stan,[raises his arms] No! 
22,10,Bike Parade,92092,Stan,I guess they are offensive. [Kyle laughs] 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92106,Stan,"Yeah, it's all right here. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92108,Stan,"Yeah, I went through it twice. People aren't ordering as much as last month. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92182,Stan,"[reading from 3x5 index cards] What happened to our country? People are being wronged by a broken system, and we must say ""NO MORE."" No more homegrown marijuana. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92184,Stan,"As the son of a proud American farmer, I am concerned about what homegrown can lead to. People can grow weed wrong and poison themselves. What? "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92186,Stan,"Unscrupulous growers could use cheap irrigation and drown babies. Oh, come on. "
23,1,Mexican Joker,92188,Stan,The fact is simple. Marijuana must be grown with Tegridy. 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92190,Stan,[mimicking Randy] Tegridy. 
23,1,Mexican Joker,92195,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, you're gonna piss off everybody in South Park. "
23,2,Band in China,92368,Stan,"I'm writing a song, Dad. "
23,2,Band in China,92372,Stan,We're gonna move back to our old house? 
23,2,Band in China,92378,Stan,"Aw, come on, Dad! "
23,2,Band in China,92387,Stan,"[nervously] Um, hi. We're Crimson Dawn, and um, this is a song I wrote about living out in the country, on a farm. "
23,2,Band in China,92389,Stan, [growls] Fate is over!  Open your eyes!   
23,2,Band in China,92391,Stan," There is no hope, no second chance!  All the elders saw the fall of the sky!  Pride and glory!  To touch the sky, we've burned the earth!  Built our own infirmity!   "
23,2,Band in China,92412,Stan,You wanna sign us so we can make a record and I can move away from here? 
23,2,Band in China,92414,Stan,Biopic? You want to make the Crimson Dawn Biopic? 
23,2,Band in China,92429,Stan,"Uuummm, it was about two weeks ago. "
23,2,Band in China,92431,Stan,"I hah, I hah, I hadn't seen my friend Kyle, and I hate living on a farm, so I started writing songs. "
23,2,Band in China,92437,Stan,Oh. And then Kenny learned to play bass watching YouTube videos of John Lennon with the Dalai Lama. 
23,2,Band in China,92441,Stan,"[somewhat upset] Aw, seriously? "
23,2,Band in China,92445,Stan,"Oh, come on. That's ridiculous! "
23,2,Band in China,92447,Stan,[a bit defeated] Yeah. 
23,2,Band in China,92465,Stan,"This is so awesome, you guys. Our band is gonna be huge. "
23,2,Band in China,92469,Stan,"Hey. What's wrong, Jimmy? "
23,2,Band in China,92472,Stan,"Yeah, we can get you a liver transplant. "
23,2,Band in China,92474,Stan,How come? 
23,2,Band in China,92476,Stan,No homosexuality?! We're trying to do a band biopic! 
23,2,Band in China,92494,Stan,Yeah. what's wrong with that? 
23,2,Band in China,92496,Stan,"Yeah, because I hate living on a farm 30 miles out of town! "
23,2,Band in China,92498,Stan,"I can't stand my dad anymore, and if I want to do death metal, I can! It's a free country! "
23,2,Band in China,92500,Stan,"Aw, come on! "
23,2,Band in China,92502,Stan,But that will take forever! 
23,2,Band in China,92513,Stan,"Now I know how all the writers in Hollywood feel. [the censor laughs, then complains.] "
23,2,Band in China,92526,Stan,"I can't do it anymore, you guys. I can't even think with the Chinese government censoring everything I write. "
23,2,Band in China,92528,Stan,"It's so wrong. You know, I mean, we live in a time when the only movies us American kids go see are ones that are approved by China. "
23,2,Band in China,92531,Stan,We just gotta face it. A death metal band is never gonna make real money anymore. The only band that would get approved by China would be all vanilla and cheesy. [gets emotional] I'm gonna have to live on that fucking farm forever. [lowers his head and sobs quietly. Butters comforts him. The ICE bus pulls up and drops off Kyle and Cartman.] 
23,2,Band in China,92532,Stan,"[looks up] Kyle! Dude, you're back! [rushed up to meet him. The other boys follow.] "
23,2,Band in China,92535,Stan,"Not really. We just almost had a biopic made for our band, but ...wait a minute... [his eyes dart around as he thinks] Wait, vanilla and cheesy! I've got it. I've got it! "
23,2,Band in China,92538,Stan,"Cut. Cut, cut! [the special effects disappear and the green screen in the gym is shown] This is all wrong. "
23,2,Band in China,92540,Stan,"Yeah, but I can't sell my soul like this. I want to get away from that farm, more than anything, but it's not worth living in a world where China controls my country's art. [one of the censor's protests] I don't care how many people you have! I've got something in me that just won't let me be a part of all this. "
23,2,Band in China,92543,Stan,"I wanna be proud of who we are, guys! And anybody who would betray their ideals just to make money in China isn't worth a lick of spit! "
23,2,Band in China,92548,Stan,"[notices his dad's appearance] Dad, why are you covered in honey and blood? [Randy just looks over his appearance] Dad? Did you kill Winnie the Pooh? "
23,2,Band in China,92550,Stan,I'm going to go write another song about you. 
23,3,Shots,92602,Stan,You got your shots? 
23,3,Shots,92606,Stan,"Dude, Cartman, don't you know that if you don't get immunized, you actually put people at risk who- "
23,3,Shots,92608,Stan,"I'm saying that we all had to get shots, and actually, if just one person doesn't- [Cartman sneezes and gets mucus all over his hands.] "
23,3,Shots,92652,Stan,I hate marijuana too! [follows them out] 
23,4,Let Them Eat Goo,92758,Stan,"[after several seconds] I don't know... Do like a sale. Like, a Fall sale? "
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,92992,Stan,For Halloween? I guess so. 
23,5,Tegridy Farms Halloween Special,93116,Stan,"Well, it is a little crazy how much you talk about the mummy. "
23,6,Season Finale,93254,Stan,"Like, how long is ""a long time""? Could it be years? "
23,6,Season Finale,93256,Stan,YES! 
23,6,Season Finale,93260,Stan,"But if he doesn't get out of it, then what happens to us? "
23,6,Season Finale,93262,Stan,"We will, Mom. You too. "
23,7,Board Girls,93447,Stan,How much damage is that? 
23,7,Board Girls,93499,Stan,I think Nichole and Tammy are cool to play with. 
23,7,Board Girls,93501,Stan,You mean like Nemo's War? Nemo's War is sweet. 
23,7,Board Girls,93505,Stan,"Well if you want something hard, then you need a really crunchy Euro game, something like a Vital Lacerda's Escape Plan or a Uwe Rosenburg Euro. "
23,7,Board Girls,93507,Stan,Well all Euros are pretty mathy. 
23,7,Board Girls,93509,Stan,"So then you want a war miniatures game. Something skirmish-style, like Legion or Blood and Plunder. "
23,7,Board Girls,93541,Stan,"Whoa, you painted your miniatures? "
23,7,Board Girls,93543,Stan,Where'd you learn to do that? 
23,7,Board Girls,93545,Stan,I love BGG. 
23,7,Board Girls,93601,Stan,Wow! 
23,7,Board Girls,93607,Stan,What? Who says? 
23,7,Board Girls,93609,Stan,"Well, who made up that stupid rule? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93716,Stan,"Dude, Kyle, why are you talking about all this? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93723,Stan,"Yeah, he wants it. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93735,Stan,"Dude, you realize we won't get that game 'till Christmas. We could be playing it tomorrow. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93739,Stan,She's in. Kyle's mom just squatted in the toilet. [gets off his perch and walks over to Cartman] 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93745,Stan,You think she'll poop a big enough log? [Kyle appears on the steps behind them.] 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93794,Stan,How can answer that to which we have no knowledge? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93799,Stan,You want us to steal some of Kyle's mom's poop for you? 
23,8,Turd Burglars,93815,Stan,"Yes, we do understand. We just... well, since you're his publicist. we thought that... you could give Mr. Brady our message. [begins crying] "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93818,Stan,"Well if Mr. Brady could just, you know, have Kenny stay over at his house for a night. "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93848,Stan,"[thinking, ""People just keep looking at me like I'm supposed to say something.""] "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93863,Stan,"So, you're all here to meet Tom Brady too? "
23,8,Turd Burglars,93874,Stan,"Kyle, dude, what are you doing here? [Kyle moves forward] "
23,9,Basic Cable,93914,Stan,About what? 
23,9,Basic Cable,94071,Stan,PC Babies? What the hell is this? [The four are at Jimmy's house with Clyde]  
23,9,Basic Cable,94085,Stan,What do you mean? This isn't just happening here? 
23,9,Basic Cable,94089,Stan,Let's just hurry and get to Tolkien's house! 
23,9,Basic Cable,94109,Stan,"Uh, my name's Stan Marsh. [Kyle and Kenny introduce themselves] "
23,9,Basic Cable,94112,Stan,"Well, it looks like nobody's streaming shows tonight. Sorry, Sophie. "
23,9,Basic Cable,94116,Stan,Scott? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94382,Stan,"I'm, I'm here. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94411,Stan,It's not school! It's a freakin' joke. We're not even learning anything. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94413,Stan,"No, I'm fine, Mom! You know, I'm strong. I'm just worried about how this is all affecting weaker kids like, you know, like Butters. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94419,Stan,"Yeah, Uncle Jimbo. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94428,Stan,"Wow, that's great! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94451,Stan,"If they're letting us go back to school, then soon we can get back to everything! I mean, doesn't this mean things are finally going back to normal? Dad? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94513,Stan,Oh cool! Turn it up! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94516,Stan,They think they're about to find the vaccine. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94529,Stan,"What's a pangolin, Mom? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94531,Stan,"Do you know what a pangolin is, Dad? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94577,Stan,"Uh, we were there, and Token was actually taken to the hospital because you guys shot him. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94580,Stan,That doesn't make any sense! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94615,Stan,"[notices the officers moving towards Butters] Butters, Butters, you gotta calm down. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94631,Stan,"Kyle, I need to talk to you. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94633,Stan,I'm really worried. About Butters. I think he's sick. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94635,Stan,"No! It's all the other stuff. The isolation and the uncertainty. [put his hands in his jacket pockets and wanders off] I'm just really worried what all the stuff around COVID is doing to some kids. You know, not every kid is like us. There's some kids who really can't take it anymore. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94637,Stan,[getting emotional] And what if he's not? What if Butters is actually starting to lose his mind? What if he feels his body shutting down right now? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94639,Stan,It's time for us to ask for help. From someone who has more authority at this school than these cops. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94647,Stan,"Uh, hi, it's Stan Marsh. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94649,Stan,"I'm sorry. We had to get your attention. Listen, we're being kept at the school, and one of the students here is really sick. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94651,Stan,"Nono, Mr. President, please! You gotta come back to South Park. Our teachers are shooting people. Everyone's arguing and, and there's a facility outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine! You might be able to stop the pandemic. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94653,Stan,...Huh? 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94655,Stan,But the pandemic isn't just killing Mexicans. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94657,Stan,You're just gonna sit there and not do anything?! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94659,Stan,God dammit! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94702,Stan,Butters. Butters! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94704,Stan,Don't worry. I'm going to save you! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94706,Stan,"Guys, guys! [claps. The kids begin to stir] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94708,Stan,"Shhh. You guys, we have to get Butters out of here. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94710,Stan,No! We have to get him out of here! Now! We need to take him... to Build-A-Bear. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94712,Stan,He has to go out and do something normal! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94714,Stan,"We can't wait around and wait for people to figure things out, okay?! It's not gonna happen! They just keep taking everything from him and saying it's for his own good! But who's to say he can't go out and have a little goddamn fun?! If we want things to go back to normal, then we just gotta go do it! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94716,Stan,"They're just gonna be making more restrictions, and more rules, and who's gonna fight to go back to the way things were? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94718,Stan,"We can make things normal for Butters again, and make school the way it was! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94720,Stan,"Wait, what? No, in a class, with real teachers! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94722,Stan,"I'm talking about normal, like back in March. What normal are you talking about? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94724,Stan,Look it doesn't matter. We just gotta break the fuck out of here. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94750,Stan,"Okay, all clear! Come on! Go go go! [Butters is lying down in a small wagon, the other three wheel him down the sidewalk] All right, you ready to have some fun, Butters? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94753,Stan,"Shit shit, get back, back, back, back, back! [they hide in Parking Lot A. Death rides by and they come back out] Okay, all good. Come on. [They reach a plaza] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94755,Stan,"Butters, Butters. [wakes Butters up] Look! [Butters looks up and sees Build-A-Bear Workshop] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94757,Stan,"Yeah, it's real. Come on! We got an appointment! [helps Butters out of the wagon. They reach the entrance, only to see James the shopkeeper closing the shop.] Oh, uh hey, excuse me. We had an appointment. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94759,Stan,But I called. Y-you said you were open today for appointments. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94762,Stan,"Ple-hease, my friend has to build a bear. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94764,Stan,"Ohoh, just give us one minute! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94767,Stan,We can't go. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94769,Stan,We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to break in. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94771,Stan,And then build him a bear. 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94773,Stan,"If we have to, yes! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94775,Stan,I don't care! I'm not following the rules anymore! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94785,Stan,"Here we are, Butters! Look! You made it! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94787,Stan,"No, it's not a dream! We are really here, and we are going to build you a bear! Which one you want? You want the panda? You want the Bronco koala? "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94789,Stan,"Caballero Grizzly. [gets the materials needed] Okay, we just find the sh-shell and the uh, the outfit. "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94791,Stan,"It's gonna fucking work! Just fucking shut up! [take the shell to a stuffer] Okay! Okay, Butters. Look! [starts the machine] We're gonna put the stuffing in! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94793,Stan,"Okay, uh, um... [starts pressing buttons. All of a sudden, the shell is pumped full of cotton and explodes] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94795,Stan,It's okay! We can start over! We can start over! There'a do-over machine right over there! Look! [walks over to a shredder and drops the mangled bear in. The shredder has a window through which the bear is seen being destroyed.] 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94805,Stan,"God dammit! [looks out the window and sees Death there. Stan tries one more time to fill the shell, but the gust of air knocks him to the ground. Stan gets right back up to try again] "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94807,Stan,"No, Kyle, we can't let Butters down! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94811,Stan,No! I'm not giving up! 
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94822,Stan,"Cartman, no! [follows Cartman inside with Kyle. Cartman prepares to drop the pangolin into the store's shredder] Don't do it, Cartman! That thing is our only chance! "
24,1,The Pandemic Special,94824,Stan,"You guys were right, okay? This hasn't been about Butters. I've been acting like this because I can't take these shutdowns anymore, and I'm scared what it's doing to me! I'm looking for whom to blame. Saying I'm trying to help people to make myself feel better because the truth is... I just wanna have fun again. [Cartman looks at him] I wanted to see that I could go out in the world and do things that I used to do, but I can't. I'm not any better, and I don't care any more than anyone else. And I did all this [tears well up in his eyes] because I just want my life back! I just want my life back... [begins to weep silently. Cartman's look softens. He looks at the shredder, at the boys, then steps down from the shredder, carries the pangolin out of the store, and gives it to the Chief Scientist] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94860,Stan,"Recess is almost over, dude. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94884,Stan,"Yeah, we finally get back to school and have some sense of normalcy and you guys make the teacher walk out! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94891,Stan,[turns to the boys] Do you guys know how hard it's going to be for them to find us a replacement teacher? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94930,Stan,"Okay, grandpa. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94951,Stan,"I don't even know what to do! If you ask me, this whole pandemic has been a giant waste of time! [leaves] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94984,Stan,Yes. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,94990,Stan,"Please, Mr. Mackey, we just want to get our old teacher back for everybody, okay? Can you just tell her we're really, really sorry? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95004,Stan,"Hello, sir! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95007,Stan,"Yeah, we assist senior citizens who need the vaccine, but then need help getting to the right place. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95011,Stan,"Holy shit, dude. That was pretty easy! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95019,Stan,"Just pay her, Cartman. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95021,Stan,"Come on, the pharmacist is coming! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95029,Stan,"Oh, great, Kyle. Now he knows there's a plan! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95033,Stan,"Kenny, grab the vaccines! [kicks the pharmacist in the leg, while Kenny grabs the tray of vaccines and they run out of the building] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95035,Stan,"Go, go, go, go!! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95092,Stan,[angry] What the hell did I do?! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95126,Stan,[walking up to Kyle] I don't see anybody. I think we're safe here until school starts in the morning. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95130,Stan,[turns to look at Cartman] What? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95141,Stan,"I say we take the vaccines ourselves. I mean, why are us kids last? This whole pandemic has been about doing what's best for adults. Maybe for the broship we do what's best for us. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95179,Stan,"Kyle? [Kyle, startled, drops the can of Cactus Cooler and tries to hide the vaccine] What are you doing? "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95181,Stan,[walking towards Kyle] So then why are you replacing some of the vaccines with Cactus Cooler? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95183,Stan,[angry] I don't want my mom to die either! I can't believe that you would lie to me. That you would hide shit from me. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95186,Stan,"[still looking angry] Yeah, we're gonna go to the school now, buddy. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95188,Stan,[walking towards Kyle] I'm just gonna try and pretend this didn't happen. But only because it's what's best for Kenny. [he turns and walks away] 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95191,Stan,I just want this over with. Let's get these stupid things to the teachers and go home. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95196,Stan,"We don't have time for this, Scott. [the boys walk towards Scott Malkinson] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95222,Stan,[grab the vaccines] We got to get outta here! 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95249,Stan,"[glares at Kyle] And what about you, Kyle? You were the one trying to take vaccines for yourself this morning! "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95252,Stan,"Look, let's just face it, you guys. We don't trust each other and we don't like each other. We can't keep pretending. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95258,Stan,"Look, it's been a hard year. And I think for some people there's just no going back. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95260,Stan,"We can't just force things for Kenny's sake. It's not good for us and it's not good for him. [he turns around, taking his hands out of his pockets and resting against the wall] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95291,Stan,Yup. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95296,Stan,A week is a long time for Kenny to be with one person. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95300,Stan,It would be easier if I just knew I always had Kenny on certain days. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95307,Stan,"Well, I say that out of all of those... the first one makes the most sense. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95309,Stan,[he gets out of his chair] 2-2-3. That's so ridiculous... that it just might work. 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95319,Stan,"[walking up to Kyle on the left] Dude, what are you doing? You're gonna get yourself killed. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95323,Stan,"Okay, let's do this. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95326,Stan,What the fuck is that? 
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95342,Stan,"Hello, Mrs. Nelson! [she is walking down the stairs] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95355,Stan,"Well, I guess this is it... [turns around to face rest of the boys] "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95359,Stan,"Everything's gonna be okay, Kenny. I'll see you on Monday. "
24,2,South ParQ Vaccination Special,95362,Stan,"Hey, I wish you guys all the best, huh? "
25,1,Pajama Day,95387,Stan,"After everything we've been through the past couple years, they're gonna take pajama day from us, too. "
25,1,Pajama Day,95393,Stan,"What else can we do, brah? "
25,1,Pajama Day,95484,Stan,We can do this!  
25,2,The Big Fix,95586,Stan,There's only one black kid in my whole class. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95588,Stan,I do hang out with him! 
25,2,The Big Fix,95590,Stan,I... I don't know. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95594,Stan,"Uh, hey, Token. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95596,Stan,"Uh, listen, I uh... How you doin'? "
25,2,The Big Fix,95598,Stan,Um... You think your family would wanna come over for dinner? Out at our farm? 
25,2,The Big Fix,95600,Stan,"Yeah but... Look, Token, I think maybe you and I should hang out more. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95602,Stan,"I mean, we never just hang out, you and me. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95604,Stan,"Shut up, Butters. Look, just will you please just see if your family will come over for dinner? It would mean a lot. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95622,Stan,"[to Tolkien] I thought your name was ""Token"". "
25,2,The Big Fix,95639,Stan,"Dude... my head is reeling, you're not gonna believe this. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95641,Stan,Token's name isn't Token. It's Tolkien. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95643,Stan,"No, no, no, no. He's named after the guy who wrote The Hobbit and stuff! "
25,2,The Big Fix,95645,Stan,[horrified] You knew it was Tolkien like the writer. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95647,Stan,"No, no, no! No, no, no, no! I distinctly remember Cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it T-O-K-E-N. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95649,Stan,Wha– hold on a second! [he calls Cartman] 
25,2,The Big Fix,95652,Stan,"Dude, Cartman, did you know that Tolkien is named after J.R.R. Tolkien? "
25,2,The Big Fix,95654,Stan,"Then why did you spell it ""Token"" without the ""L"" or the ""I""?! "
25,2,The Big Fix,95657,Stan,"Uh, yeah, hang on a second Tolk-kien, just taking a shit. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95659,Stan,Oh my God... I suck... 
25,2,The Big Fix,95680,Stan,"[returning the fist bump] Okay, I guess... "
25,2,The Big Fix,95682,Stan,I kinda wanted to talk about something in private. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95684,Stan,I think... I might be horribly racist.[pause] 
25,2,The Big Fix,95686,Stan,"So... there's this kid at my school, and... he's black. And his parents named him after the guy that wrote Lord of the Rings. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95688,Stan,"Yeah... well, I-I thought his name was Token. Like– like a black kid that's just there so that... like... there's a black kid. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95690,Stan,The whole time! I've thought that the whole time! 
25,2,The Big Fix,95692,Stan,Huh? 
25,2,The Big Fix,95694,Stan,"No, I was just try– "
25,2,The Big Fix,95696,Stan,I'm sorry! 
25,2,The Big Fix,95698,Stan,Doctor? 
25,2,The Big Fix,95700,Stan,"Doctor, please, I don't want to be like this! I'll do anything, just tell me what to do! "
25,2,The Big Fix,95702,Stan,"Okay, what should I read? "
25,2,The Big Fix,95716,Stan,"Guys... lately I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I've had to ask myself hard questions, because for a long time now, I've misinterpreted some amazing writing. I've done a lot of reading... And I've learned why Sauron built the black gate of Mordor across the path of Cirith Grogor, which led into the enclosed plain of Udun. I've learned that the Mouth of Sauron was once a man, who commanded the armies of Gorgoroth and dismissed Aragorn's claim as King. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95718,Stan,"I firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books. Because if we don't fully know about Tolkien, then we can make some terrible, offensive mistakes. In fact... did you guys know that our friend Tolkien, who goes to school here, is named after J.R.R. Tolkien? "
25,2,The Big Fix,95722,Stan,"[glares] My point is, we need to petition the school to make Tolkien required reading. To better understand our classmate. I think maybe we all haven't done enough to make sure than Tolkien doesn't feel isolated and left out. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95724,Stan,"Not yet, Token. Just another couple minutes. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95726,Stan,"[pause] Just a couple minutes, bro. [Tolkien leaves, closing the door] "
25,2,The Big Fix,95746,Stan,"Sup, guys. You know, I've done a lot of reading lately. And I'd like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today J.R.R. Tolkien appreciation day! [the crowd is silent] These books go so much deeper than the Hollywood movies. And we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture. In fact, how many of you knew that our classmate Tolkien was named after J.R.R. Tolkien? [every audience member raises their hand] But you don't know that Lord of the Rings was an analogy for World War II, did you?! And I'll bet you didn't know that there was originally 19 Rings of Power that were forged by Celebrimbor! So there's much we need to understand. And so I would like to bring up the man himself. Come on up here, Tolkien! Come on! "
25,2,The Big Fix,95750,Stan,"Nope. Not any better, Mom. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95752,Stan,"Tolkien is... here? [he walks downstairs into the living room] Hey, Tol-kien. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95754,Stan,What are you doing here? 
25,2,The Big Fix,95756,Stan,"Yeah, I'm good. I'm... No, I'm not... Tolkien, I have something I have to tell you. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95758,Stan,"This whole time, I thought your name was ""Token"". Like... the token black person. "
25,2,The Big Fix,95760,Stan,Yeah. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95762,Stan,I don't know. So I understand if you don't wanna be around me anymore. 
25,2,The Big Fix,95764,Stan,What?! 
25,2,The Big Fix,95766,Stan,"Oh, my God, this is great! [he grabs Tolkien's hands and takes him into the kitchen] Mom, Dad, guess what?! Tolkien's family bought the farm across the street! We're neighbors! "
25,2,The Big Fix,95783,Stan,Dad! 
25,2,The Big Fix,95789,Stan,But Dad– 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96301,Stan,"Yeah, I got some right here, partner! [he gets out an air tank and hands it to his partner] "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96313,Stan,"Dude, I can't believe we tied! That was epic. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96317,Stan,And you know what else is cool? We all have teenagers now! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96320,Stan,"Hell yeah, dude! We just gotta keep our teenagers happy and we can play Airsoft all the time! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96347,Stan,Hello? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96349,Stan,[pause] Excuse me? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96351,Stan,"Oh, is this my teenager? How's it going, dude? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96353,Stan,"Well, you have to put the noodles in boiling water. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96355,Stan,You… Do you have a sink? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96357,Stan,"Bruh, what? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96359,Stan,"Hey, man, it's cool! Lemme, uh– lemme slow it down for ya. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96377,Stan,"Dude, that's my friend Kenny, we gotta kill him! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96379,Stan,"Okay, okay, but if we kill Kenny we get a point, right? Come on! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96384,Stan,"It's okay, it's fine. We're sorry. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96386,Stan,"Dude, it's ok, it's just a gay rule. Come on, let's beat these guys! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96389,Stan,"[he takes his phone out and dials] Dude, Kyle, where are you? We started playing like 20 minutes ago. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96392,Stan,"Hair gel?! What the fuck, dude, we're getting killed out here! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96417,Stan,"Oh, my God, you gotta be shitting me. [Stan answers the phone] Yeah—hello? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96420,Stan,Whuh—what? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96422,Stan,I-I didn't call you gay. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96424,Stan,I was saying the rule was gay. I wasn't talking anything about sexual orientation. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96426,Stan,"You're right, I shouldn't have used that word! Look—I was one of the first people ever to say there was nothing wrong with being gay. I had a dog that was gay! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96428,Stan,"Okay, dude… what… do you want me to do? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96430,Stan,"Okay, but you called me… hello? Hello? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96432,Stan,What are you doing? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96434,Stan,"Okay, don't hold your hand over a lighter. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96436,Stan,Jesus fucking Christ. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96438,Stan,"Yeah, that was kinda stupid. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96441,Stan,"I seriously don't know what to do… I've tried being nice, I've tried being harsh… and I get nothing from my teenager. Nothing. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96444,Stan,I'd love him to threaten to do anything. I'd love him to do. Anything. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96449,Stan,"No, we can't give up on Airsoft—I'm like four hundred dollars into this hobby. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96451,Stan,Except for the part about being around teenagers. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96453,Stan,What do you mean? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96455,Stan,Wow. 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96463,Stan,"Alright, guys! We got the tents all set up. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96467,Stan,"So, what do you guys wanna do? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96469,Stan,"'Kay, yeah, we can do that later, but first maybe, um… let's bond a bit… "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96499,Stan,We… have completely had it up to here with you! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96501,Stan,Our friend Kyle just wanted to play Airsoft. And now he's quit because of your attitudes. What do you have to say for yourselves? 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96503,Stan,"Yeah, bruh. Great, thank you. [Stan turns around pissed] I can't… I can't… "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96508,Stan,And we don't want you here! We just wanna fucking play Airsoft without any of you on our team! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96510,Stan,"That sounds totally fine! Us against you, let's fucking go! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96512,Stan,"Fine, and you too when we beat all of you! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96515,Stan,"[Gerald, Randy and Stuart walk into the place] Dad? "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96536,Stan,They're not coming out of cover! I don't see them! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96545,Stan,Yeah! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96547,Stan,That was so epic! 
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96549,Stan,"That was so sweet, you guys! I bet the teenagers will never go back to that place again! "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96552,Stan,"Yeah, thanks, Dad. "
25,5,"Help, My Teenager Hates Me!",96557,Stan,"Ok, let's go! "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96563,Stan,You told me to finish my homework! 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96568,Stan,I know. I'm wearing green. [he shows a green T-shirt under his jacket] 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96685,Stan,[his phone rings and he answers] Hello? 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96687,Stan,"Dad, it's me. You called the wrong person. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96689,Stan,I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96691,Stan,Stop who? 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96693,Stan,"Yeah, Tol-l-l-kien is sitting right here. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96695,Stan,I don't care. 
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96697,Stan,"Okay, what do you want me to do? "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96699,Stan,"Dad, it's St. Patrick's Day. We're gonna do a scavenger hunt at recess. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96713,Stan,"Hey, there, we brought you a cake. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96715,Stan,"[he pinches his nose, frustrated] God dammit. You... You should just enjoy the cake. "
25,6,Credigree Weed St. Patrick's Day Special,96721,Stan,"Well, see ya. [the boys leave and Randy takes a jar of his special from inside the cake] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96816,Stan,"Hey, what's up? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96818,Stan,You guys made another TikTok? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96834,Stan,"Yeah, they're quite the little team, aren't they? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96836,Stan,"I, uh... I'm gonna go inside, guys. I'm gonna get some homework done. [He walks away.] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96859,Stan,What? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96861,Stan,I don't care that Kyle is making TikToks with Tolkien. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,96865,Stan,"Oh! Hey, Kyle. "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96868,Stan,"Well, dude, do you wanna sit down? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96870,Stan,"[dissapointedly] Oh, yeah, sure... "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96875,Stan,"Well... um, I'm gonna head back to class, guys. [He takes his food tray and leaves the table, looking down sadly.] "
26,1,Cupid Ye,96971,Stan,Stop talking to me. [he leaves] 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97052,Stan,Yeah? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97054,Stan,What?! 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97056,Stan,Reason with who? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97058,Stan,What did you do? 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97060,Stan,"Dude, Cartman, are you okay? Do you need to, like, talk to somebody? "
26,1,Cupid Ye,97062,Stan,[Shrugs.] Yeah. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97064,Stan,[Shrugs.] I guess so. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97083,Stan,[At the entrance of the school.] Tolkien! Tolkien I need to talk to you. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97085,Stan,Tolkien…  I owe you an apology. Someone has been messing with you… and it was all for me. 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97087,Stan,I’ve been jealous about you and Kyle’s TikToks. [Glass shatters. Stan and Tolkien jump. Students scream as Cupid Ye fires arrows to them in the hallways.] 
26,1,Cupid Ye,97102,Stan,"It’s not his fault, it’s mine. I was jealous of you guys and your TikToks. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97159,Stan,"Kyle, dude, where were you last night? "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97164,Stan,"Well, yeah, we're all like level 12 now. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97169,Stan,"Yeah, it's got a lot better range now. What about you? [The school bell rings] "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97252,Stan,"It's okay, dude, we had a great time. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97255,Stan,"...'Kay, well, we gotta get to class.[They all start leaving] "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97284,Stan,You say it. 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97286,Stan,"Look, Kyle... We just kinda don't care about some dumb prince and his stupid wife. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97290,Stan,"Dude, we're just kind of sick of hearing about them. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97322,Stan,[unamused] Good. How are you? 
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97326,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure we can figure that out. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97386,Stan,"Hey, dude. Uh... We thought maybe you could do with a little outside time. "
26,2,The Worldwide Privacy Tour,97392,Stan,"Sure, you can play. "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97397,Stan,"Yeah, can I do it? "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97411,Stan,[from the living room] Ew! 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97451,Stan,"You're playing ""Hogwarts Legacy"" on a PS5. "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97477,Stan,I wanna try it. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97487,Stan,About what? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97490,Stan,What the fuck? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97492,Stan,Of what? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97494,Stan,"Dude, I haven't even said anything! "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97496,Stan,What?! 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97521,Stan,"Dad, can I talk to you?! "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97523,Stan,I need to talk to you right now! 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97525,Stan,The fuck are you doing?! 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97527,Stan,You need to stop gloating to everybody! 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97529,Stan,"Yes, you are, and now kids at school are calling me Richie Rich! "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97531,Stan,Nobody cares about your stupid toilet and you're acting like a jerk. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97533,Stan,"How are you trying to help people, Dad? "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97535,Stan,You are not like JFK! You're just showing off! 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97577,Stan,What? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97579,Stan,What's a plungercost? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97582,Stan,I'm not bragging about my toilet! And why is it such a big deal anyway? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97586,Stan,70% of the world doesn't use toilet paper? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97591,Stan,"So, then, why do Americans use it so much? "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97593,Stan,"Well, then, maybe somebody -- "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97607,Stan,Is he gonna be okay? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97615,Stan,"Dad, I'm sorry I yelled at you before. I didn't know you were really trying to help. "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97618,Stan,I let Dad down once. Somebody has to pick up where he left off. [he walks out] 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97621,Stan,"There's something more going on here. I think my dad was on to something and I didn't listen to him, and now he's in a hospital. "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97640,Stan,Who will? 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97646,Stan,Second grade kid two years ago... Wrote about toilets in the school news paper. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97648,Stan,You weren't warning me about people getting upset. You know more about this. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97650,Stan,Hey! [he catches up to Jimmy] You wrote a story in the school paper and someone came after you. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97652,Stan,"Jimmy, I want to know who shot my dad! "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97654,Stan,You're talking about the toilet paper companies. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97660,Stan,I can't believe they shot my dad... because he wanted to change things. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97662,Stan,"You might be too scared Jimmy, but I'm a Marsh. [he leaves] "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97664,Stan,"My fellow Americans, we have been coerced and brain washed. While the rest of the world walks around with cleaner buttholes, we are obsessed with dry paper sold to us by billion-dollar corporations. "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97667,Stan,My father wanted everyone to see that there were alternatives. But they don't want him talking about alternatives. 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97669,Stan,"And we can't be blindly buying their products anymore. And as a town, we will find alternatives, and we will not be afraid to -- [Randy walks up to the podium, interrupting Stan mid-sentence] "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97671,Stan,Dad! 
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97673,Stan,"No, dad, it's the toilet paper companies that are behind all the -- "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97675,Stan,"Dad, we can't just back down. "
26,3,Japanese Toilet,97679,Stan,What about helping people and leading by example? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97713,Stan,"Hey, Clyde, can I talk to you? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97715,Stan,"Well, um, Wendy just came up to me and was acting all hurt 'cause she thinks I don't care about her. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97718,Stan,"Well, she says that she wishes I would reply to her texts the way that Clyde responds to Bebe so, like, how do you do it? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97721,Stan,Chat GPT? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97730,Stan,This is a real app? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97733,Stan,Hello? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97735,Stan,Didn't get what? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97737,Stan,"Oh, yeah, I- I wrote it. I'll send it to you right now. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97745,Stan,Uh-huh. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97757,Stan,You tell me what's going on! 
26,4,Deep Learning,97759,Stan,"You guys are using it to write essays, too! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97771,Stan,"You guys, I'm not going to tell anyone else! You really think I want Wendy finding out about this thing? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97809,Stan,"Yeah, it's really good. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97811,Stan,For what? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97813,Stan,"Oh, that's cool. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97815,Stan,Yeah. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97817,Stan,Yeah. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97819,Stan,Yep. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97821,Stan,The boating accident in Switzerland... was tough. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97823,Stan,It was great... and very tough. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97825,Stan,"Oh, shit. What time is it? "
26,4,Deep Learning,97827,Stan,"Oh, shit. My mom told me to be home right at a little after four. Sorry, Wendy. I- I gotta get going. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97829,Stan,"Okay, cool. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97833,Stan,Shit. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97864,Stan,"That's not what's important. If they find out I've been using OpenAI for class, Wendy's gonna know I've been using it with her, and It's gonna crush her! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97869,Stan,"Look, maybe...Maybe this AI-detection technology won't work. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97898,Stan,Mr. Garrison can I talk to you? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97900,Stan,Yes it is important. You know when you done something wrong sometimes the best thing to do is to come out and admit it. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97902,Stan,Clyde told me about it. I came to you because if they find out something me and you punish me it’s going to really hurt Wendy. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97904,Stan,You do? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97906,Stan,Yeah. Like a good writers assistant. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97908,Stan,Yeah. So you really don’t think Wendy will be upset that I used ChatGPT to respond to her texts? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97912,Stan,So you were just saying it was understandable…. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97923,Stan,Oh god o no no the GPT stuff on her phone didn’t come from her. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97931,Stan,"I don’t know what to do. I am not creative enough to think of a way out of this. Wait, that's it! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97936,Stan,No what about her? 
26,4,Deep Learning,97942,Stan,Hold it right there! 
26,4,Deep Learning,97943,Stan,"Look, everyone. We can't blame people who are using ChatGPT. It's not their fault. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97947,Stan,"I tell you who. It's the giant tech companies who took OpenAI, packaged it, monetized it, and pushed it out to all of us as fast as they could in order to get ahead. OpenAI is so powerful that it has to be something that everyone can use, control and contribute to, or else AI will be controlled by corporations who just want an unfair advantage like Cartman does. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97951,Stan,We don't want big corporations deciding what is ethical and acceptable for AI. We were all taken advantage of and that's why my girlfriend will totally understand that I used ChatGPT to respond to her text. 
26,4,Deep Learning,97961,Stan,"You're welcome, sweetheart! "
26,4,Deep Learning,97965,Stan,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97967,Stan,"Well, at least now we know that sometimes a good old thumbs-up from a human is better than a machine-generated lie. "
26,4,Deep Learning,97970,Stan,"ChatGPT, dude. "
